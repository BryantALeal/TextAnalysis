1,2004-04-02T13:52:23+00:00,andre1969,"I saw both a Colorado and a Malibu in DC. I know neither one is the cutting edge of newness, but this is only like the second time I've seen a Colorado on the roads, and maybe the third time I've seen a new Malibu!"
2,2004-04-02T15:25:54+00:00,lemko,...but I saw a Mazda 3 last week.
3,2004-04-02T15:28:12+00:00,andre1969,"sometimes though, at a quick glance it takes me a moment to distinguish the 4-door model. If I only catch it in passing, which means that the first thing my vision fixes on is the roofline, my first thought is '95-99 Neon. At a quick glance, the rooflines are very similar."
4,2004-04-02T16:07:00+00:00,PF_Flyer,"Yea, we can have some retroactive sightings to get this going... but not too far back! Don't want anyone reporting seeing their first AMC Pacer! LOL

Haven't seen a Mazda 3 yet... hmm... this is kind of similar to bird watching. Maybe we need an occasional checklist of things we should try to spy on the road.

5,2004-04-02T16:55:26+00:00,ghulet,"....haven't seen a Maxx yet, also have seen a Mazda3, but it was at the dealer, does that count? I live in the middle of the city, don't get out much during the day, work at midnight like three miles from home, so the chances of my seeing too many new cars are kinda slim. Woe is me."
6,2004-04-02T18:13:53+00:00,mirth,"Saw a Chrysler 300C on the road the other day (Detroit area). Looked very good in person.

Saw an xB in Ann Arbor, MI. Neat looking, IMO."
7,2004-04-02T20:13:52+00:00,kenjabi,"In Maryland near DC, I first saw an xB about a month ago, and saw it again yesterday. Funny thing, it has a big website advertisement slapped to the sides of it (missed the name of the site, though).

I've also seen two Malibu Maxxes within the last week."
8,2004-04-02T21:04:51+00:00,player4,"In Louisville, KY. I've seen a 2005 Chrysler Town & Country last week and I also saw a 2005 Nissan Altima at a parking lot at the mall too. I also saw a 2004 Cadillac XLR in the Interstate it was VERY nice.
Also seen the 2004 BMW X3, 2004 Pontiac GTO, 2004 Nissan Pathfinder Armada, 2004 Saab 93 Convertible, 2004 Chevrolet Malibu and Malibu Maxx, 2005 Ford Escape, 2004 Chevrolet Aveo, 2004 Mazda3, 2004 Chevrolet Colorado, 2004 BMW 5-Series, 2004 Infiniti QX56, 2004 Toyota Solara Convertible, 2004 Porsche Cayenne Turbo, and 2004 Chrysler Crossfire."
9,2004-04-02T21:11:31+00:00,andys120,"The ""wagon"" (it's really a five door hatch IMO) version of the new 'Bu. I thought it looked far better than the (Malibu) sedan.

What a weird time, when SAAB sells a four-door but no hatch and Chebby sells a five-door hatch and both are made by GM."
10,2004-04-02T21:48:20+00:00,seminole_kev,"If I remember correctly the Malibu and SAAB 9-3 are on the same platform, yet Chevy has a 5-door hatch and the 9-3 has the sedan. Crazy I tell ya. Crazy!"
11,2004-04-02T23:01:44+00:00,ghulet,"....that the Malibu is made on the same platform as the Grand Am? I remember seeing the new 9-3 and being alarmed at how much it looked like an Alero or Grand Am. Yes, I think it's a shame that SAAB no longer has a hatchback, especially now that they're coming back into popularity. Leave it to GM."
12,2004-04-02T23:11:36+00:00,logic1,"shares the epsilon platform with the new Malibu/Maxx, Opel Vectra, and the forth coming G6. The Grand Am and Alero are on a much older platform.

This (imo lovely) Saab hatch will be on the market sometime next year:

13,2004-04-02T23:15:58+00:00,grbeck,"Today I saw a metallic gray Scion xB. It looked quite small on the road, despite the boxy shape. Maybe because I keep comparing it to the bigger Chevy Astro/GMC Safari.

I wonder what that 2005 Mustang was doing in State College, Pa. That is a long way from Dearborn. I hope the car makes it to Harrisburg."

15,2004-04-03T19:16:55+00:00,fintail,Saw an xA and an xB today
16,2004-04-03T21:13:35+00:00,player4,Saw the 2004 Cadillac SRX today!!
17,2004-04-03T22:47:05+00:00,andys120,"Out in front of a Chebby dealer, in bright yellow which didn't favor the car as much as the black that I saw a couple of weeks ago."
18,2004-04-04T09:02:08+00:00,tbcreative,"Over the past year, I've seen something else around the Phoenix Metro area, that isn't even due to come to the states for another year. On 3 different occasions, I have seen the Nissan X-Trail. I'm not sure whether it was the same vehicle or not, but all 3 were silver. I've heard you can get one imported here, but you have to go through some channels. My most recent sighting was today, in the Ahwatukee Best Buy parking lot, so I actually got a chance to walk around it and check it out. It was very nice. It had Georgia license plates, and was parked next to a Ford Escape, which it was nearly identical to, dimension-wise.

I'm surprised Nissan hasn't introduced it here yet, because I think it would be a top seller, easily out-selling the latest SUV offerings from Mitsubishi."
19,2004-04-04T09:40:06+00:00,tbcreative,"One of the best things about living in Phoenix, if you're a car nut, is the fact that everyone has proving grounds here. I've been seeing all of the above mentioned vehicles for at least a few weeks. What excites me is vehicles that haven't been introduced yet. I've seen everything from the New Beetle to the XC90, and the 300M to the Armada, long before they were due to hit dealerships.

But what really puts a big ol' grin on my mug is seeing spy vehicles! I haven't seen too many of them, but it's exciting to see them when I do. My most recent sighting was the new Land Rover Discovery, or LR3, as it's now called, which I just saw about a week and a half ago, while driving home from work. I was so excited, I called my dad and described it as I was cruising along side it. I didn't follow it all the way to it's destination, as I was meeting my family for dinner, but I talked with Brenda Priddy about it (she lives close to me, and we've become friends). She told me about Ford doing some testing with the '05 Mustang here, and perhaps they're also doing some weather testing for the LR3. I've seen the spy shots, and photos of it, but it looked cool in reality, even with all of the black-out, spy stuff on it. I just saw the latest Truck Trend, which has the best photo I've seen of it.

Now, if I could just see an H3..."
20,2004-04-04T21:07:50+00:00,wimsey1,"I've seen an SSR sitting at a dealer too. Anyone know how they are selling?
There is a blue SRT-4 in our little town, the owner seems like a rather nice kid."
21,2004-04-05T04:17:56+00:00,bksward,"The week of New Year's I saw a Ford 500 in San Diego. It was the day of the Holiday Bowl and near the stadium.

Mazda 3s are all over the place down here. As are the Scions (a lot more xBs than xAs...) But the Scions have been on sale for around 9 months here.

Saw a both a Pathfinder Armada on I-5 today and a Nissan Titan in a parking lot in Pacific Beach. Also the new Durango.

I've seen several Gallardos as well, but I work across the street from the service center for the local Lambo dealer."
22,2004-04-05T11:38:10+00:00,lemko,...near the Sports Complex in Philadelphia - a new black Rolls-Royce Phantom.
23,2004-04-07T15:16:18+00:00,jaserb,"It actually looked more awkward in person than in the pics, to me anyway. Surprising because I liked the pics. It was in kind of an unattractive beige/brown color, so that probably didn't help. Black or silver would work better.

24,2004-04-07T21:04:07+00:00,vikd,"...saw an '04 GTO yesterday. Pretty unremarkable exterior wise...

25,2004-04-07T21:36:51+00:00,i_luv_toyota,"Saw a Nissan Titan the other day. First one I've seen since they've been on sale. I did see the SUV version of the Titan, the Armada, a month back at the Mohegan Sun Casino parking garage here in Connecticut (it had NY plates, though...)."
26,2004-04-07T23:15:13+00:00,fintail,One of the high level corporate cronyists at work has a new Armada. Is there some kind of styling theme out there where a vehicle is made to intentionally seem obese? It seems over-wrought at every angle.
27,2004-04-08T01:17:54+00:00,fintail,"Are Scions being sold nationwide yet? I saw yet another xB today, this one dark blue"
28,2004-04-08T02:33:25+00:00,bretaa,"Saw all of those here in Minnesota this week. The GTO does look purposeful, but it is clearly an older design. It was parked next to a late model Mercury Cougar, and I'd hate to say which was the ""fresher"" design...

The 300C is another case entirely. It has tremendous road presence and is very fresh. I couldn't help but think ""modern day Bentley"" when I was parked next to it.

I know the SRX has been out a while, but I saw my first one here. It does attract attention. I still think it comes away looking a wee narrow, and not as ""planted"" as I would like.

My $0.02.

29,2004-04-08T15:00:56+00:00,carguy58,"Seen about 13 Acura TL's that I counted.

Seen about 11 Mazda 3's so far(When I go to work sometimes I see a young girl driving a 3 going the opposite way.)

I saw a Nissan Pathfinder Armada way back in December or something.

Seen about 4 Chrysler Crossfire's(not alot of them around.)

Seen about 4 04 Mitsubishi Galants so far(all 4 in the same day as a matter fact and haven't seen one since.)

Also have seen a few Caddy SRX's around.
Seen about maybe 6-10 04 BMW 5 Series around."
30,2004-04-08T16:29:41+00:00,vikd,"...the GTO is simply a watered down version of the Volvo C70. I appreciate that Pontiac did away with the cladding theme on the GTO, but they could have made the vehicle just a bit more striking in appearance as would befit the GTO badge. It is one heck of a ""sleeper"" though! Lots of folks getting fooled at the stop light drags I'll bet...

Still waiting to see a 300 on the street; saw one on the turntable at the auto show but that's it. Looking forward to see ing the Magnum in person as well.

31,2004-04-08T17:09:33+00:00,lemko,"...I'd get a GTO and put one of those little ""E"" Enterprise car rental decals on it and fool people into thinking it's a rental Grand Prix."

33,2004-04-08T17:38:48+00:00,andre1969,"has a son who works as a tech at a Chrysler dealership. He said that the 300's are in stock now. They only got a few of them though, and naturally, they're loaded to the gills. <sigh> Looks like it's gonna be the Pacifica/K-car/Volare all over again!"
34,2004-04-08T17:39:58+00:00,andre1969,"that's a sick idea, but I kinda like it! It'd be a nice practical joke...maybe if one of my co-workers ever shows up with a GTO, I'll do it to them! ;-)"
35,2004-04-08T18:22:26+00:00,seminole_kev,"I dunno. That 300c (specifically the ""c"" version with the V8) intriques me. I might, in a year or two, get a new car and I'm mulling the idea of a big cruiser that might still be a little fun. The 300c is the only version of the 300 I'd be interested in. So I'm hoping they have a bunch of loaded c's in stock (ok minus the sunroof) in dark blue ;-)

Actually, I'd probably just order it from the factory.

it's weird, but there's something about the 300c that draws me too it. Can't quite figure it out. I'll have to go drive it to see if I might get one, or hate its size enough not to be tempted by it."
36,2004-04-08T18:30:57+00:00,andre1969,"the 300C intrigues me too! When I made a reference to the Volare/K-car/Pacifica though, what I meant was that they still seem to be repeating their old habits of only offering fully loaded-up models at first, which tends to hurt sales. They made that mistake with the Volare in '76, and almost botched the launch of the K-car by only offering loaded models to begin with, and did the same thing with the Pacifica.

I agree though, that the Hemi C is probably the only model I'd be interested in, but I'm also not ready to pay $30K+ for car yet! My Intrepid came out to about $22.3K out the door, and looking back, sometimes I wish I hadn't spent that much, and just got a used one instead.

With a 3.5, the 300 might not be TOO bad, but this car just screams out for the Hemi! And I think I have a rough idea of about how a 300 with the 2.7 will peform. Probably about the same as my Intrepid with 4 people on board and a trunk full of luggage. Umm, no thanks!"
37,2004-04-08T18:39:25+00:00,seminole_kev,"oddly enough I had a talk with the wife over breakfast this morning about a...(ahem) hypothetical situation if I was to buy a new car in a year or so about how much she'd be comfortable with me spending. (Hey she runs the checkbook and does a hell of a lot better job than I can/did!). Specifically targeting the 300c optioned out the way I want (approx $35,000 MSRP). Well she didn't have a problem with that. So woo hoo.

Then she turned around and said ""This isn't about that Chrysler you've been looking at is it!?!?! No! No way you're spending that much money on a Chrysler! A Chrysler?!?!?"" She then proceded to rattle off a few ""suggestions"" as to what other cars I should look at in that price range ;-)

I'm going to look around at quite a wide range of cars, but I'm going to give the 300c a fair shake. I think she has a little issue with the Chrysler name though ;-)

*To be fair, she works for a law firm that handles bankruptcies for DaimlerChrysler, so I think she's also burnt out on the name."
38,2004-04-08T19:57:42+00:00,ghulet,"I worked at JDRP for ten years, I don't regret my move from law firm slave to bartender one bit!"
39,2004-04-08T20:12:19+00:00,lemko,"...turns out to be all that, I might consider one as a cost-effective alternative to a new STS. The only problem is, I'm happy with Cadillac and Cadillac service in general. I've only owned one Chrysler vehicle - a 1985 Chrysler Fifth Avenue - and it turned out to be one of the best I've ever owned. However, the one experience I had with Chrysler service was awful. I needed a new wheel lock wrench and the surly guy behind the counter gave me a response as if I just told him I slept with his wife. Fortunately, this dealer was bought out by somebody else so maybe things have changed."
40,2004-04-09T01:42:31+00:00,andys120,"Automobile sez the 300C comes with a 3.5 V6
and is only 2.5 sec slower to 60 than the V8 which puts it in the mid 7s.

I'm anxious to see one of those."
41,2004-04-09T12:11:35+00:00,andre1969,"yeah, I just read my issue of Motortrend last nite, and in addition to the 300C with the Hemi, which gave 0-60 in 5.3 seconds, they also tested a Magnum wagon with the 3.5, and got 0-60 in 7.5 seconds.

I think that's actually pretty impressive, considering that with the 300M/LHS/Intrepid R/T, lighter cars using the same engine, 0-60 was more like 7.8-8 seconds or so. In the RWD Magnum and 300 though, the 3.5 uses the same 4-speed automatic as the Jeep Wrangler and the V-6 Dakota/Durango. Maybe the RWD tranny is just more effective at putting the power to the wheels? I've heard that with the FWD tranny, they designed it so that it doesn't make the most use of the engine's power...if they did it would shred it!

I think the 3.5 now also has a revised intake that gives it a broader torque curve, so that might help, too. The 3.5 (and 2.7 and 3.2) in the LH cars tended to be pretty ""peaky"" when it came to power."
42,2004-04-09T15:52:55+00:00,vikd,"...at the Chrysler dealership. It was the Limited with the 250 horse 3.5. I asked my salesman why it was sitting in the corner of the lot, he replied that it was sold within 3
hours of it's arrival!

I really like the vehicle after having walked around it a few times. The doors were open and I was allowed to sit in it. The rear seat accomodations are more than adequate for even someone my size. The overall feel of the vehicle is muscular and purposeful. The salesmen milling around kept referring to it as the ""Chrysler Bentley"". This may be a turn off to some but I can appreciate the departure from the same old-same old that the vehicle represents. The interior is also very nice with most surfaces feeling of high quality and soft to the touch. The steering wheel has a thick solid feel to it along the lines of say, an M5 and the like.

This Limited stickered at around 33k with a 2995 adm tacked on.

Regards... Vikd"
43,2004-04-09T16:08:51+00:00,andre1969,"looks like I might have to go 300 hunting this weekend. I don't plan on bagging anything on this little safari (I'll make sure to leave the checkbook at home, but hell, they take credit cards nowadays!), but I'd like to at least give the car a test-sit and if I'm lucky, a test drive!"
44,2004-04-09T16:12:50+00:00,andys120,
45,2004-04-09T16:27:21+00:00,wimsey1,"Heres a thought for Chrysler, Give it a manual trans. and some suspension work and under cut the CTS-V with a special model. It's only a few ticks away on acceleration with the auto trans and I think AMG could make it handle even better than it does now.
For all my snarling at the 300's styling I think it could turn out to be a winner for Chrysler. America likes BIG."
46,2004-04-09T17:20:03+00:00,vikd,"...I agree. Though it is far too early to make any predictions, the fact that the few 300's that have hit dealer lots are being snatched up so quick is a good start. My salesman at the Chry shop said that the only reason the Limited wasn't delivered yet is because they are waiting for premier night to do it ""in style"".

Regards... Vikd"
47,2004-04-09T20:46:01+00:00,andys120,"coming at me, but didn't get a good look cuz it was going in opposite direction, it was either
a DB7 or a Vanquish.

It looked sleek, low and very fast with nothing boy-racer about it, just the way I like cars."
48,2004-04-10T16:35:17+00:00,wimsey1,Amen! Looking at an Asotn is always a good experience.
49,2004-04-10T19:12:57+00:00,seminole_kev,"Just looked at a Chrysler 300 today (only had the base model which is not what I'm looking for). Since it wasn't the ""C"" version, I didn't bother driving it, but the car looks well put together and thought out. Salesman really turned me off though. Hopefully this was just a bad salesman, but wasn't a good start for Chrylser trying to change my image of them.

Looking forward to giving the 300c a whirl."
0,2004-04-11T03:12:32+00:00,andre1969,"but I sat in two 300's today. I hadn't planned on it originally...I was supposed to do some stuff around the house, but one of my buddies asked me if I wanted to ride with him to the dealer to buy a new headlight assembly for his '95 Grand Marquis.

I said what the hey, and rode with him out to the dealer in Annapolis. Well, I knew there was a Chrysler dealer nearby somewhere, so I said let's go see if we can find it, and see if they got the new 300's in.

It didn't take long to find the dealer, and as he pulled in, I spotted a silver one. What I did next kind of embarrassed my buddy, and I dunno if he's ever going to go car shopping with me again! I just pointed at it, and like a little kid, shouted ""MINE!!""

My friend, who's a high school teacher, made some kind of comment about my juvenile behavior, but I was out the door before he even stopped the car! Just to get on his nerves, I think I even blurted out ""MINE"" a few more times!

Anyway, this one was just a base model, with the 2.7. I think it stickered for around $24,500. It was silver with kind of a charcoal-ish interior. The salesguy let me sit behind the wheel and try everything out. Finally, I was able to lay all my fears about legroom to rest. Previously I'd been a bit worried because the specs rate these cars at around 41.8"", whereas the outgoing Intrepid/Concorde/300M are 42.2"". Might not sound like a big deal, but I wish my 'Trep had more legroom! So I was afraid these things would simply be too small for me. Thankfully, this was not the case. I was able to get the seat into a position that was perfect for me. In fact, it was so far back that the steering wheel was out of my reach! And I have long arms, so that's really saying something!

It does have a tilt-telescope feature, but in base models it's activated by a clunky lever that feels like it could get stuck or break. The 300C has power controls. The tranny hump does take a pretty big bite out of the footwell area...much more than the older RWD Mopars like my '89 Gran Fury or '79 New Yorker, but it was still good enough for my needs. Also, they may say that ""Cab Forward"" is dead, but the base of this car's windshield was at least as far away from me as my Intrepid's.

Admittedly, the interior is a bit cheap. Lots of hard plastic. In comparison, my Intrepid, with cloth and carpeting inserts on the door panel almost seems like a luxury car in comparison. There's no carpeting on the door panels (although I think they also dropped that from the Intrepid in 2002), and the carpeting on the floor is a really cheap grade, probably about on par with what's in my roommate's '98 Tracker. The seats were also made out of this weird cloth that made me think of outdoor furniture, or maybe what would be in a Jeep.

In the back, with the front seat set to where I'm comfortable, I could fit back there, but truthfully I think my Intrepid is more comfortable. The center spot in the 300 is also almost unusable, at least to my way of thinking. The driveshaft hump isn't a problem. In fact, while the tranny hump up front seemed pretty big, in comparison to RWD Mopars of years gone by, the driveshaft hump in back was pretty small. But the center spot is still poorly padded, and feels like it's raised up a bit, and the pull-down armrest really digs into my back.

The trunk's rated at 15.6 cubic feet, and has the spare tire stored underneath, like most FWD cars...or a Dart! It's not bad, but down considerably from the Intrepid's 18.4 (the Concorde is 18.8). But the seatbacks do fold down, to improve versatility. And the hinges are the strut-mount type, so you don't have those ""gooseneck"" hinges to mess with your luggage. The battery's in the trunk too, in the well with the tire. Much easier to get to than the LH cars, where it's buried in front of the right-side front wheel well, under the air filter.

Under the hood, the 2.7 looks like it's a bit more serviceable than it does under the hood of my Intrepid. When my Intrepid needed new belts, I didn't even attempt to tackle it myself...it was such a tight squeeze that I knew I'd end up with bruised knuckles and a bad attitude, and probably end up sending it to the repair shop anyway. With the 300 though, I might actually have the guts to tackle that job! Changing the oil might be a pain, though. I couldn't find the oil filter, but if it's in the same place that it is on my '00 Intrepid, then on this car, it looks like there's a big plastic cover you have to take off of the bottom of the car. It was most likely put there to improve aerodynamics.

While I was looking at this silver base model, the other 300 they had, a Magnesium 300C Hemi, came back from the test drive. It was pretty well loaded, with a sunroof. Nicer carpet...better than a Tracker, and about on par with my Intrepid. More chrome accents and the fake tortoise shell (I love reptiles though, so if it was made of the real thing I'd boycott it!), and leather really dressed up the interior.

I've been able to find a lot of nitpicks with the 300, but dammit, I want one!!

Oh yeah, they also had some Pacificas, and I finally got to sit behind the wheel of one, and adjust the seat to where I'm comfortable. At the auto show, they yank the battery cables, so you can't adjust the power seats. I was able to get comfortable in it. I kinda like 'em, but all of a sudden, I do have a lusting for a 300C! The Magnesium example they had, though, stickered for about $35,000. They are currently offering a $1000 rebate for current Mopar owners, but I think I'm going to wait for the 0.9% financing +4,000 cash back! ;-) Or just wait till they start hitting the used car market. I learned, first-hand, with my Intrepid how fast a new car can depreciate. I dunno if I want to go through that again!

Between the darkness, the wet roads and dark color of the car, the scene looked like something straight out of an advertisement. The car really stood out, with the taillights looking especially distinctive."

Also saw an orange xB, which looked like it was being test driven, with window sticker and temp plate on it. I didn't like the color, plus the car had no rims! It looked like it was running on four spares. They don't even have factory wheels?"

Somebody mentioned awhile back on Edmund's that the Maxx reminds them of the old '83-86 Camry hatchback. I can really see that resemblance, except I think the Camry pulled it off a bit better.

Still, it's...interesting!"
21,2004-04-21T20:10:00+00:00,vikd,"...even though the rear seats recline, it still felt like sitting on a bench seat or something similar; not much support anywhere. Also, the fact that I can't even get my golf clubs in the trunk without foliding down one side of the rear seats crossed it off the list for us. The trunk is truly tiny; the tricky PT Cruiser-like tray only serves smaller applications. I will say that the Maxx was fairly enjoyable to drive...

22,2004-04-21T20:34:17+00:00,wimsey1,"There is one of those Camry hatchs up my street and I would have to agree, the Maxx really resembles it but the Camry is better proportioned. Maybe I was the one who commented on it, I don't remember.
The rear seat comments jibe well with my experience at the auto show, funny, I never did look at the trunk. I guess you don't get something for nothing."
23,2004-04-21T20:36:37+00:00,wimsey1,Have you driven a Mazda 6 hatch or wagon? I know the sedan is great handling. Anyone know if the 6 wagon can be had with the manual trans?
24,2004-04-21T22:59:59+00:00,vikd,"...have not driven the hatch or wagon, but I did drive the sedan version in base form. Even in base 6i trim, the vehicle was very enjoyable to drive. Relatively peppy 4 cyl and handled and cornered excellently. Rear seat accomodations are still not what we would like. Perhaps that is addressed with either the hatch or wagon versions; havent seen either in person as of yet.

25,2004-04-22T15:10:45+00:00,andre1969,"this is, but this morning I saw a Mitsubishi Lancer station wagon. It looked kinda like an '82 Cavalier wagon with an upside-down Pontiac grille put on. I didn't even know they made a wagon version of the Lancer...shows ya how much I pay attention to them!

Vikd, let us know how the 6 hatch and/or wagon feel, in comparison to the sedan. In the past, I've notice that wagons are actually usually a bit tighter in the back seat than sedans. Like maybe they move the seat up just a bit for a bigger load area? Or maybe the fact that the seat now has to fold down has something to do with it?"
26,2004-04-22T17:48:41+00:00,stickguy,"feels roomier in the back seat than the sedan, because of increased headroom (otherwise seems the same). The hatch IMO loses a little headroom.

1,2004-04-28T16:15:18+00:00,andys120,"I swung by the local Chrysler store to have a look at the 300s. They are good-looking, even the base model has a nice stance on the road.

The car doesn't look as massive in person as in photos nor does the grille seem so large.

The car has clean lines so it should wear well even after there are millions on the road. The squashed roof might look gimmicky after time though.

The interior was a very good effort let down mostly by the fact that the leather (300C) didn't have a pleasing smell, though it looked very nice.

I was mildly disappointed by the ""Tortise-Shell"" accents on the wheel and gearshift. They were opaque and looked like plood rather than translucent which would be a classy update on the translucent plastic often used in 50s and 60s designs.

I liked the ""Cool Vanilla"" color on one of the 300Cs, a cream white alternative to the metallic colors so common now."

I can't say much good about the sedan styling, but oddly, the Maxx struck me as better looking than the sedan.

9,2004-04-29T15:43:19+00:00,andre1969,"I drove up to PA on Saturday and met with Grbeck, and we went to the Spring Carlisle swap meet. I saw 10 300's on the road going up there! And then we saw one at a car dealer, a white one with the 3.5, but I forget if it was a Limited or a Touring.

Okay, I gotta come clean. Those 10 300's I saw? They were on a an auto carrier heading southbound, so I guess that doesn't really count! ;-)

The first 300 I ever saw actually WAS a base model. Three Saturdays ago, I was out with a buddy of mine. He needed to get a new headlight assembly for his '95 Grand Marquis, and while we were out we stopped at a Chrysler dealer to see if they had any 300's. They had a silver base model that stickered for $24,995. While we were there though, the C came back from a test drive. Nice, pretty $35K Magnesium model. Me want!!"
10,2004-04-29T15:58:15+00:00,andys120,"I doubt you'd have any trouble fitting into it.

Here's a little irony about the Cool Vanilla..
White was a popular color for the original C-300,
300B/C/D (only available in black white or Red IIRC). Most 1950s cars that were white were really off-white or cream colored but the early 300s were a pure Snow white and stood out because of it.

The irony is that Snow white has become nearly ubiquitous for white autos, so the new 300s go to an off-white and stand out because of it."
11,2004-04-29T17:19:07+00:00,kenjabi,"Last weekend, I saw a new BMW 5-Series AND a new 6-Series on the streets, both in black, for the first time. I didn't get a very long look at either, but the first impression was pretty good, definitely better than the 7-series.

Also saw a yellow SSR--again, first time I've seen that model, but it was too far away to really form an opinion. But it stood out, even from afar."
12,2004-04-29T17:43:25+00:00,andre1969,"I didn't do a test drive, but at least got to do a test-sit on the 300, and it fit me just fine! I actually had my worries about this car, because going just however they measure it, it somehow comes up less than the Intrepid. The Intrepid is rated at 42.2"", and I think the 300 is rated at 41.8"".

Now most people would say hey, that's not even a half-inch. However, my Intrepid is barely adequate for me! On longer trips, I end up driving barefoot, so that I can stretch out my legs a bit further. So naturally, I was worried about a car that actually had less! BTW, IIRC a Camry also has about 41.8"" of legroom up front, and I find them to be a bit cramped for legroom.

Anyway, all those fears went away when I sat in the car, and put the seat so far back that I couldn't even comfortably reach the steering wheel! It does have the tilt-telescope feature standard, but honestly on the cheap models it's a clunky, awkward thing that feels easy to break.

IMO, the interior does show a few signs of cost cutting, but that's pretty much par for the course nowadays, so it's nothing I'd single out the 300 in particular for. Still, I'd rate it a bit below my Intrepid. Mainly for little things, like the cheap looking carpeting, the cloth on the seats that looks something you'd use on indoor/outdoor furniture, and the sparse-looking door panels. Call me old fashioned, but I like to see some carpeting, and fabric that matches the seats! Enough with this stuff that you actually have to push against with all your might, just to see if it's soft-touch or hard!"

16,2004-04-29T18:44:21+00:00,seminole_kev,"in my personal opinion the 300C does look much nicer inside than the lesser models. I've sat in both recently and the lesser models look somewhat cheap to me (although in reality, it is probably about right for the $25K and under market save for Audi/VW interiors). But the 300C looked nicer. Has chrome and faux-metal accents plus the either Tortoise shell or wood interior accents. It looks nicer to me. Plus the leather is of a better quality than the other versions.

Just my two cents."
17,2004-04-29T19:01:34+00:00,andre1969,"I'd say that, compared to something like an M-body 5th Avenue, it's really a hard call. If you like a car like a 5th Ave, and equate that to luxury, than the newer models are just going to look cheap for the most part. Similarly, I don't think there's a Buick made at any price today that's as nice inside as my Grandma's '85 LeSabre Limited was.

For instance, the carpeting they used in nicer cars back then simply puts the newer stuff to shame, and in general they just padded things better back then. Not necessarily in cheaper cars, but nicer cars were pretty plush. Also, Chrysler went out of their way in the 5th Ave to cover things like the A- and B-pillar trim with fabric that matched the headliner, instead of just leaving hard, exposed plastic. And the dashboard on the M-bodies used a high-quality type of padding that's very resistant to cracking, and has almost a leather-like texture.

Now, the parts fit together better on the 300 than they did on the old M-body cars. Gaps are tighter and more even, and the window frames are thicker, so you're not getting in with a wire hanger, like I used to with my old Gran Fury!

BTW Lemko, there was this gorgeous '88 (I think) 5th Avenue at Carlisle this past weekend for sale. It was white, and looked showroom new. Maybe it's a sad commentary on these types of shows that cars like this are starting to show up so frequently, but this sucker WAS nice! They wanted something like $4400 for it, which was pretty extreme for something of that vintage. But damn, was it schweet!

Oh yeah, one area where the 300 definitely comes up superior to the M-body in comfort, is the steering wheel. I love the legroom on the M-body, and the footwell area is wider than on the 300, so your legs aren't as tight together. But the steering wheel on the old M- is just a bit too close for my comfort."
18,2004-04-29T19:03:15+00:00,andys120,it didn't smell nice. An upholsterer once told me that's because they don't use the best leather.
19,2004-04-29T19:03:56+00:00,andre1969,"I almost had another added to that list. My Granddad, who's going to be turning 90 in October, decided not to renew his license. So he's giving up his '94 Taurus. My Dad called me at work today and asked me if I wanted it, because they'd give it to me. At first I said yes, but then thought more about it, and called him back and said no. It was a good learning experience for me, because I think I've actually lost count of how many ""free"" cars have been dumped on me! Free isn't always a good thing, when you have to get it inspected, insured, find a place in the yard for it, fix it when it breaks, etc."
20,2004-04-29T19:38:35+00:00,seminole_kev,"was it a 300C or a different version of the 300 you looked at? The ""Limited"" and ""Touring"" versions have different, cheaper leather than the ""C"" version."
21,2004-04-29T19:44:13+00:00,andre1969,"the one I really looked at hard and heavy was just a base 300. When the Magnesium 300C pulled up though, I went over and looked at it. I liked some stuff, like the leather, but as for the plastic goes, if it was hard-looking plastic in the base 300, it was still hard-looking plastic in the 300C. I think the carpeting was a higher grade too though, I'm not sure. And with the two-toning with that dark green look, well, I'm a sucker for certain shades of green, anyway!

The car's not perfect, but it's nice enough that I'm in lust with it I like my Intrepid, but I have a feeling that if I were to trade it in on a 300C, I wouldn't be missing it too much!"

23,2004-04-29T19:54:59+00:00,uga91,"I saw a Cheval Zafira in the driver's license bureau in Columbus, GA this morning. It had Chevrolet badging and a Mexican license plate. I think the car is sold in Europe as well as an Opel Zafira. It looked like a shrunken version of the old Mazda MPV (with the 4 real doors, not sliding doors) and it had a rear end similar to the Mazda Tribute. It had alloy wheels and a roof rack and was not a bad looking car."
24,2004-04-29T21:02:29+00:00,player4,"Yesterday I saw a silver 2005 Chrysler 300, it was the base package (300) it was real nice and the interior looks great!! The wheel covers are HUGE and so are the tires!! I was very impressed to see how nice this car is and probably is the first Chrysler that i like for real. The 300 was parke right next to my car at a Wal-Mart parking lot."
25,2004-04-29T21:41:54+00:00,andys120,Didn't really look at the base interior.
26,2004-04-29T21:50:24+00:00,wale_bate1,"I saw a new 645ci today in white. Once again, the real thing beats the pics. In person, it's not nearly as Chrysler Sebring LXi 'vert as it is in the photos.

Still doesn't give me that ""oooo, gotta have one"" stirring in my loins, so to speak, but it's better than I thought.

[sigh]

These are not the best of times for styling, methinks."
27,2004-04-30T01:12:18+00:00,stickguy,"Autoweek came today. They have a humor page, and often do a body double box. This week, they had as ""switched at birth"" the 300C and the Green Hornet's car. Actually pretty close."
28,2004-04-30T20:09:47+00:00,ghulet,"In the past two days, I've seen a new (black) 645 CSi with dark tinted windows (illegal in IL, or at least Chicago) and an X3. The Bangle-desh rear end is just hideous on the 6, the rest of the car is nice. There's just no continuity in the design. The X3 looked fine (hard to botch a two-box SUV), except for the black bumpers. I like them on a practical basis, but the overall effect was that the vehicle looked cheap. I mean, didn't they learn anything after everyone whined about the '92 3-series? Bumpers went body color in '93."
29,2004-05-03T07:40:01+00:00,wimsey1,"Mitsu Evo, second I've seen.

30,2004-05-03T11:48:21+00:00,andre1969,"I saw my first new GTO, outside of an auto show. It was silver. Not a bad looking car, but it just doesn't stand out and grab your attention, although I'm sure the silver color didn't help much!"
31,2004-05-03T15:11:39+00:00,stormdavy,"saw my first (moving and being driven) 300 in greater Chicagoland area. It was a Touring or Limited; no chrome strip on back bumper. Very regal presence (first noticed it coming up behind me), and different from most photos as its frontal appearance is altered by those lit headlights. Evokes classic car proportions. Nice and trim, great light color Jade something.

Later checked 3 at my dealer - 2 300Cs, 1 Limited. The front clips of these two trim levels are completely, though subtly different.
And I find the less complicated rear styling of the base models (no sonar ""bumps""; no chrome strip) just fine; they don't scream 'entry level'.

Impressed and excited by this sortie of Chryslers into the new RWD full-size market. The car now a symbol of a scrappy new era what with parent company/ corporate/ managerial changes afoot."

38,2004-05-11T16:36:14+00:00,bretaa,"300C: Lots on the road here in MN and in RI. Also have seen two Crossfires on the road.

2005(?) Focus: The Ford dealer here in town has the redesigned Focus with the new toned done (boring?)Euro-look front clip and interior. The front comes off much better looking than in photos. It's more mature and upscale appearing, definitely in line with the Euro Mondeo, although the jury's out if its better looking. I didn't get a good look at the interior.

Mazda 6: All variations now on the road. Oddly, I've seen more 6 hatches here in MN than Malibu Maxxs...

Audi A3 and a 4dr Alfa sedan: Both seen in NYC on trips over the past year, both with diplomatic plates. The Alfa was gorgeous, and the A3, while clean, doesn't really stand out... Tons of people were walking by it on the street and despite its rarity, no one was giving it a glance... I've also seen the Chevy zafira that someone else mentioned (with Mexico plates) here in MN. I don't know why Saturn isn't selling those...

39,2004-05-13T03:20:32+00:00,kmag,"I came out of the library and a silver 300 was parked next to me. Another guy was admiring it and we chatted for a minute. He liked it alot. I do too, although I will probably never be in the market for such a car.

What surprised me was how high the beltline is. The pictures make it look low slung, at least to me.

It is certainly a radical departure from the Intrepid-based cars...which is a good thing. Now if they could apply some of that magic to the desparately-needed replacements for the Stratus and the Neon....."
40,2004-05-13T18:34:06+00:00,lemko,Saw both a silver and a black 300 today.
41,2004-05-13T22:30:58+00:00,andre1969,"he was complaining about the fuel economy of his 2003 (IIRC) Ram, which has a 4.7. He says the way gas prices are getting, he's thinking of trading it in. What's he thinking about trading on? A 300C, of course! Go figure.

If nothing else, it SHOULD get much better economy than his Ram. The 300C is rated around 17/24-25, whereas his Ram is probably 14/19. I still think it's funny though, to be worried about gas prices, and be considering a Hemi!"
42,2004-05-14T04:45:22+00:00,wimsey1,"I've actually wondered if the 300 wouldn't draw from the truck crowd. I think some truck buyers are buying the ""big sedan"" that no one is selling anymore (I don't count the ancient platforms that need replacement).
Saw a Magnum at the local dealer today. Looks alright. I think the roof line is pretty good.

Also saw a Colorado in a parking lot today. It didn't bother me at the show but today I actually flinched when I saw it in broad daylight. Maybe it will wear in a bit but right now...argh. In particular the wheel arch accents are revolting, bad geometric parodies of the nasty ones on the Tacoma. Rotten looking little truck IMO. Seems like every Chevy lately is a nasty geometric mess.

OK, I'm calm again.

Bretaa-Seen a few 6 hatches too. Every time I see a 6 it looks better, by far the sharpest midsize. I think I've still seen more Maxxes, but I've seen more of those than 'Bu sedans also even with the later start date (I don't count the sedans piled up at the local Chevy dealer). With out the Maxx the 'Bu would be a contender for the ""Why bother car introduction of the year"" award."

0,2004-05-27T16:41:04+00:00,andre1969,"here at work just showed up this morning in a new Chrysler 300 Touring, in Cool Vanilla. He wanted a Hemi, but then once he found out what it would do with his insurance, and with fuel costs, and the added price of the car, he figured that the Touring model is more than enough for his needs.

It has me lusting for one more than ever, but make mine Magnesium...and with a Hemi!!

They had a Scion xA at a GM test drive event this past weekend that I went to. I wanted to drive it, but it was getting really hot out, and we were getting hungry. After eating, my friend's stomach acted up, and I started getting a headache (damn GM food! ;-), so we just got in line to drive a Hummer H2, and then called it a day.

I was curious to see how it drove, though. They also had an Aveo there. Smallest thing we drove was a Matrix, and while small cars aren't my thing, it's a decent little car. They had a Maxx there as well, but we just drove the regular Malibu. I'm 6'3"", and had no problem fitting in it. It feels like it has a bit more legroom than the previous Malibu."
1,2004-05-27T20:46:35+00:00,ghulet,"I have to laugh when some moron in the city can't get past double-parked cars on side streets while driving one (as long as I'm not behind it!). I don't think I could afford the gas, let alone the payment!"
2,2004-05-27T21:46:54+00:00,andre1969,"I can't see what the fascination is with the Hummer. Sitting behind the wheel of the thing, it felt like being behind the wheel of a school bus! It was about the same color too, so that might have been part of what made me think of it. But the upright windshield and flat hood made me think of one.

You also really have to put your foot in it to get it to move. It's not like a lot of older cars where you just pop it into gear and it'll lunge forward under its own power. This thing won't idle. About the best analogy I can think of is trying to start off in a car with the parking brake still partially on.

They really don't let you drive that fast on these courses, and with the Hummer, Corvette, and SSR, they have an employee ride with everybody, to keep people from getting too stupid. Most we might've gotten up to was about 25 mph.

They had a little obstacle course set up that was kinda fun, though. The first part put you on an embankment that tilted you either toward the driver's side or the pasenger side, depending on which side you went on. The lady with us said that the driver's side was steeper, so I took it ;-) We were tilted over so far that I started getting worried that we'd tip! I know realistically, that was probably impossible (they wouldn't be THAT stupid, to set up a course like that...would they??), but being inside that thing when it tilted seemed much more extreme than just watching other people drive them on the embankment, while we waited in line!

Then they had this part with alternating craters on either side, so you could see how the suspension takes the bumps. And the last thing was a steep hill. It was a pile of dirt and gravel, maybe 10 feet tall, that you drove up and over, kinda like the first hump on a kiddie coaster or something. Now THAT was kinda fun!

I'll admit, it was fun, but I just don't get it. Even if I had the money, what the hell would I do with the thing? If I were going off-roading, seriously I think I'd try to just get an old Ramcharger, Jeep, Bronco or whatever, that was a little rough around the edges, and I wouldn't cry whenever it got mud on it or a scratch!"
3,2004-05-27T22:13:44+00:00,ajvdh,"My daughter got to do the ""sit in the convertible and wave to the crowd"" think in a local parade last Saturday. The convertible they used was a screaming yellow SSR. She sat on the deck right behind the seats. IMHO, that is one stupid vehicle. All the utility of a sports car and the handling of a pickup in one gas-guzzling package. It's a nice shape, at first, but the more I looked at it, the less I liked it.

Sunday, a local BMW dealer brought a new 545 to our autocross, and let a few lucky souls take it around the course. I didn't get to drive it, but I did ride along. It had the sport package, which gives you an incredible combination of ride and handling. With some of our better drivers at the wheel, it was turning in respectable times despite carrying four people. The consensus among those who drove is that ""active steering"" works very well. I still can't wrap my mind around the shape or price tag.

I've also seen a light green 300C a couple of times around here. That's a car that says, ""Yeah, I'm an American car, got a problem with that?"" And it's good looking enough to carry it off well."
4,2004-05-28T01:02:02+00:00,andys120,"it was nice enough looking, I was struck by how much it looked like a garden variety 911 Carrera fro the side or rear, oversize air intakes in front give it away.

Those are unattractive and not very Porsche-like. They had good reasons for going to water cooling but it's part of the Porsche look to have a smooth front, not gaping holes up front."

7,2004-06-02T16:19:21+00:00,andre1969,"just heard rumors of another 300 showing up here at work, this one a 300C. Evidently one of my former co-workers, who used to work with me but is in another building now, just bought a silver one. I haven't seen it yet, but our office lead, who recently bought a Cool Vanilla Touring edition, saw this guy's daughter getting into it with him.

This guy had been driving an '02 or '03 Ram pickup with a 4.7, just RWD, and complaining about fuel economy! I think he has about a 40 mile commute each way. If I were that concerned about economy, I think I'd get an economy car, but I guess even going from that Ram to a Hemi C, he should see a pretty big boost, especially since his commute is mostly highway."

9,2004-06-02T16:39:48+00:00,andre1969,"I'm torn right now! Part of me wants one, but then there's another part of me that's going to be soooo relieved this November 21, which is when I make the final payment on my Intrepid!

A new Hemi C would be nice, but so would no car payment! Damn I hate being practical (i.e., cheap) sometimes!!"
10,2004-06-02T18:09:43+00:00,stickguy,I can relate to the dilema of wanting new but liking no payments. At least it is fun to look.

14,2004-06-03T13:38:36+00:00,stickguy,"C'mon Andre, how can anyone that has more cars than Shaquille O'neal be poor?"
15,2004-06-03T13:42:19+00:00,andre1969,"but a 300C would probably cost me more than what I paid for all my other cars, combined! (not counting repairs over the years, but just initial purchase price).

I'd also imagine that Shaq doesn't drive Dodges and 20 year old pickup trucks! ;-)"
16,2004-06-03T15:05:37+00:00,andre1969,"just took me for a spin in his 300C. I WANT ONE!!! I'll admit though, that there are a few minor things I don't like. The armrest is supposed to be a soft-touch plastic, but it's one of those textures that you really have to force yourself into before you realize it's soft-touch! Overall, not that comfortable. And the carpeting that they attach to the lower parts of the door panels looks like blonde pubic hair...would've been better to just not put any carpet at all down there if they were just going to use something low-quality. The rest of the carpeting, on the floor, was okay. No better than my Intrepid though, which is kinda sad, considering it stickered for less than 2/3 what this car probably does!

The headliner's made out of a material that's kinda durable looking, like indoor/outdoor furniture, but I just don't find it that upscale looking, although I like the fact that they covered the inside of the A-pillars with it, as well.

As for ride comfort, well, it's pretty obvious this car is set up for performance, and in general you can have a smooth ride or great performance, but rarely both at the same time. Anybody raised on a cushy full-sized 70's or 80's car, and prefers that kind of isolation, will hate it. In contrast, the 300C feels kinda police car-ish, although I don't mind! ;-)

And this car really reinforces the fact that you should never go on what the published legroom is. The 300 and Magnum are only rated at 41.8"" or so in front legroom, which is actually LESS than the Intrepid, 300M, etc that they're replacing (42.2""). But actually sitting inside one, it feels like there's much more stretch-out room."
17,2004-06-03T15:12:53+00:00,stickguy,"RWD usually has more room in the foot wheel, since there is less drivetrain to eat up space. I know that legroom measurements are kinda strange (same with headroom), which is why I always have to test fit.

Andre, time to start rationalizing. You make a payment now, so buy the 300 and keep the payment similar, and it's like getting a new car for nothing. Just ignore the fact that you extended the term 5 years.

FOr the armrest, shouldn't be too hard to get a little pad of some kind to pamper your forearm. And if the blond hair bothers you, get a dark colored interior.

If you need any more help overcoming weak objections or rationalizing, let me know. It's one of my strong points (particularly with other people's money).

At least drive one for yourself. Can't really get a full picture just riding in one."
18,2004-06-03T15:21:13+00:00,andre1969,"my mind is made up. I WILL get one of these things, eventually. Just wanted to point out a few nitpicks, to prove that Chrysler doesn't have me totally brainwashed!! ;-)

I think mine's gonna be Magnesium. Either that, or that light jade green.

Oh yeah, I just found out something of interest, as well...the supplier of the sunroofs for the 300 has run out! My office lead, who has the touring edition, lucked out and got one with a sunroof, but the guy who just got the 300C ordered his, and they had to call him back and tell him their supplier ran out of sunroofs! He asked them who their second source supplier was (he's good at technical talk like that) and the guy just went ""uuuuuhhhh...""

I think he said it would have taken a few months to get one with a sunroof, so he just decided to take it, anyway.

I hope the sunroof thing doesn't hurt their sales too much!"
19,2004-06-03T15:31:31+00:00,andre1969,"one other thing I like about the new 300, is that the rear windows roll down all the way. Of course, considering what narrow little slits they are, it would be kinda lame if they didn't!"
20,2004-06-03T18:17:52+00:00,stickguy,"Well, if it was for me, no roof = no sale. I think it will hurt them somewhat, since it is a ""luxury"" car (at least the higher end models), so it is somewhat expected."
21,2004-06-03T18:23:56+00:00,seminole_kev,"I'm just the opposite. I don't care for sunroofs. I've had 'em before, but hardly ever used them, adds cost and weakens the structure of the car. One of the things that turned me off about the Protege 5 back when I was looking (same thing with the Mazda 6 right now) is that if you want side airbags and ABS (yes I do) you have to eat the moonroof and the cost that comes with it. No thanks."
22,2004-06-03T22:36:34+00:00,andys120,"I got as quick glance at a pair of Magnums sitting in front of a local dealer. It looked okay but a bit at odds with itself, IMO. The large trucklike grille didn't quite go with the tapered roofline (cribbed from Audi's Avants).

One was black, the other silver. The black carried the lines better, I thought."
23,2004-06-03T23:20:31+00:00,wale_bate1,"Andy, that's a huge BINGO!

Front and back just don't jibe."
24,2004-06-04T07:08:40+00:00,ghulet,"Dodge's current trend to 'RAM-ify' the front end of all its cars isn't the best idea, IMO. I mean, brand identity is fine and all, but the front of the Magnum is a bit much. Then again, I think their 'target buyer' is male and likely driving a truck or SUV, so I guess they wanted the car to look as macho as possible for a wagon, which I think they accomplished.

Anywho, in the last day, I saw my first Chrysler 300C (black with big chrome wheels, in a dealer's lot) and a Cadillac SLR (??-the new two-seat convertible). Nice looking car, but I almost didn't notice it cuz it looks so much like the CTS except shorter."
25,2004-06-04T11:03:47+00:00,kmag,"I saw a 300 in that vanilla color the other day. I think it looks horrible in that shade, it looks like leftover paint from late 60s Cadillac or something.

Also spied the first Scion XB on the road, it was heading the other way on the freeway so I didnt get too good a look, it was a red-orange color. This car just might be on my short list of used cars to look at in a few years."
26,2004-06-04T16:40:19+00:00,andys120,"for Dodge to introduce a car that has a truck look at a time when gas prices are causing people out of SUVs into more economical vehicles.

Entirely accidental, but good timing. Not that I like the trucky look myself."
27,2004-06-04T20:08:39+00:00,andre1969,"the trucky look of the Magnum. I actually find it to be sleeker looking than the 300C, which is so blunt and blocky looking that it would be at home in a showroom full of Diplomats and Gran Furys. But hey, that's just me!

I hope that the upcoming Charger is more than just a 300 with a Magnum front-end grafted on. But I think I'd prefer a 300 with the Magnum's nose to a 300 with the nose it came with!"

This one was unusual in having no badge on the trunk, I think it was a 530i or 525i 'cuz there were only a single pair of pipes coming out the back and the wheels were no bigger than 16"". That type of debadging is popular in Europe but you don't see it much in the status-conscious USA."

I think I saw the same one again today, because there's no way in hell there would be that many of them in THAT color! It was kind of a putty/beige color with a black top. My old '69 Dart GT hardtop was a color close to that, but had enough chrome on it to set it off better. I think some colors SHOULD just stay in the past!"

I'm also seeing a lot of Cadillac SRXs and, for some reason, Chevy Impalas around here lately. However, the new Chrysler 300 doesn't seem to be that popular in this area. When I was in PA a month ago, I was seeing quite a few of them, but not here.

I just looked at the VW colors on the Edmund's listing, and while the colors there are going to vary from monitor to monitor, I guess, I'd imagine it's what they call ""Harvest Moon Beige"". They have another color listed as simply ""Cream"", so maybe that's the vanilla-looking color? There's a color called ""Sundown Orange"", which might be that pumpkin color. I think it's kinda cool too, and would probably look cool on something retro like a Beetle!"

My Dad told me today 300C's sell to rental fleets. I told him I read that Chrysler is offering very little incentives on 300C's. I saw 2 Chrysler 300C's both with new car tags on them today. I saw a few more 300C's than those 2 I saw today to. I'm like this car is hot and its a Chrysler. Its been a long time since I;ve seen a Chrysler sought after like this.

Also saw alot of Mazda 6 station wagons on my trip to Virgina last weekend(I wonder if Mazda is selling them to rental's or people are buying them as a low budget alternative to an SUV.)

Also seen alot of Mazda 3's(this car may not be as hot as the 300C but its close.) I am a huge Mazda fan and I haven't seen people go crazy over a Mazda product like this ever. I;m like this car is hot but its a Mazda. Usually don't crazy over buying Mazda. People are going crazy over the 3 though.

I guess Andre 1969 should be thrilled at the the way the new Durango and 300C are selling. I think its Chrysler finally is doing something right."

I haven't seen a Magnum in person yet, but I do think the 300/300C look bigger than they really are. Truth be told, they're only about the size of a Taurus or Century, and a bit shorter overall than a LeSabre, Impala, or Intrepid, but they just have that massive, hulking look.

I'm still impressed that, as tall as the cars are, IMO at least, they hide it very well. You'd think a relatively stubby car with a high beltline and smallish windows would look really top-heavy and tipsy, but I don't think they do at all.

I think most of the 300's I've seen so far have been silver! I saw two Magnesium ones though at a dealership in Carlisle PA over the weekend. I'm definitely in lust with them!"

6,2004-06-23T15:19:33+00:00,andys120,"It's what the French call trompe l'oeil. The high-beltline/squashed roofline makes the car look shorter than it is
but somehow the high-waisted Magnum comes off smaller than it is.

That severe taper to the Magnum's roof line n the back takes away a lot of storage space. I have the same thing on my A4 to a lesser degree and it's noticeably smaller in back than the similar Passat.
It's for sure there won't be any third row seating in the back of the Magnum.

Still haven't seen any Goats in these parts. I even swung by a dealership.

I did see a silver CTS-V in front of a dealership, I kinda liked it.

Silver is by far the most common color for the 300/330C but I don't think it's the best, I'm partial to Cool Vanilla. I'm surprised I haven't seen any blues or reds."

I was stunned at how elegant it looked, if a common person saw that they could easily confuse it for a $150K car. What's remarkable is, after comparing it to a prev. generation XJ, how little they had to tweak the exterior styling to get the desired effect. I regret not looking at it better when I bought my LS430, or a Jag might be sitting in my garage right now."
11,2004-06-23T19:30:18+00:00,seminole_kev,"I have to admit to being somewhat biased in favor of Jags, but I really like how ""classy"" the new XJ8 looks compared to others in its class. Now other cars are probably better long term values such as the LS430 and MB S-class, but they just aren't remotely as pretty as the XJ is to me. But again I'm admittedly somewhat biased towards Jags, and in particular, their styling. So my opinion on styling could be a very tiny minority.

*should have added that I think the new XJ really meets up well to Jaguar's old advertisments of ""Grace, Pace, Space""."
12,2004-06-23T19:43:15+00:00,wale_bate1,"Agreed, agreed, agreed!

I see them fairly regularly now, and the aura around them is solid enough to slice with a knife! As a styling statement, it's a superlative.

I also seem to read little but good press as well. It's a bigger car than I'd want, but certainly it's more than beautiful enough, IMO, to desire anyway.

Tough call for me, were I looking in the class, would be between the A8L and the XJ. That would be delightfully unbearable conundrum...

It took a couple of generations and a dozen years for the A8 to be recognized as an equivalent to the S-Class/7-Series/XJ8, even though Audi was already seen as a luxury brand. VW says they understand this

So has GM wisened up and started offering a sunroof, or do y'all think this was an aftermarket job?"
45,2004-07-01T01:37:08+00:00,ghulet,"...you're right, Andre, word had it that the GTO was not offered with a sunroof, either because the roof area is too short in length or because there isn't enough headroom to offer one, I imagine. It seems like domestics have been slow in general to equip their cars with sunroofs, which is kinda sad seeing as how they've been standard or at least frequently so-equipped on most upper end Japanese and Euro cars for the past twenty years or so.

I guess I missed it, but apparently there was a Maybach in front of the house today, and not the blue 57 I saw a few weeks ago (my brother said it was gold, not sure which model). Apparently a friend of our neighbor is a sales rep for them, so we see them once in a while.

I'm also seeing a big increase in 2005 Chrysler 300s around here. There was kind of a delayed response in this area -- I didn't see many when they first came out, but now they are taking off.

One car that is conspicuous in its absence is the 2004 Galant. The 1999-2003 Galant was a hot seller in my region, but the new one seems to have done a face-plant.

0,2004-07-02T00:52:40+00:00,stickguy,"Saw a Scion tC on the road also. Actually, I wil be seeing it a lot, since I bought it. Am curious to know when I will see the first one that doesn't belong to me though!"
1,2004-07-02T01:09:13+00:00,ghulet,"...a maroon Xb, have yet to see an Xa except at the Chicago Auto Show.

The Bangle 5-series is also growing on me, at least the front and back, with their 'cateye' appearance, are cohesive, if nothing else. Still, I parked next to one (a 525i) at Blockbuster today; nice looking, but this one had black paint with plenty of orange peel, puny looking 16"" wheels (said it's come to that, since that was huge ten years ago). Combine that with the smallish back seat, whopping 184hp and massive ~$44k price tag, and I think there are better ways to spend money, y'know? A G35 or TSX and ten or fifteen large, respectively, come to mind."
2,2004-07-02T01:42:14+00:00,andre1969,"the new Galant was on my mind going home from work today. I actually saw two of them on my 3.5 mile trip home, which I think is a record for me!"
3,2004-07-02T13:11:33+00:00,stickguy,"I don't think I have seen a new Galant out on the road. If I did, it certainly didn't make much of an impression."
4,2004-07-02T14:10:51+00:00,andys120,"not the five door hatch...seen in an Enterprise RAC lot. I couldn't tell what it was at firs seeing it from behind. I looked at it harder thinking it appeared to have a 'Yoda emblem on back but was too low a good looking to be a Highlander or Matrix. The tailgate and tailights resembled a Toureg but again, too low to the ground.

Then it hit me--it's the 6 wagon. It's about the size and shape of a B6 A4 Avant, with the same roofline tapering to the rear. Very nice lokking actually."
5,2004-07-02T14:40:28+00:00,lemko,...a black Scion xB traveling south on Roosevelt Blvd. in Philly. It was the first one I've seen on the road.
6,2004-07-02T20:57:30+00:00,vikd,"...I test drove a Mazda6 Wagon about 4 weeks ago; wife is looking to replace her vehicle already. It's one of the nicer looking wagons on the market, imo. With the sport package, its pretty darned entertaining to drive too. The engine is a littel less refined than what I would prefer but it's a decent deal for the money...

7,2004-07-02T21:06:16+00:00,stickguy,"The dealer where I bought my tC had a black Xb that hadn't been prepped yet, that had black steel wheels (no hubcaps). It may have been the single ugliest vehicle I have ever seen. In a different color with the right wheels, I sorta like it though."
8,2004-07-03T21:06:16+00:00,ghulet,"....just went out for breakfast and as I was looking out the window onto Lincoln Avenue, a very pretty blonde got out of a brand new Maserati Cambiocorsa convertible, in a nice looking but subtle blue with light tan interior. I guess the same could be said of the whole car--nice looking, subtle and I'm sure very fast, but just didn't look like a ninety thousand dollar car to me. I also don't imagine it will have the resale value of something more conventional in its price range, like a 911 or SL, though maybe the opposite is true. If nothing else, she certainly won't see herself coming and going in a Maserati."
9,2004-07-07T15:58:32+00:00,seminole_kev,"Saw my first Audi A4 convertible (cabriolet?) on the road yesterday. Sharp, sharp looking car. Lady driving it looked to be, oh....I'd say 120 years old."
10,2004-07-07T16:54:00+00:00,ateixeira,"Coincidentally, yesterday I saw one also. Black, top down. But what's funny is that I was following him, and we passed yet another A4 convertible with the top down. Both black!

12,2004-07-08T17:18:33+00:00,lemko,...A Scion xC coupe - black with alloy wheels. It certainly looks better than the rest of the Scion lineup.
13,2004-07-08T17:30:29+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw just my 2nd ever. These things are just not selling.

Come to think of it, I might have just seen the same one twice!

14,2004-07-08T17:38:16+00:00,lemko,"...geeze, I'm more likely to see a Duesenberg phaeton than a VW Phaeton on the road. The only time I've seen one was on a display stand at the Philly auto show. Too bad. The car would've made a really nice Audi."
15,2004-07-08T17:43:02+00:00,andre1969,"with the name ""Phaeton"" on it, it was a pimped-out Town Car stretch limo!"

17,2004-07-08T18:10:04+00:00,andys120,"Weird! How'd the Phaeton name get attached to these steel roofed cars.

I have seen a couple, one at a dealer, the other in a restaurant parking lot.

OTOH it looks like the Toureg is a big hit for VW. I see them every day now."
18,2004-07-08T19:52:46+00:00,lemko,"...was also used on 1957-58 Mercury hardtops and convertibles. The word ""phaeton"" has become as corrupted as ""roadster"" these days - as in those pimpy ""roadster"" fake convertible roofs on sedans. I recall Ford built cars called ""pillared hardtops"" in the '70s - a contradiction."
19,2004-07-08T20:01:33+00:00,andre1969,"actually, all of the Big Three offered ""pillared hardtops"". GM offered a slim-pillar Electra and Ninetey-Eight 4-door in the mid-late 60's. It had frameless windows, but still had a slim B-pillar.

The '73-77 GM intermediates were referred to as ""Colonade Hardtops"", which was basically just a car with a B-pillar, and frameless windows, even with the 4-doors.

With Ford, they offered ""pillared hardtops"" in full-sized models in '73-78. The earlier, c1969-72 style had them as well, I believe. And the '72-76 and '77-79 midsized Ford sedans and wagons had frameless windows, but a B-pillar.

I think the only Chryslers that were referred to as ""pillared hardtops"" were the 1979-81 R-body Newport, New Yorker/5th Ave, St. Regis, and '80-81 Gran Fury. They even had a different code to denote ""pillared hardtop"" in the VIN code. ""41"" denoted a 4-door sedan, and ""43"" denoted a 4-door hardtop. They came up with ""42"" for the R-body, which denotes ""pillared hardtop"".

The '95-99 Neon also had frameless windows, and I guess you could call it a pillared hardtop. I don't know how to decode modern Mopar VIN #'s though, so I dunno if they actually used a different classification for it or not."
20,2004-07-08T20:02:29+00:00,andre1969,"I know I also saw a '56 Mercury 4-door hardtop with a ""Phaeton"" badge at a car show once. So evidently they used it more than just 2 years."
21,2004-07-08T20:06:29+00:00,ateixeira,"I see plenty of '05 Focii already. They're all over the place. Perhaps the quickest 2005 model launch out there.

23,2004-07-09T02:34:21+00:00,a_l_hubcaps,"Andre-

Those Tauruses are '04s (well, they could be '05s too, I think they recently switched over).

Today I saw an '04 Diamante, with that odd new front-end treatment. It makes a little more sense in reality than in the press photos, but not much more.

Also I saw a Scion xB Release Series (orange paint, custom grille). That certainly catches the eye. It was almost the same color as my brother's '77 Celica.

24,2004-07-09T16:22:15+00:00,wimsey1,"Oddly, I also saw the previous gen 500SL seconds before, around the corner, and then the generation before that 1/ hour later."
25,2004-07-09T17:29:52+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw one of the new drop-tops. Very sharp.

It's neat, also, how they manage without a B-pillar. Much cleaner than the BMW 6's design.

Top down and looking good."
27,2004-07-10T15:21:05+00:00,acura32tltypes,"... silver one at a Toyota dealership. while I appreciate the uniqueness of the xA's and xB's, the tC (IMO) is far more attractive. Fit and finish are excellent inside, and comes standard w/ 17"" wheels. While it is a small coupe, it's a bigger car than photos/images convey - all basing in the mid-16Ks. For the money, this is easily a better buy than the base Celica. This car should be a big sales hit for Scion."
28,2004-07-10T18:04:50+00:00,andys120,"I spotted a special ed xB in that metallic orange.
It might not look good on every car but the colors works well on the xB."
29,2004-07-10T18:40:32+00:00,lemko,"...a black Cadillac XLR travelling west on Rte 63 near Sumneytown, PA. It's the first time I've seen one on the road and in another color than silver. That baby was sharp!!!"
30,2004-07-10T22:19:55+00:00,player4,"Today Cadillac XLR in loke some kinda metallic gold, also saw a Chrysler 300 in black, Chrysler 300 Touring in green, and a Chrysler 300C in dark blue they were alll very nice!!!! Also saw a Scion tC in some kinda dark red."
31,2004-07-10T22:32:20+00:00,fintail,"I saw 4 300s today, all the ""lower"" models with no chrome wheels, and a Magnum"
32,2004-07-11T02:49:55+00:00,ghulet,"...was likely a midrange model, and had a BRA on the front. I thought these ugly things died with the '80s. Yes, they protect from bugs and road rash, but the bra also indelibly stains the paint by trapping dirt and moisture underneath, at least eventually (I know, I peeled the bra off my old '86 SAAB after it had been on for probably ten years and it was a big mess). It's scary that bras are even offered for a brand new model like the 300."
33,2004-07-11T16:42:51+00:00,andys120,those bras have pretty much been supplanted by the 3-M film that's nearly invisibly yet offers good protection against stone chips.
34,2004-07-11T21:10:50+00:00,player4,"today i saw a 2005 Jaguar S-Type in dark red, and aslo saw a 2005 Chrysler 300C with a mesh grille!!"

Same with a Mazda 6 wagon."
36,2004-07-12T17:54:03+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a dark green Phaeton at my pool. And two Touaregs within minutes of each other. So maybe VW owners live near each other? ;-)

39,2004-07-13T00:10:28+00:00,andre1969,"from the all-Mopar nationals at Carlisle PA, and can now say that I've seen more Dodge Magnums than you can shake a stick at. Rode in one too, on a test drive event.

They also had a pre-production model of the Dodge Dakota, in crew cab form, and the new Jeep Grand Cherokee. Both of them look really nice in person. I was really impressed with the way the Dakota's bed was put together. It makes the Colorado look like crap in comparison! The Colorado's bed is pieced together with several different sections that look like they were finished off with roofing tar out of a tube, and then painted over. In contrast, damn if I could see the seams in the Dakota's bed!

The Dak did look a little sloppy around the headlights and taillights though. Hopefully that was just because of it being a pre-production model!

They also had the Charger concept there. Damn they NEED to build that thing!!!"
40,2004-07-13T15:38:14+00:00,wale_bate1,"Which Charger concept? The one from '99-'00, or a new one?

This AM: 645Ci - black/black/black. Came up on its six and from about 100-50 yds back, I thought it was a slammed Eclipse GT! When I got closer, the bustle became more pronounced (flat light this morning), and I recognized it for what it was.

So, from straight on at the back it's not great. From the side is OK; still kind of Sebring-ish to me. Looking in the rearview, I like the front from head-on. Very aggressive and business-like; tough. The rest of the car just doesn't match up.

Still, if someone gave me one..."
41,2004-07-13T15:45:11+00:00,andre1969,"well, it looked like the same Charger concept that's been floating around for awhile now. Kind of a burgundy/maroon color, low slung, and from the rear slightly evokes memories of the '68-70 model. Very sexy...ME WANT!!"
42,2004-07-13T16:17:56+00:00,wale_bate1,"Yeah, that's the '99-'00!

They should've built it. It's a knockout, and unless you knew it was a sedan, you wouldn't know it was a sedan. Genius."
43,2004-07-13T16:19:07+00:00,ateixeira,"I've seen a couple of SSRs on the road, and yeah, they sure do grab attention. It'll be the new cruiser car this summer.

Realistically, an S40 vs 3 comparison, take a base S40 at an MSRP of $23,260, vs the 3s with the ABS/Airbag package at $17,935. So it is only about a $5,300 difference at sticker.

I just spent the past few days at the Delaware shore with some close family friends. They are hosting a 16yr old German exchange student. Anyways, several weeks ago, before he came to U.S. of A., he went on a weekend trip with 2 of his buddies. One of which is 18, legal driving age in Europe. 18 yr old's father had more money than brains and let the 3 teens take his last year made V-8 M5. Now, here's the point of this whole story. They were doing about 120 on Autobahn and they hear this ferocious wailing, coming up fast, on their 6. They moved over and an Enzo went screaming by at least 30 to 40 mph faster than their foot draggin' 120mph.

21,2004-10-04T02:08:07+00:00,a_l_hubcaps,"I took a walk down the Springfield PA ""auto mile"" today. A few comments:

Hyundai Tucson: The interior looked a little disappointing. Obviously I didn't sit in it, but through the windows it looked cheap compared to my mom's Forester and the Mitsu Outlander we test drove recently. The steering wheel and door panels particularly caught my eye as rather cheesy. The exterior styling is nice though -- distinctive without appearing to have been styled by Martians, as is the case with the Santa Fe.

Mercury Montego: The dealer had one of these, in dark red. It was an AWD model with a sticker of almost $29K. It looked pretty nice; the interior was well done and there was nothing ugly or cheap-looking anywhere. I can't help but jump on the ""bland"" bandwagon, though. I mean, even a Camry has certain stylistic elements (the unique taillight shape, the ""hockey stick"" indentation in the door bottoms) that set it apart. If you removed the grille and emblems from the Montego, it would look extremely generic.

Ford Focus: I think the '05 restyle was a major improvement. The elimination of the bizarro dashboard couldn't have come too soon. They should have changed the steering wheel, too, though. It is very weird-looking. Also, the sticker prices on the cars on the lot seemed rather high. Many approached $20K. Maybe Ford needs a cheaper car in this market. Speaking of which...

Chevy Aveo: Just a quick note on the new wheel covers for '05: *RETCH*! The '04 ones looked fine. I don't know why they messed with them. Also, if they're going to offer optional alloys on this car, they ought to come up with a design that doesn't look exactly like a wheel cover. I have been collecting hubcaps for 17 years, and I had to get down on my knees and tap on the wheel to determine that it was aluminum and not a cover. I do like the Aveo though. It seems like a nice car for the price.

Think of it as more a replacement for those old tall Civic wagons, or maybe the continuation of the first-gen Odyssey/Oasis, which was really more wagon than minivan.

I like it, though. The proportioning is lower and wider than the typical minivan, and the ratio of headlight-to-grille-width is just about perfect, IMO. Nice ""floating"" effect with the horizontal grille bars inset in the trapezoid, and it's nice to see some chrome (plastic or otherwise) tastefully done on a vehicle!"

32,2004-10-06T21:01:17+00:00,stickguy,"SOrt of, but what they do is make 7 positions as fake ""gears"", to give the impression of of stepped transmission. I think Audi does this also. Not sure if it will run them automatically, or only when you are using the Tiptronic feature.

It takes a long time to wean people off what they are used to, no matter how effective the technology is. The CVT is a bit different at first, only because you are expecting one sensation and get another."

That STS was pretty sweet, almost made me want one."
40,2004-10-12T03:00:40+00:00,scscars,"I also saw a new STS this weekend. It was being shown at a shopping mall north of Chicago. The fit and finish is better than the Seville, but I must admit, I've never driven the last version of the Seville. The interior is a step up from Devilles. The wood is real this time. According to the sales person, wood accents are eucalyptus--light or dark. This particular car, dark gray with gray leather interior, had dark eucalyptus dash and console trim. While this car bears a resemblance to the CTS, it is longer, wider, and has more street presence. For $50,000, it better have some street presence.

Also saw a new Mercury Montego yesterday, and got a good look at the inside and outside of it. Yes, its a rebadged Five Hundred, however, the interior seems lots more upscale. This one was black with gray leather and beige(?) cloth upholstery. Rear seat room looks bigger than Sable, but not huge. The overall interior design makes more sense than Sable or Taurus and it reminds me of an Audi A6.

Unfortunately, a Montego won't perform like an A6. This particular Montego was saddled with a Duratec 3.0L cranking out 203 HP. If Ford were really remotely serious about competing with Passats, V6 Accords, Camrys, Altimas and the like, they would have taken the 220 HP 3.0L from the Mazda6 and made it available in the Montego and Five Hundred."

Also, isn't that a good way for the new model to get more exposure? Just as long as they're not dumping every blessed one they produce into rental fleets!"
45,2004-10-16T01:20:25+00:00,fintail,I saw a black SSR on the road today. First one I've seen being driven and not hogging up space on a lot full of cars that barely sell (relative to the amounts that the dealers take in) anyway.
46,2004-10-17T05:41:28+00:00,a_l_hubcaps,"I don't think it was ever the case that the Malibu was not going to be sold to fleets at all. They are just trying to keep the percentage down. In fact, if you look at the GM ordering guides, there is a special fleet-only package slotted between the base and LS models (equipped like a base, but with a V6 and 16"" wheels). That has existed since day 1.

Eventually, they are going to have to phase out the Classic -- it's a creaky old platform and more upscale fleets don't want it. It was just a stopgap measure to keep the Malibus from flooding into the fleets immediately. They are doing the same thing with the Grand Am as the G6 comes out.

By the way, it will be interesting to see who's the loser in this game of fleet-sale reductions. Every company seems to want to reduce fleet sales, but fleet is sort of a fixed demand -- they aren't going to buy fewer cars just because GM, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsu, Suzuki, Toyota etc. don't want to sell them.

Volvo S40looking much nicer on the street than in a showroom or auto show booth. Very similar in size and style to it's big brother, the S60. It looked good in a trendy medium grey/dark silver.

Audi TT 3.2 Cabrio in a seasonally appropriate Pumpkin Orange. The color was a bit much but I can tell you these things are a blast to drive with their DSG gearboxes."

Actually, it seems like the hump backed hatchs just don't make good convertibles. Too rumpish, and the top looks like an old Merc chop job.

I don't like the new Max at all though. It's like they took the Altima apart and put it back together wrong, or something! But then the Altima is one car I really like. I liked it when it was redone for '02, and I think the '05 refresh makes it look even nicer.

I don't think I've liked the Sentra since those old, slightly wedge-shaped models from the first half of the 90's, the ones that were faintly evocative of a BMW 3-series (or the old 2002)"

Bland is also the word I'd use to describe those '89-'95 Maxs. There's no finesse to the detailing in or out or surface excitement to draw the eye IMHO.

The '96-'03 models with sportier headlights and bigger grilles appealed to me more and Andre's comment on the '04 is right on"
28,2004-10-28T21:20:42+00:00,ghulet,"The new one is at least visually interesting, if not exactly attractive. The rear end treatment is a bit scary, the backlight is too small. I really think they tarted it up a bit too much, it's just too flashy.

I don't, in general, understand some of Nissan's decisions of late. Since the Altima is now available with up to 260hp to the Max's 265, I'd think they would have made the Maxima RWD, not only to quell the torque steer, but to distinguish it from the Altima, which is now a bit too similar in size, and when fully loaded, in price. I also don't get the SkyRoof in the Max and Quest. I mean, who wants a full-length, non-opening glass panel in their roof? It's like driving a terrarium. They also need to do a redesign on the Sentra, pronto. That car is ugly and basically non-competitive right now, except maybe if you can get one at a steep discount. I can't remember the last time I even saw one."
29,2004-10-29T00:45:38+00:00,kyfdx,"The whole Nissan styling thing amazes me... Really, the Titan is about the only thing they have that looks decent.. They even did a better job on the Infiniti G35 coupe, than the 350Z.

They might be decent cars, but I just can't get past the styling.. and in general, I'm usually more concerned with how cars drive than how they look... My standards for beauty aren't that high, but Nissans have ""last call"" looks.. I just don't want to wake up in the morning and see one in my garage."

I don't think most people would notice that when driving However, the wheelbase is up about 6"", to 107.1"", from 101.3"", which might make some people take notice. However, the turning circle is actually down, from a Caprice-like 38.7 feet to 36 feet. And weight looks like it's up around 100 lb, which given the current trends in cars, probably isn't too bad. The old Stand was definitely a twister anyway, especially in convertible form, so the new body is most likely much stiffer."
11,2004-11-11T03:59:27+00:00,scscars,"Thanks for the clarification on the '05 Mustang. Like Andys120, I thought that the new Mustang would be bloated like the '71-'73 models, since it was to be built on the same platform as the Lincoln LS, Thunderbird, and Jaguar S-Type (DEW98 platform). In the end, Ford opted to give Mustang its own platform and the result looks like it turned out fine. The '05 does not look to be as large as the S-Type or boxy like the LS.

Andre, you are correct about the body being a lot stiffer. I've been reading that Ford stiffened the body to reduce NVH, and to provide a more solid structure for the 300 HP 4.6L in the GT which has 320 foot/pounds of torque."

The new Frontier will be a slightly downsized Titan, the Dakota has always been a big truck and I'm sure the Ranger will grow in its next iteration.

19,2004-11-21T17:40:44+00:00,a_l_hubcaps,"I took a walk through some dealership lots this morning, and saw the following:

2005 Chevy Cobalt: The dealer had 2 on the lot, both base sedans. There were also a bunch of 2005 Cavaliers for comparison. The Cobalt definitely had a tighter build quality to it. In styling, it was a toss-up...IMHO, the Cobalt has a nicer front and the Cavalier has a nicer rear. The Cobalt interior looked good and lacked the shapeless '90s look of the Cavalier. The base interior looks plainer than the uplevel one that was shown in the press photos, but it's perfectly acceptable for a $15-16K car, which is where the stickers were on the two I looked at.

Cadillac STS: This thing looks BIG, which in my opinion is a good thing. The old Seville/STS always looked too slim and ""flattened"" to me. The interior is obviously very nice, though I thought the Caddy emblem on the steering wheel looked cheap...it's just a sticker.

Mercury Montego: They had only one on the lot, and it looked very nice inside and out for a car with a $26K sticker. I would have believed $32K. I think Ford has finally noticed that, if they price cars competetively to start, they don't need $5000 rebates.

Chevy Malibu: I just thought I'd comment that the Chevy place had two long rows of 2004 Malibus still on the lot! Maybe people think they are overpriced or something. They seem like nice enough cars. The same place had sold out of 2004 Impalas and Cavaliers, so it's not like their overall sales were just slow.

Saturn RELAY, Pontiac Montana SV6: I actually saw the RELAY on the road, not at a dealership, so I didn't get a close look at it. Both of these vans look BIG. If they are trying to appeal to large-SUV buyers who don't like ""wimpy"" vans, this should do it. The SV6 I saw was a loaded model with a sticker around $32K. The interior looked much, much better than the old GM vans. The RELAY I saw was a standard 2 model. It had black bumpers, which looked a little cheap, though they are nice for city parking because they don't start peeling as soon as the paint cracks.

Of course, its purpose is mainly city driving. And, considering how many Navigators and other ""buses"" I see on the roads in the city, rarely carrying more than the driver and a cellphone.... I think that this kind of transportation should be strongly encouraged by the governments (incentives and so on). Not to mention that it consumes almost nothing (about 4L/100km - with a tank of, say, 30L you'd go almost 800km - if you drive, say, 50km in average perday, you'd have to fill it every two weeks, at a cost of less than 12$)"

VW Gol (not Golf, Gol), Voyage, Parati, and Saveiro (pickup).

21,2005-01-26T16:05:24+00:00,Kirstie_H,"I haven't decided. Interestingly, as I was following this car (the new NEW Jetta), it pulled up alongside a Jetta of the same color, but an older model (the old NEW Jetta). The new Jetta appeared somewhat larger, and the back end is definitely reminiscint of recent Toyota styling (See: Camry, Corolla).

 

I had a 2000 VR6, and I was a fan of the square-ish styling. So, initially, it's not my cup of tea. But if it's as fun to drive as earlier versions, I could forgive the change.

 

I guess I don't want to be one of these people who believes that a model should look like it's always looked. I want to be open to letting change grow on me.

The cls was a wood mock up (same one thay had at the show BTW)so I couldn't get in it but I think it looks odd, especially in the forest green they had... yuck. I worry as well about stretching your customer base too thin along too many product line extensions. Does anyone really need something between an E and an S?

That's the Pontiac Aveo. Somehow, there have always been lower model Pontiacs in Canada. Another oddball that comes to mind is the Corsica-based Tempest. And the Sunfire always seemed to do well, even in it's ghastly later facelift. Maybe for the US Pontiac is supposed to be a higher brand, instead of a sporty Chevy as it used to be."
17,2005-03-30T16:05:43+00:00,davem2001,"Well, I can understand not having the Corsica based Tempest, since the Corsica was basically the same as a Grand Am in size, price, etc......but, I'm not quite sure why they don't sell some of those other ""badge engineered"" Chevys (or Daewoo in the Aveo's case) in the USA? I always thought of Pontiac as somewhat of a 'youth' brand, so why not have some entry level cars?"
18,2005-03-30T16:23:18+00:00,andre1969,"was always a bit funny because of the dealer network up there. Instead of having standalone Chevy, Pontiac, Buick, and Olds dealers like what used to be the norm in the US before GM started to decline, in Canada they paired Chevy up with Buick (or was it Olds?) Well, whichever one got paired up with Chevrolet, Pontiac got paired up with the other.

As a result, Pontiac became more of a clone of Chevy, rather than a step up. And in many ways it became like Plymouth, which could never get too upscale for fear of stealing the thunder from the Chryslers they shared the showroom floor with.

Most of the smaller Canadian Pontiacs were just clones of Chevies, with slightly different grilles meant to suggest a Pontiac. For example, a Pontiac Beaumont was a Chevy Chevelle with a Pontiac-ish looking grille. But it had a Chevy interior and sheetmetal, and not Tempest/LeMans sheetmetal/interior.

Where it got weird though was with the full-sized Pontiacs. They used Chevy engines and the shorter Chevy wheelbase, but then used Pontiac interiors and sheetmetal. So a 1969 Canadian Pontiac Parisienne actually looked like a 1969 US Pontiac Bonneville at a quick glance, but overall rode a wheelbase 6 inches shorter, and was about 10 inches shorter overall.

At some point though, they started importing the ""real"" Pontiacs like the Catalina and Bonneville to Canada, to sell alongside the home grown models. And by the time downsizing hit in 1977, it eliminated any differences in wheelbase between a Chevy and Pontiac anyway, so the cars became much more similar, although I think they were using Chevy 250's, 305's and 350's instead of Pontiac 301's, 350's, and 400's."

The Corsica/Beretta were the L platform - first came out in 1987/88."
26,2005-03-31T15:40:33+00:00,andre1969,"They actually went through the effort to rename the Corsica/Beretta as the ""L"" body? It was the same underneath as the N-body. But GM did things like that. Back in the 80's, the only real difference between the FWD C- and H-body was that the C- had a more upright C-pillar and the back seat was further back, giving it more rear legroom, but a bit less trunk space. The Seville from 1980 onward was just a 4-door Eldorado/Toro/Riv, but it carried a different designation...""K"", versus ""E"".

The N-body was actually derived from the J-body (Cavalier, et al), riding a slightly longer wheelbase (103.4"" versus 101.2""), and being about 5-6"" longer, overall. They were originally released only as 2-doors, which might seem odd, but GM's reasoning for that made sense, at least a few years earlier. Back when these cars were first being designed, everyone was afraid that $3.00 per gallon fuel was going to be the norm, and even the radically downsized late 70's era GM cars were still too big.

Believe it or not, these N-bodies were originally slated to replace the RWD Regal, Cutlass Supreme, Grand Prix, and Monte Carlo! In fact, if you notice, the 3 N-bodies that were released for '85 were named after high-spec versions of the GM RWD coupes. Somerset and Calais were originally sporty versions of the Regal and Cutlass Supreme. They didn't have bigger engines or more hp, but usually had bucket seats, floor shifts, t-tops, alloy/rallye wheels, etc. And the Grand Am was one of Pontiac's last attempts at a muscle car (the '73-75 moreso than the '78-80) Once fuel prices eased off and the gas was flowing again, GM held off on axing the RWD coupes, and instead tried to pit these things as something of a BMW fighter, an upscale compact. And with the X-body being pulled after 1984 (Omega/Phoenix) and '1985 (Citation/Skylark), that was going to leave GM without a compact 4-door, so 4-door N-bodies were released for '86.

The X-body was the basis of the FWD A-body (Celebrity/6000/Century/Cutlass Ciera), which lasted from '82-96, and probably would have gone on longer if more stringent side impact standards weren't looming in the near future."

30,2005-03-31T17:01:14+00:00,davem2001,"Yep - those cars were designed with the thought that gas would be $2, $3 a gallon - they were meant to replace the RWD Grand Prix, Cutlass, Regal...

Same as the Eldorado, Toronado, and Rivera that came out around the same timeframe (MY 86)...they were all built on the premise that gas prices would be sky high."
31,2005-03-31T17:31:33+00:00,andre1969,"that GM couldn't have given the E/K body a reprieve, once they figured out that gas prices were going up. As it was, I think the '85 Riv, Toro, Eldo, and even Seville hit record, or near-record sales, as people realized this would be their last chance to get a big 'un. That should have been a hint to GM right there.

But then again, maybe not. IIRC, sales of the mammoth '76 Ninety Eight and Electra hit record, or near record sales, as people rushed to buy the last of the big ones. But when the small '77's hit the market, sales soared to even loftier heights.

Eventually, the E/K body would have to have been redesigned, but I'm sure they could have gotten at least a few more good years out of it. And once GM started getting a bit more serious with its engines, such as improving the 3.8 V-6, and ditching the Caddy 4.1 for the more reliable 4.5 and 4.9, performance of these cars would have improved."
32,2005-03-31T18:15:33+00:00,davem2001,"Well, again, as we always say, GM is too slow to react... if they could move more quickly, yeah, they could have just scrapped or delayed the '86 E/K and kept on building the old ones for another 3,4 years... Just like they kept on building the old RWD ""A"" sedans (Pontiac Bonnevile, Buick Regal, etc..) they just renamed them ""G"" when the FWD ""A"" came out. It would have been cheaper and more profitable for them just to keep on building the '79-'85 E for a few more years..."

21,2005-04-13T18:21:25+00:00,andre1969,"but I got a chance to ride in a PT Cruiser convertible today. I was walking out during lunchtime to go to the bank and get something to eat, when I see one of my friends parked out in front of the building. His daughter works in my building, and he used to work here, too. Well, he normally has a silver 300C, but it had to go in the shop because of some sensor that needed to be replaced. This convertible was his loaner.

One thing I'll say for it, is that it's actually a nice little car. I can fit in it, both front and back, and it has a nice, high, 40's/early-mid 50's seating position. It's a decent little 4-seater. One thing I don't like about it though, is that in the back my head is actually higher than the ""basket handle"" roll bar! It's annoying because it lines up roughly with my eyesight, but it also makes me wonder how much good this thing would do me in a rollover! Overall though, I do like the open, airy feeling you get with the top down. Kinda like an old convertible. One thing I don't like about some of the current convertibles is that you sit so low, and the beltline is so high, with a windshield that curves back almost over top of you, that even with the top down, I still feel like I'm inside. With the PT and it's relatively upright windshield and high seating position, I don't get that feeling.

It was a silver GT model with leather, turbo, etc, and a sticker price of around $29,700. Lots of hard plastic inside, and not a whole lot of soft-touch stuff, but it made me think of a subject that comes up in these forums from time to time, about ""plastic is plastic"". Well, it's not. This interior was kind of an off-white/creme/pearl color, and I thought it looked nice. The hard plastic has kind of an ""elephant grain"" to its texture, similar to the hard plastic in my Intrepid. I thought it was pleasing to the eye, if not to the touch.

One thing I thought was a bit odd, though...every time I got in this car, I'd forget to put my seatbelt on! And usually that's a reflex for me! You'd think that, getting in a convertible with the top down, putting the seatbelt on would be the FIRST thing on my mind!"

24,2005-05-01T08:06:10+00:00,ghulet,"....just bought a ML350, looks OK, but definitely looks smaller than the last ML (back is definitely more sloped), and way too much like a Kia Sorento (which, admittedly, was a shameless copy of the original ML). I guess I feel the same about the new ML as I do about the newest CLK and E-class--they just don't look as 'substantial' or something, I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe Mercedes strive to make their cars look 'sleek' is making them look too low or too small, I'm not sure, but I don't think it's the best idea. In comparison to other cars, they don't look as special any more, and not like they should cost $50k. Of course, now that Buick LaCrosses, Avalons and Chrysler 300s can have $38k MSRPs, I guess $50k isn't such a big deal any more. :surprise:"
25,2005-05-01T13:16:19+00:00,merc1,"Very interesting point. I've said the same thing every since the 2003 E and CLK were first shown. They're ""prettier"" than the cars they replaced, but a little less distinctive. Then I get a look at older Mercedes and see how upright their winshields/A-pillars are an I'm like that thing was a good looking ""box"" back in the day. Older Mercedes were ""cleaner"" in design. Upright, less cutlines and more broad expanses of sheetmetal and very, very subtle ""character"" lines. The direct opposite of what the new SLK has running down its side for instance. Now the CLS is ""clean"" like Mercedes of old, but its far swoopier. If you look at the current SL for example, way too many cut lines and little nicks on the body for various styling elements like vents etc. Then look at the R129 SL. Clean block styling that is timeless and sturdy, but the new car is sleeker and ""prettier"".

Of course I like the way these newer Mercedes' look, but I clearly see that they aren't as distinctive as before. Thats seems to be the price of change. Wait until the new S-Class appears. The front end has to pass those Euro pedestrian safety standards which is going to kill that sloping hoodline Mercedes has been using for the last few years.

As you noted one of the biggest negatives about Korea's shamless copying is that the origial isn't free to evolve anymore. The new Lexus GS and Maxima are another example. Lexus had the look first back in 1998, then came the 2004 Maxima with from the rear, especially the rear glass treatment is pure 1998 GS. Now the new 2006 GS unfortunately looks like a Maxima. The Koreans are more bent on copying than the Japanese ever were imo. This new Sonata is pure Honda Accord from the rear and collection of various cars everywhere else. Oh well.

I finally saw my first new style Corvette today"

That and the Volvo XC seem to be the vehicles-du-jour among our local nouveau riche townhouse dwellers. I also saw my first new Vette today, what a coincidence (and it was parked in the lot at the county court building at 26th/California!). It was a red coupe with chrome wheels, very nice.

Did Ford just make one as a marketing tool or are they actually selling these things? I don't think the american auto companies get the mass market appeal of these yet. Don't just make small weird looking compact hybrids as some sort of honda insightesque curiosity... Make a hybrid version of normal useful cars that people drive anyway. Look how many rx400h's Toyota has already booked, if they had a hybrid tahoe, or explorer they could do the same. Honda seems to have made a hybrid sportier than their regular accord. Who wouldn't want to see that torquey 240 hp v6 in the new sky/solstice body or a Mustang that got 30+ mpg. This is a no brainer to me. I am waiting for the powerful hybrid Subaru wagon which will be the greatest vehicle ever known to man ( in my opinion)"
44,2005-05-03T15:57:31+00:00,davem2001,"I've seen an Escape Hybrid parked at the local Ford dealer that I pass every day going to work, but I haven't seen one on the road yet."
45,2005-05-03T15:58:13+00:00,ateixeira,"I nominate the Forester (non-turbo) as a good candidate.

Why? Because it already gets 22/30 with automatic, 23/30 with manual.

The RX400H and Highlander hybrids only get 26-27 mpg highway, so the Forester could outpace those by far.

The Escape hybrid is a lot heavier and the 2.3l engine struggles to move all that weight. Subaru's 2.5l is both stronger and more efficient plus it's pulling a lighter vehicle.

Hence the perfect candidate. It would easily be the most fuel efficient SUV, it almost is now even without the hybrid powertrain.

4,2005-05-06T15:57:53+00:00,teds1,"I saw one off those Mercury Ford 500s today on my way to work... I don't get it what's the point? Car companies think they are being clever by re-badging the same car but if you have to market the same vehicle with a different grill twice where are the cost savings? Nobody thinks a Mariner is different from an Escape, or a Mountaineer is different from an Explorer. The brands don't mean nearly as much as in the 50's when everyone's dad was a ""Plymouth man,"" or and ""Oldsmobile man."" When you re-badge the same platform it dilutes any brand identity these dinosaur marques may have had. What matters today is the vehicle. Look at the success of Mazda and Subaru recently. Ford even uses the Mazda 6 platform extensively in it's lines, and twenty years ago those brands had completely different images. So please American large car companies, either make different models for different brands, or lose the brands."
5,2005-05-06T16:51:34+00:00,ateixeira,"Well, Saab sells the 9-2x, a Subaru clone.

Subaru has not yet sold clones in the US, but in Europe they sold a Justy (Suzuki Swift clone) and in Japan they sold a Traviq (Open Zafira clone).

Often it's just economics. Dealers are very powerful and they want a full line of cars to sell, so they have to come up with something cheap/quick to please the dealer.

-juice"
6,2005-05-06T19:32:47+00:00,teds1,"Understood, but with the exception of the 9-2x (don't get me started on that thing!) you are talking about different geographical regions. It is one thing to market a car under a different nameplate in another country, but I feel that this is different from why Ford has it's Mercury division. Mercury does not have one unique product . They are all Ford clones. So why keep the separate brand? I don't think the dealer power is an issue here because almost all the Ford dealers I have seen are also Mercury dealers. I am against killing off historical brands and nameplates because there is still tremendous name recognition involved to say nothing of history. But they should have separate vehicles to maintain an identity. I'm not even talking about platform sharing which is fine. However when you produce two 500s and slap a different grill and badging on one for sale in the same dealership in the same country, you have to wonder why."
7,2005-05-06T20:07:07+00:00,ateixeira,"Well, Cougar was unique, and look how much good that did them!

They took that risk and got bitten hard, maybe now they are gun-shy.

Around here, Ford dealers stand alone. Mercury dealer partner with Lincoln.

I thought Mercury should sell the Ford of Europe vehicles, like the Mondeo and maybe the Fiesta. Or make the Fiesta a Ford and let Mercury sell the new Focus.

Also my first 2005 Avalon in white color. Looks better in person than in the pictures."
9,2005-05-09T01:13:36+00:00,fintail,"I didn't see too many new things on my little trip. I did see a couple new ML, and quite a few Cobalts are showing up....mostly sedans. I hope it's a good sign, they do look like a decent enough car. I saw several G6 too, but something tells me they were rentals. They all looked kinda basic. The new Avalons are starting to really move up here too, I saw maybe half a dozen of them."

One oddity about it is that the key for the trunk is inserted vertically into a keyhole in the license plate area. I guess with remotes, most people don't use it so it eliminates it as a styling element.

Actually figured out that it was the one car I couldn't identify at a market research thing I attended here in San Diego back around February. (The cars had all badging covered, but the other ones I looked at were the current Maxima, ES330, Chysler 300, Buick LaCrosse, and a 5-series.)

I also saw a new Lexus GS on Saturday morning.

I've seen a half dozen Elises on the street around here. I can remember Yellow, Blue, Silver, and Orange."

They had a Buick Lacrosse and a Silverado SS. The Lacrosse actually is better looking in person - seems more compact and athletic than I've seen in the pics.

It's funny, I seem to like the old looks of the BMW 3,5,7 series better than the new ones. Well, the 7 has been out for a while, I'm getting used to it, even liking it a bit. But the 5? No way, looks uglier than any other car in it's class. The 3 series isn't too bad, I guess I'll get used to it.

We get a lot of European brands that the US doesn not get like Peugeot, Citroen Renault and Seat. We also get the Mercedes A Class, not available in the States.

And we also have Japanese brands like Nissan, Toyota ,Lexus, and Honda. Infiniti is starting to make an appearance here with the FX45, QX56 and G35 coupe. Acura is non existent here.

We have American brands, but only Chevrolet GMC and Cadillac. No Pontiac, Buick or Saturn. Lincoln only sells the Town Car and LS, no SUVs.

The disadvantage to living here is that vehicles debut much later than in America. The Nissan Armada is just arriving, and the 2002 Camry arrived as 2003 model here. The Ford Mustang just made it's debut. Also, the 7 seater Pathfinder hasn't made it's way here yet.

If you think the Nissan Armada is a super-sized Rambler Croos Country, you should see what the most popular full size SUV here is - GMC Yukon/Chevrolet Tahoe. These two aren't as big as the Armada, but the Suburban is, and it is extremely popular. You can find all model years here, even the ancient ones. We once had an idiot in a 1980's Suburban tailgating on us in the fast lane at 120km/h

I actually like seeing the Nissan Armada. I didn't like it's styling in the pictures, but it looks better in person, and it is a welcome change from the monotone of the GM full size SUV's and pickups.

Also, GM full size trucks own the full size market here. Spotting a Ram is rare, unless it is tricked out or a Rumble Bee version. F-150's are just springing up. But there is no doubt - the Silverado/Sierra are the most common work trucks."

Nice car, a definite improvement over the outgoing version, but still doesn't quite look as 'expensive' or exclusive as Mercedes used to. I'm also not too fond of the pointy beaks and multiple character lines on the newest sporty Benzes. It's probably just me, my perceptions of cars are stuck in the '80s or something. I did notice it was wearing wheels nearly identical to those on the highest-spec Chrysler Crossfire (the million-spoke alloys that are a real pain to clean).

I also saw a new Lincoln Zephyr; looked nice enough from most angles (though it's small, definitely smaller than an Accord or Camry, and likely more expensive), except the taillight treatment is a bit awkward.

Edit: Here's a Brazilian version, actually looks surprisingly butch. These are tiny, much smaller than the current Ranger, but something more the size of a Jetta wagon would probably work here.

VW might as well give it a try. They need something to liven up the brand.

From what I have read, it is a very nice driving and comfortable unit. Also seems to be a good value (at least if you stay away from the techno stuff). I just think Sube went too far making it distinctive. Have to imagine that they could keep the basic shape while cleaning up the nose and tail a bit, and sell quite a few more.

Normally the suburbs aren't that great for car-spotting but I saw a new 3-series (the back is ugly... I actually prefer the 7-series, ive gotten used to it), a new Jaguar S-Type and a bright green (not British racing) MG ZT (based on the Rover 75)

Let's not forget downtown, where I saw a new Nissan 350Z (why do people always buy it in silver?) behind an Alfa Romeo GT (back looks too boxy)

Otherwise, nothing special, as usual."

What's happened to MG Rover exactly? The Longbridge plant was shut down... but the company isn't dead is it?

MG Rover finally came to Australia, like, this year. The last time they were here, around the same time 'Sterling' was in the states, they had the 800 (Sterling/Vitesse) and the 416i (rebadged Honda Integra 4-dr... don't ask me why) and they left for some reason, probably finanical troubles. Now they come back with a decent line-up of cars and so of course the mothership has to have engine troubles. They'll probably leave Aus again.

Such a shame, I saw a beautiful MG ZS in dark-light grey at the most recent motor show. A little bit cramped inside, but it more than made up for it. I hear it drives pretty good too, at least better than the Rover 45 its based on."

But today I some pretty neat cars, starting with a blue Mini Cooper Convertible, a red C6 Corvette convertible, a white Mustang, a silver Porsche 911 Carrera and two Lexus GS300s.

Also saw a pearl white Lexus SC430 on some nice rims, and a white Hummer limo that was incredibly long.

My only criticism would be of the overly bust rump of the car where four round tailights compete for a small space with a oversized chrome letters spelling out L-O-T-U-S.

I think Hyundai will need about ten years of Honda-like reports to sway me towards it... The price advantage isn't as large as it used to be...

And consumers said ""OK"" and continued to buy Camry and Accords.

Maserati Quattroporte, charcoal gray with saddle tan interior, sitting in a valet lot in the Loop on a weekday

Maserati coupe (can't remember the name), also gray with tan interior, really didn't look too special, parked on Dearborn (I don't know if I could park a $100k car on the street if I had one; it's probably a good thing I don't, eh?)"

Not much in Ireland but in London I saw probably a dozen Bentley GT's a few hot looking TVR's, Aston Martin's (my faves) aplenty. Peugot, Ford, MB own the market there, literally. They are everywhere, especially the Benzes... Toyota is pretty popular with the Avensis, Audi has a strong prescence and BMW does pretty well. But on the outskirts of London (we took a tour bus out of town) every other vehicle was a Vauxhal Vectra or Ford Mondeo. BTW, there is a Mondeo ST220 which is smokin hot, really nice car. I even caught a gorgeous '67 Mustang Fastback in Blue driving by B. Palace. There were a few Citroen's, Honda Accords (TSX) and CRV's and Mini's are very popular. All in all, London a was pretty cool place to see cars that we don't get here in the states

Side note, we rented a Toyota Avensis 4D4 (2.0 diesel) with a stick and I was quite impressed. Plenty of pep moving such a big car around and it returned 53 mpg!!! I am totally sold on the idea of diesels, this one was excellent. Had a little bit of Diesel patter on idle, but moving along it was unobtrusive and very smooth in operation. And the Avensis itself was a pretty nice vehicle IMO. A bit too much vehicle for the tiny Ireland roads, but a comfortable cruiser (when you could)."

Then at my dentist's building there was an Aston Martin DB9 which apparently belongs to the building's owner. However the car was under a cover so I didn't get a good look. There was also a black Range Rover and black 745Li.

Then parked nearby the building was a pearl white SC430 with some very nice, and large chrome DUBS.

But the best part of today was yet to come. There's a car dealership that specializes in fancy cars across the street from the dentist. Usually they have FX45s, Escalades, H2s, but today they had a long, red American looking car, probably from the 60s or so. I could not recognize it. There was also what looked like a black Rolls Royce from the 50s.

But amidst it all, I spotted a white Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R!!!!! This car is so damn rare! I went to Singapore recently, and spotted a grey one there, but it was a sedan. This was the first time I've seen the R34 GT-R! It had some nice yellow brake calipers.

On the way home I spotted an orange Range Rover Sport, and it looks very nice.

The on the highway, traffic slowed. When it picked up again I noticed three almost unrecognizable wrecks on the side of the road. One was a white Maxima, and a white 5 series, and there was an unrecognizable white SUV, probably a Patrol. Those were crumpled so bad it was unreal.

I am usually not a fan of cosmetic aftermarket add ons but this actually does seem to improve the look of the car. I know the standard grill heralds back to the original 300 cars but it is one of the worst features IMO on the car.

36,2005-09-28T23:56:34+00:00,andys120,"all seen for the first time today:

-Hummer H3: honey, they shrunk the SUV and it worked!

-Audi A6, big mouth

-Mitsu Eclipse, seen from a distance-looks nice from the side. It was a trendy metallic orange."

38,2005-09-29T13:30:20+00:00,stickguy,"1st ones in the area. It was at the dealer Got to drive one too. Haven't seen one on the raod though, but expect to see a lot soon."
39,2005-09-29T13:51:17+00:00,navigator89,"a maroon Hyundai Sonata, a silver Range Rover Spor and a beige Grand Vitara.

And when passing a car dealer I saw a white Nissan Skyline R34 GTR as well as a black Mitsubishi Evo. Both are absolutely stunning cars.

Also a red Ferrari, which was darker than Maranello red but lighter than maroon.

And when driving by a house, I saw what was either a 2007 Mercedes S Class or a Maybach 57, because I only saw the rear, which is very similar. Since the S isn't really out yet I assume it was the 57, my first.

And finally, a silver Maserati Quattroporte. A stunning car to say the least."
40,2005-09-29T14:55:50+00:00,teds1,"All I have to say is that my mother has a beetle (new style) and it's the most unreliable piece of crap car I have ever seen. It has 48K and problems you woudl expect from a 150k vehicle. The check oil light has been on for a year, no one can figure out why. The check engine light has gone off regularly for serious issues. We just replaced the AC system, the bracket which allows the seat to go forward broke so in an accident the whole seat would have flipped forward, the ground clearance is minimal and we have ripped off the plastic cladding on the bottom on regular roads a few times. The engine screams at 4500 rpm in 5th on the highway at 75 mph, the milage isn't good and the rear headroom is non existent.... Thank god it's a 5 speed or I might push it off a cliff.

My point being that I agree, VW has had some serious quality issues in their cars since about 97. Phaetons are cool though, I like them a lot, soooo stealth, beautiful interior. I like the idea of W engines but they are rather unproven in passenger vehicles, obviously they do fine on a race track."

I also saw a 2006 Accord on my way home from work last night. The rear really looks good in person now, I almost thought it was a coupe until I realized it was the 2006 refresh. There is also a new, albeit 2005 Accord Hybrid in the parking lot as well."
44,2005-09-30T14:11:29+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw an Impala going home yesterday, and I was following an STS coming in.

45,2005-09-30T18:04:19+00:00,clarencehollow,"I spotted a new Hummer H3 the other day. I drove behind one today. It reminds me of the Jeep Cherokee. I found out it's actually nothing more than a re-bodied Chevrolet Colorado with the same engine, the 5 cylinder. I just don't like it, and if I wanted to spend that kind of money I would get a real SUV - the Chevy Tahoe - 2007 to be exact."
46,2005-10-01T23:38:47+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw an H3 in my friend's Town House development.

Then I saw a Lincoln Mark LT, first I've seen in person.

Then I saw something really freaky, it had a Benz logo, but it was a van. At first I thought it was an A-class, but it was bigger. I got closer and read the label - Vaneo on one side, 1.9 on the other, it said. I'd never even heard of that. Had diplomatic plates, so surely it's a european car.

Also saw a Tucson and a Sonata.

47,2005-10-02T19:47:02+00:00,navigator89,"several Hyundai Tucsons since they came out. I see more of them than the Sportage. Of all the 2005 models out, I see Uplanders and Tucsons the most.

Spotted two Sonata today on the highway, one in silver and the other in black. Also was behind the 2006 BMW 750Li. The back looks nice now that's its cleaned up. Then a dark green new Odyssey.

Finally a white previous generation Pathfinder on dubs."

2,2005-10-03T18:43:00+00:00,andys120,"FYI it's xA, and xB for the boxy Echo/Yaris-based Scions. I'm surprised they aren't sold in Canada considering it's more small-car friendly than the USA."
3,2005-10-03T18:45:22+00:00,jaserb,"I saw one too, also at the dealer, in a very nice navy color. I agree they look much better than the Dakotas. Given the way Mitsus are (or aren't) selling they could be making some pretty good deals on them, and I think they have a better warranty as well.

As a side note, the local Mitsu dealer used to be a Mitsu / Subaru dealer, and 2 or 3 years ago they sold the Subaru franchise to focus on Mitsubishi. I think that was probably about as good a move as a local Hyundai / Isuzu dealer who 5 years ago sold the Hyundai franchise. They're not around anymore...

9,2005-10-04T13:08:25+00:00,navigator89,"Today I saw a dark green Volkswagen Phaeton 6.0L W12. It's a beautiful car to look at, and the interior is amazing, better than anything from Mercedes, Lexus or BMW. It was also very large, yet very elegant. Seeing a Phaeton is really rare for me.

guss, the Lincoln Aviator has been out since 2003!!! I can't believe you haven't seen one yet, lol!"

I just saw a new Commander with dealer plates on it. It should look as good as a Cherokee Classic, instead it looks like an old Grand Wagoneer with the woody siding removed.

Not just ugly but drab."

The need for a third row for families is real, but they tend to be cramped and uncomfortable when automakers squeeze a third row in a medium sized suv (Volvo, land rover). The Commander is bizarre, I do not predict succes in the sales column"
17,2005-10-06T08:30:18+00:00,boomchek,"Yeah true. I mean there's boxy but ok looking (Element, Scion, G Wagen, old Suburban from mid 90's), boxy and nice (300C), and boxy and ugly (Commander). For some reason the whole thing just doesnt click.

Overall a nice design for a small car. It looks like it has no trunk space from the outside, but when you open it it is very large. Interior seemed to be a huge upgrade. ABS and Side curtain airbags standard. This one had 4 wheel disk brakes and aluminum wheels. Nice for bargain basement transportation."

FLY Yellow is also a ""signature color"" for Ferraris and has been used on numerous racing Ferraris. FLY=Ferrari light yellow.

Black, Silver and Titanium look great on F-cars, in fact a Silver '63 250 Berlinetta Lusso

Ther are a few R-Classes around now and I think it looks really slick. If you have need of a minivan but want something upscale this is your new option. Nice with a roof rack as well, seems like it's not to exravagantly priced with the V-6 instead of the 500.

I have not seen any of the new family haulers in NYC, No HHRs, no Sonatas, No refreshed accords, no Impalas. I think the fact is in Manhattan if you can afford a car at all ($400/month for a garage minimum) you can afford a really nice car.

Walked over to the Lexus dealer and looked at the new IS350. Much much better looking than in the pictures. Makes the TSX looks plain in comparison.

Also spotted the new Toyota Yaris 4 door hatch. Not a bad looking econobox, will have to see it upclose soon."

I think while it isn't over all the most gracefully executed shape certain details are fantastic, particularly the front end. It is difficult with swooping cars to get the ends right and the rear isn't as beautiful (The CLS has this issue with both of it's ends IMO). It is a great looking car though. I used to work promoting beemers and I have driven nearly every lexus model so I am very set in my opinions that Lexus makes nice but ridiculously boring cars. However I want to try this one out.

Also spotted another W12 audi"

It's still really cool and does look better in darker colors but it just doesn't do it for me. Honestly if one had the quarter million or so for one of these wouldn't you rather have something dripping sex appeal like a vanquish or a Murcielago? I realize that these are in slightly different categories but since the back seats are all but vestigial anyway we can consider them competitors. I don't particularly care for the Giugaro show car based on it either. Bit of a disapointment really although the spy shots of the upcoming 600 that share the design DNA are much more encouraging Especially the possible engine cover glass showing off the cylinder heads like the Peugot concept from a year ago.

Seen a few new VW Passats...I doesn;t look as sleek as the 02-05 models.

Saw a refreshed 06 PT Cruiser yesterday.

Today in the parking lot of another realtors office a Bentley Continental GT in silver.

I don't know if the were buying, selling or brokers but the Real Estate market must be still doing all right.

The unusual part was the Maserati was a four door and the Bentley was a 2 door. When I think of these brands I picture them the other way around."

3 Priuses
Sonata
Monte Carlo (new front, old back, looks strange)
A8
Civic coupe (sharp)
2 300s
Galant

Pathfinder (same one as last time, parked in the same spot!)
Mini Cooper (one coupe, one convertible)
5 series
4Runner
Lexus GS
Cobalt sedan

Busy lunch!

If I were in the market for a high end 4 door I'd toss the practical options (STS? 7 series? S-class? LS430?) out the window and go for the Maser. Of course I'm not in that market, and I probably never will be, but still.

Oops! :blush: As I drove past, I could see that the H3's bumper was pushed inward and upward.

Personally, I think the sedans are a little odd - Saturn-like ugliness and some odd proportions (but no lameo 4 spoke wheels and cartoon interiors), which makes sense given the design background. But the coupes are better."

I sat in...
Range Rover Vogue Supercharged
Hummer H2
Range Rover Sport
Audi A6
Audi A8
Audi A3
Audi A4
Dodge Charger
Chrysler 300
Chrysler Crossfire
Volkwagen Passat
Jeep Grand Cherokee
Subaru Forester
Toyota Avalon
BMW 750Li
Infiniti Q45
new Accord
Mustang convertible
Euro Focus (very nice)
Hyundai Azera
refreshed Grand Marquis, (looks classier)

and a lot more cars! The best one I sat in was definitely the Audi RS4. You can read my impressions in the thread there. Beautiful car, with nice, grippy shifter, carbon fiber trim, special wheel, body kit, and sport seats.

I also many other exotics, like the Porsche Cayman, Carrera GT, Lamborghini Gallardo and Murcielago, Jaguar XK, Jaguar XJ Portfolio, Rolls Royce Phantom. Man, that car was big! They also had a Charger RT with a 440, and a Corvette Sting Ray with a 427. Not too many concepts, excep the Lexus LFX, and something from Skoda.

I'll post pictures soon.

Anyway today I saw a Hummer H3 in red. Very tidy looking. I wanted to sit in at the show, but the models were full of people. :mad:

And a white SL55 AMG zooming down the highway.

Question for you guys, how are autoshows there? What kind of cars can you sit in, and how much is admission. I remember at Toronto admission was high, it was very crowded and you could only sit in everyday cars. Admission here was free!!!"
15,2005-11-15T01:09:12+00:00,ateixeira,"The biggest ones are Detroit, Chicago, New York, and LA. The catch, however, is that a lot of the nicer, newer cars are roped off. Concepts especially.

So in a strange way, the small-town shows are better. I used to go to the DC auto show and even though they would get the same cars Detroit got 9 months later, more of them are open for you to crawl inside.

It really depends, if you are car shopping, seriously, you have to get inside. So the big shows may actually not be the best.

If you are just browsing, and want to measure crowd reaction to the cars, there's nothing like the Detroit. I've been the last 2 years. It's huge.

Most of the cars you can sit in except the high end luxury marques. Sat in the Acura RL, the BMWs, Audis were open, but all Jags, Land Rovers, and most of the high end Benzes were locked up.

We get quite a few exotics and concepts here as well.

This year's show had the RR Phantom, a bunch of Porsches, a ton of GM concepts, the Ford GT, Lambos and a couple of Ferraris if I remember correctly. Last year we had a Maybach 57 on display as well."

I didn't see an S class at that show, which surprised me. Cheaper performance cars like WRX/EVO/etc were all open too, and had as much of a crowd as the higher end cars. I am pretty sure the XLR was open too. I'm not a SUV fan so I didn't look at those. I went to the Vancouver show in the spring, and sat in a SL65, C55, S500. I was surprised they had that SL open, and that was my highlight of the show. Maybe it's because MB are so common in Vancouver, but there were no crowds around them either. The dealers at the stand were also surprisingly nice. Of course the exotics like Lambos/Ferraris/Rolls etc were not open for such viewing, but I didn't expect them to be.

I am seeing new Infiniti M quite often now, and it's competitor the new GS is a daily sight here too. Quite a few new 3ers too, and I agree, the design works."

Sometimes I go for a walk on nice weekend days, and I prefer to walk through a ritzy residential area near where I live. There's one house I walk by that has a SL55, S55, and C55, all in black. I wonder if the guy owns the local MB dealer or is just set in his tastes."

Also sat in a BMW 6 Series. The interior is fabulous and the wood is rich.

And I sat in some other cool SUVs, like the Infiniti QX56, Lincoln Navigator, FX35, Yukon and Envoy Denali. Also tried out all the French cars from Peugeot, Renault and Citroen. They have some pretty neat designs, like the Renault Clio Sport, Espace, Peugeot 607, 407 Citroen C5 and Picasso."

Lexus IS - still not common around here
Civic coupe

Ranger Rover Sport - huge wheels can't possibly go off road
A6 - large mouth bass
Tribeca - in that dark Maroon color

I liked the older Grand Marquis grille from '98-04 (I think it got changed a tad for '02?) It just seemed to have more ""depth"" to it, and more of a quality, expensive piece."

Since it isn't a convertible, it would really cut down on the poseur sales anyway. I don't think it would dilute the brand."
22,2005-12-06T19:06:59+00:00,ateixeira,"A show-off would opt for the Boxster for just $2600 more, since it would appear to be more expensive. Enthusiasts and track regulars would buy the Cayman. That's exactly what Porsche should want.

I think the problem is that on the '92-94, the grille was just too small and square for the rounded shape of the car. And the whole effect with the narrow grille and wide headlights just looked awkward.

His '95 wasn't bad looking, but I just think the '98 had a more muscular, aggressive stance to it. Not something that your typical Grand Marquis buyer is looking for, but I remember at the time I kinda wanted one."

How many G55's has Mercedes sold anyway, like 20?

For the money, I'd take either a Cayenne, X5, Range Rover Sport, or even an ML63.

36,2005-12-09T17:01:08+00:00,teds1,"The DTS is officially common in NYC because of our high livery cab population. These guys turnover their vehicles every three years or so due to regulations and the heavy use they put on the cars so The DTS is already very common.

I do prefer to ride in them more than Town cars because those fat lazy wallowing lincoln suspensions make me nauseaous (I'd prefer to be picked up at the airport in a lotus and bounce all the way home on the expansion joints, thats just how I am).

As always my park avenue office has had its share of Uber sedans parked around it recently. Maybachs (the 4 seasons near by offers them to guests) are common if you can belive it and you can't swing a dead cat without hitting an s-class A8 w12 or 750.

The Solstice was on the back of a car carrier full of other Ponchos. Looked like it was from a different planet compared to the G6s, etc. Very sexy in black.

The Tribeca was notable for one reason... it had a bar code marking it as a rental car. Not a good sign at all.

MX5 - Looked very good in white. A bit of a wallflower compared to the heavily styled (overstyled?) Solstice, but also much less likely to be the ""flavor of the month"". Remember when everyone loved the looks of the PT Cruiser?

STS4 - This was a V8 AWD model, and had some real presence. STS wears Art & Science very well.

CLS - From some angles it looks very sexy, from others it's awkward or even downright frumpy. Strange looking car. I'd personally pick the...

Quattroporte. Dark blue. The styling is even better in person. It's just not right for a 4 door to be that attractive.

47,2005-12-12T15:12:01+00:00,teds1,"Yesterday in less than one hour of shopping around 57th and 5th (near Tiffany&#146;s, Harry Winston, Tourneau, the plaza etc) I saw a black phantom (nobody in the rear but definitely a driver not the owner), Maybach 62, Bentley CGT (young driver with loud hip hop), an S65 (perhaps the rarest car of the bunch which nobody else seemed to notice, a CLS500 (didn&#146;t even turn a head), and inside the Tourneau store a special display for Porsche design (they make watches now) with a black Carrera GT that you could go up and touch. All the rest of the cars were stuck in traffic or at crosswalks surrounded tightly by people.

We get a lot of luxo barges but you would have to be nuts to drive a high strung V10 with a fidgety ceramic clutch in midtown traffic on potholes so I never expected to see the Porsche up close in the city. It was pretty awesome I must say, a very special car, but from what I have read it is difficult to drive. This one had a CF shifter instead of the wood I have seen in magazine shots and peachy orange interior. I feel bad for whoever winds up with this example though, it was covered in fingerprints and had some swirls in the finish from all the up close attention.

As for the rest of the cars here is the observation:
While EVERYONE stared at the Phantom and the CGT. No one even noticed the Maybach or the S65, and this was in tightly packed midtown holiday shopping traffic
So if you are in the mood for a $400k land yacht but don&#146;t want anyone to notice you, the Maybach is the choice The S65 is the choice for people who appreciate the engineering of the amazing motor, not for the style conscious."

The problem with the phaeton was that it pretty much was an A8. There are some differences to be sure but I don't like it when GM rebadges cadillacs as buicks, or chevys either. You have to have more distinctive products. If you could have a phaeton or an A8 you would go for the audi every time based on looks, heritage, status, etc...(price not a consideration, I hear second hand phaetons are among the best car deals in the world right now)
Personally though I was never that put off by the ""high end VW"" oxymoron thing. All car companies are going into new segments, the historical stratification means less and less.

To me, looked liked they probably compromised utility (people and cargo room) for style for styles sake, and not good style at that."

I saw a new impala, 06 accord, civic coupe, and a BMW 3 series wagon as well. The wagon looks great. I drove the last version extensively and I can assure you it was one of the worst buys they had in the line up the 325xi with the extra weight of awd but no 30.0 liter engine (so as not to interfre with X5 sales... and then they introduced the X3 for some reason!) It was heavy slow and fishtailed easily. Hope this one is better.

The real beauty was a black DB9 this morning. There is no doubt that this is THE BEST LOOKING CAR ON THE ROAD when you see one in person. There really isn't a discussion here, it is not up for debate any more. Especially when he peeled out and the V12 screamed down park avenue echoing on the buildings.

I also passed a porsche dealer (cheating I know) that had a cayman in the window (as well as a carrera GT) just got a glimpse but it looked sweet."

I'll check the local K-Mart lot Friday/Saturday eve to see if it is among the cars that hang out there like a modern car cruise-in. Personally I like the cars that show up at Steak-n-Shake but they don't do that when it's cold."

Saw two Bentely Continental GTs, one silver, one gold on the weekend in the rain.

On Friday we brought in a black MB CL55 AMG for a client who traded in an 05 BMW 5 series. I love the looks of the CL Benzes, absolutely stunning.

And the best one was that finally after two plus months of wheeling, dealing, and negotiating, I managed to finish the deal for my customer who wanted to trade in his 2003 SL55 AMG for a Odyssey Touring.

After it was all done I hopped in the SL and toyed around with all the switches, and the retractable hard top. Neat car I shall say."

When the light became green, he just blasted away with a lot of noise and it was amazing to see just how fast this superar could accelerate.

I think Hyundai selling some Sonata's to rental fleets so you don;t truly know if they have a true hit on their hands.

- Mercury Milan - It was parked so I was able to check it out. It's looks well made but I think the 500 is better looking. I think that the dash cluster looks too upright and close in on you.
- Ford 500
- VW Passat - The rear quarters may look too elongated and slab sided
- Buick Lucerne
- VW Jetta - with a big dent on the back door. Ouch!! It sucks when a new car doesn't make it a year without getting hit
- Isuzu Axiom - not new but definately an unusual sighting. How many of those do you see but they're really good looking.

You mean the Mark LT. IMO it's a very handsome truck, no doubt about that - but what was Lincoln thinking when they made it??? Now that the new 403hp, six speed Escalade EXT is here, the Mark LT has no chance of competing. As an indication of how dead the Mark LT is to people, look at the Mark LT message board on edmunds. 189 posts, the last one made almost a month ago!

I give the Mark LT two years. By 2008 I'm sure Lincoln would have phased it out."

As well, I spotted a Porsche Cayman at the adjacent Porsche lot.

I also saw another Lucerne - this one kind of a candy apple red, and it appeared to be a private car. I thought it was a Passat from a distance. These seem to be doing OK here, which is somewhat surprising."

- Someone else got an Impala. This is a more basic car with cloth interior and plastic wheel covers. It's not much to look at but I didn't get close enough to make a judgement on build quality.

The train station is an interesting place for car watching. You get all types there. There are alot of bona fide station cars that are 15 years or older. One old timer drives a clean powder blue 70s Granada and someone else drives a well preserved white 79 to 81 Trans Am with all decals intact. Someone else drive a little Triump convertible there everyday. On top of those there are some serious beaters.

13,2006-02-02T15:53:09+00:00,jcat707,I saw a new 2006 Chevy Monte Carlo. I had no idea they redesigned them. There has been no advertising for them.
14,2006-02-02T17:15:11+00:00,prosa,Recently I've been seeing more and more G35's. Mostly the regular sedans; the X versions and especially the coupes are much less common. I'd guess that in my area (Long Island) G35's alone seem to outnumber all Lexus models.

16,2006-02-02T20:42:26+00:00,jefferyg,"passed me on the interstate this morning. Still had the window sticker in it so it had not been sold. I saw it a couple of hours later at Day Motors in McComb, MS. It was almost maroon. Not a bad color.

It looked pretty nice coming down the road except for the grill. Something looks out of proportion about it and the Bowtie is too big for the crossmember it's on.

On the whole it looked like they borrowed a couple of designers from Nissan. The lines are very reminiscent of the Armada. Not that it looks like one, but the sheetmetal is squared off like the newer Nissans.

I didn't stop at the dealership to see the interior. I hope they've made some major upgrades from the prior models.

With all that said, my first impression was that I was not all that impressed. The new Tahoe is another generic full-sized SUV. However, if Chevy carries this design over to their full-sized trucks, while still not anything exciting, it is a marked improvement."

It sure doesn't help Cadillac's image when some 90 year-old geezer in a straw hat wearing a pink shirt, plaid slacks pulled up to his chest with a white belt and shoes and smoking a big smelly cigar motors up to the light in his new Caddy sporting the carriage roof, gold package, faux wire wheels and Vogue tyres as the snooty yuppie Lexus driver looks on in disgust.

The irony is that they had to make it look Japanese to finally get some attractive styling on a Ford. It is better looking than any Toyota at the moment for sure. I hope it works out for them. I have seen the other versions already (Milan Zephyr) and I was way less impressed. The chrome add ons just hide the basic fusion shape which is nice.

26,2006-02-16T03:03:20+00:00,ghulet,"Just went to the Chicago Auto Show yesterday, so saw some new stuff. A few observations:

-liked the Toyota Yaris, and was quite impressed that the 3-door hatch starts at $11k with a/c (though if history is any indication, good luck finding a stripper), though the rear seat is laughable. Perfect car for someone who thinks the current Civics and Corollas are still a bit too much car to drive alone, park on city streets or schlep to the train. The sedan looks almost the size of a Corolla, but for a bit less money (and with a bit less engine--it has the 106hp unit from the Scions, which IIRC was the Echo engine). Speaking of Scions, the xA was one of my S.O.'s favorites, though it's been out two years. The Yaris is a bit more 'fresh', but with the xA, you don't have to mess with Toyota's maddening options bundling/unavailability, they come with everything for $133xx.

Surprisingly, I wasn't too impressed with the Hondas; the Civics seem too big, still hate the dash, and they're expensive ($17800 for an LX?). The Accords seemed pricey too (except for the EXV6 6-speed sedan, which I love, and seems a bargain at $28xxx); even the VP, with its black trim, cheapo wheel covers and two speakers MSRP was $197xx. I know most aren't paying MSRP, but still.

-I wasn't impressed with the new Camry, don't like the styling and the new trend toward the silvery plastic everything interior is not good, IMO. It looks smaller than the outgoing model."
27,2006-02-16T14:19:36+00:00,navigator89,"while at Starbucks, a light blue Bentley Continental GT coupe. Since it was parked across from my car I got a good look at and in it.

The interior is classy without being showy and they have a crisp shape. What impressed me most was the commercial where they said it starts at $26k. The small print said the ""as shown"" model was $31k with a V8. Supposedly they are ""Lexus Quiet,"" as well. All of a sudden their market becomes very clear. Anyone buying an ES350/ avalon would really have to think about getting the larger more powerful buick (brand image aside). That pricing makes it really competetive since it is based on the $50k plus DTS.

We did finaly swap it out for a boring silver one because someone half way across the country wanted that particular color Supercharged Sport.

The RDX looks sporty and appears to have a good suspension that should give it sport/lux sedan driving characteristics. Unfortunatly GM doesn't have one yet. The Enclave is a little to large, and I'm not sure how big the next Envoy/Trailblazer will be. What I'd like to see is a return of a GMC Syclone/Typhoon edition.

Looks kinda cool, like a squashed mini XLR. Something about the huge rubber makes it look awkward, with such a pancaked body it looks like it was dropped on the chassis of a monster truck...

Interesting, C&D just came out with a timely comparo, and they liked the Fit and the Versa. Caliber was in the same comparo and scored poorly. Even though it's a lot longer, it's not nearly as space efficient and the Versa was actually a lot roomier, they said.

3. '06 Mazda 5 Tourer

As the front drivers side tire started to come up the other side of the ditch the frame was tweaked so badly that the driveline bound up. The truck could not move forward our backward and the body was pinching all of the doors shut. He had to call on his cellphone for help.

After a few of the techs sat on the opposite side of the hood and stood on the back bumper they were able to take enough of the stress off the driveline that he could back out.

We don't let any other vehicles but Land Rovers on the test track now.

46,2006-04-12T16:09:17+00:00,210delray,I know from a Toyota insider that the Camry hoodline was in fact raised because of the pedestrian regulations. He agreed with me that the older design looked better.
47,2006-04-12T20:18:20+00:00,british_rover,Yaris or whatever that new tiny Toyota is. Not sure if I liked it will have to wait till I see one up close.
48,2006-04-12T22:50:30+00:00,kyfdx,"New Yaris sedan... They should have made the 4-door a hatchback...

Also, right behind it.... a new '07 Camry.. The XLE model... I kind of like it.. Not as boring as before.."

I've seen my first couple of Camrys. It's pretty sharp... not headturning but nice looking. Definately not nearly as bland as the last."
0,2006-04-13T00:02:35+00:00,british_rover,I agree I do not like the new IS's at all. The IS 300 was a good looking car and I liked the 3.0 I6 over he four cylinder or V6 they offer now.
1,2006-04-13T02:42:42+00:00,210delray,"What 4-cylinder? In the good ol' USA, you get a V6 or V8!"
2,2006-04-13T07:21:57+00:00,merc1,"A co-worker just got one of these new Camrys and I have to say it looks so much better than the previous model. It's actually very sleek and what not. I wish Toyota didn't feel the need to saddle the SE model with that somewhat generic looking body kit, but the biggest fly in the buttermilk is that snout, specifically that emblem. Yuck. You'd think that with such a good looking design overall (for a Toyota) they would have been able to intergrate Toyota's symbol (whatever it is) better than that. Really messes up the front end big time to me. Still though there has never been a better looking Camry. We'll see how it looks after the first 500K units hit the road.

3,2006-04-13T13:29:38+00:00,british_rover,"Actually the orginal Turbo 4 cylinder offered in the Altezza, what the IS300 was called in the Japan, was superior to any of the engines offered in the US.

That motor had more power then the IS300, more power then the IS250 and about the same power as the IS350. The real advantage was that the engine was very small, light and pushed far back against the firewall for improved weight distribution. I think the Altezza had a nearly 50/50 weight balance."

22,2006-04-19T12:39:59+00:00,gsemike,"I went out of my way to see it at the auto show. It's definately handsome and more masculine than that Solstice. It looks like it costs more than 25k inside and out.

But.... at 5'7"", I couldn't stretch out in the passenger seat with the seat all the way back and with the top down, there is practically no storage space. These are fatal flaws. What good is a roadster when I can't throw a bag in the trunk, drop the top and take a 4 or 5 hour trip upstate?"
23,2006-04-19T13:42:21+00:00,teds1,"I also went to the NY Auto show yesterday for about 4 hours (My friends were annoyed but it's my Mecca).
Some Thoughts and Finds
-The AM Vantage V8 is actually that amazing looking up close, even in white like the demo they had. It is just perfect design, Equvalent to the 911 in it's classic shape. They will be collecting them in 50-75 years for sure.
-The Sky is much better looking than the solstice but I have to agree with the above threads, both cars are too small. I am 5' 9"" and my legs were cramped in the footwells and I couldn't move the seat back to a comfortable position. there is no way I would buy a roadster this small unless it was made by Lotus. On a side note the funniest point in the evening was when I had a 6' 8"" friend (not a typo) try and sit in an S2000. It wasn't even close.
-The BMW Z4 Coupe looks fantastic in person... it has just jumped up many notches on my ""I want it list.""
-The New AMGs with the 6.3 liter motors almost look like overkill now, these aren't Q ships anymore as they are clearly the biggest flashiest most badged up Benzes out there. Also some are going to say this is sacrilege but the SLR looks dated for some reason.
-Caymans look great in Black, ok in silver, terrible in red
-The Bentley GTC is much ado about an obvious idea
-The New G35 is lovely and the old ones are still some of my favorite cars to sit in. I am legitimately looking at the coupe.
-Perhaps the most fun car at the show and my favorite t play around in was the FJ Cruiser. I am not an suv off roader type at all but this toyish Tonka truck that looks like a hotrodded classic FJ has captured my heart. For only $22k nicely equipt you will want one too. It is too much fun.
-The Lucerne is very nice inside and a bargain compared to the lexus competition. Low power and bad fuel milage from that crappy GM V8 though.
-Saab is not going to be around so long I think
-The new CX9 Mazda van thing looks great, so does the Buick concept van thing. It is very lux and will probably sell well.
-The TT is kind of chunky, not as svelte as pictures
-The Mazdaspeed 6 is less impressive than I expected, less good looking even than the regular 6s. Kind of a let down.
-The GTI (My Fast hates plaid seats) is pretty cool up close. I like the wheels but I have too many bad VW quality horror stories to ever go down that route again.
- Ferrari made poor choices in it's display cars, an odd two toned Scaglietti, a decaled up 430 CS with limited appeal, and a nice grey 430 spyder which they hid begind a podium. I guess they don't have to care too much but still they could have done a better presentation.
-Those Dodge Chrysler muscle car hemi variations have really crappy build quality, Panel gaps, loose seals were evident. Not impressive
-The aspen is about 7 years too late
-Only Russian Mobsters are still admiring the H2
-The new Navigator grill is obscene... you will see what I mean when they hit the streets...

Sorry about the long post but it was too much fun. Go to the show if you can and play around in those FJs, I like the Yellow one."
24,2006-04-19T14:46:45+00:00,ateixeira,"Aston Martin has easily the best looking lineup of cars in the industry, bar none. People would just stand there and stare, mouth agape.

Sky Redline looked good. But I dunno, I kind of like the idea of a $20k toy more than a high 20s sports car.

Z4 coupe I did not like, but I was with Bob H. and he loved it.

G35 looked better. A lot like the old model, but evolutionay improvements. We both liked it, minus the chrome spoiler on the back.

FJ is hot and trendy, and both models on the floor were PACKED with people (compared to a ghost-town surrounding the Acura MDX). But...ergonomics are awful. The seat belt is anchored in the door, so to let someone out of the back seat you have to take your seatbelt off, which is absurd.

Funny thing is the Element is the same way, but the concept Honda showed had the seat belt integrated into the seats, like in the Chrysler Sebring and some GM pickups. Much better execution.

FJ also has horrible blind spots, and wasn't as easy to climb in as the Element.

I liked the CX9 as much as you did, but the CX7 seemed a lot smaller than I expected so that disappointed me.

GTI plaid looks awful. Agreed.

I also agree about the Ferrari stand, weakest I've ever seen from them. No brochures at all, either.

H2 was crowded when I was there. Must still be a lot of mobsters in NY.

Navigator and Escalade both have cartoonishly large grilles. I'd go with the GMC version for that reason alone, or even a Tahoe. But GM was dumb not to put magic 3rd row seats in there.

I liked the Fit too. Space is incredible. Reminds me of the xB a little, but with less rear leg room and more cargo room.

32,2006-04-29T17:23:57+00:00,fintail,"Yeah that's right....""hate on me"" is kind of like ""envy me"". Kind of funny, as although a TSX is a nice car, it's not exactly a super-status luxobeast."

The funny thing I saw was a new 07' Black Escalade racing a Orange RR Sport(what it looked like) a day ago on the way home from work. The RR Trophey Wife, was racing a Guy in a Escalade. The Slade had 22's on it. The funny thing was the embarrassment look on the Trophey Wife's face after she just glared at the guy in the Slade. It took me a few seconds to catch up with them.

I once had a guy in a Slade try to race me. It was over with quickly. I hope the guy's dad finds out what his son was doing in his car.

Looking at the sales figures for March, it seems the Zephyr and Milan are selling neck and neck. Only a few units seperate them. With those two sitting at a Lincoln-Mercury dealer, I'd imagine people being impressed by the Zephyr, but lured by the Milan's price."

It makes sense though, in these Nassau county towns where everyone makes at least $500k and the home all cost $2m+ a CGT is an expensive but within reach aspirational purchase for most residents. I bet 50% of the population in the county could afford one if they really wanted to. It just kills the exclusivity factor for what should be a pretty exotic car.
Also a Maserati Spyder and a bunch of sl55s. This morning I saw a silver F430 spyder on the upper west side which was sort of odd.

Saturday night a Blue Vanquish was parked outside the starbucks in Astor Place... sweeeeet and rare.
Ferrari 308 black out for a Sunday Drive as well.
My new favorite the Toyota FJ in Black on saturday night as well. Screw the ergonomics and practicality, it looks so damn fun!
Re: the RR discussion, the sport is getting very common in NYC (the big RR was already a uniform for the fashion set they comprise at least 50% of all garages south of houston), not the supercharged ones though.

The best we could do on the wholesale side was $165,000. We might take it to auction under consignment and have one of our wholesale buyers represent the car see how much we can get."

Toyota yes they could put anything with their name on it and it well sell like Hotcakes. Honda uhh no. The current Accord and last generation 01-05 Civic were criticzed by the Honda faithful for their conservative styling. Remember mid to late 90's Acura struggled too after they axed the Legend. It wasn't until the release of the 99 TL and 01 MDX that the Acura brand got back on track.

The problem is with Toyota is they have no style of their own. Now their take styling cues off of Mazda cars and in the late 90's they were taking styling cues off of Mercedes for their Lexus brand. I respect Toyota and what they have done but styling is not a strength of theirs."

Dodge will be releasing the Caliber in a month or so, and a little while after the Nitro. I think then we'll get the new Avenger, but apparently the bosses don't want to bring the Charger over here because there's too much of an overlap between it and the 300.

Shame, 'cause they look hot and if they brought over a base V6 & V8 they could steal some Commodore/Falcon sales, and an R/T could steal a few Falcon XR/Commodore SS sales. The journos are already pitching the 300 SRT as a FPV (Ford Performance Vehicles) and HSV (Holden Special Vehicles) killer."

I saw my first and only Phaeton about 3 months ago. Tragically it was in New Orleans and it had been submerged in water completely in the driveway of their home! :sick:"

As for Phaetons, they are very rare indeed. Since they came out, I've only seen somewhere between 5-10!"

The owner of the Italian place across the street from me has one.

Stunning car.

So 120,000 for a top of the line Quattroporte Exectutive GT with a nearly 400 hp Ferrari engine or...

An A8 for about the same money a little more HP but boring looking.

A 7 Series and XJR can be had for about the same money but only the XJR is near as sexy.

The S-class costs more and is about as common as a Honda Civic in some parts of the country.

I know what I would buy with my money."

And, you.... working at a Land Rover store might not think twice about it... but, how much do you think it is going to cost to maintain that Maserati? Most 4-doors aren't weekend cars that you take out when it is sunny... A car like that will probably be driven 10K-20K miles/yr...

Those Italian cars... Don't they use Extra Virgin Olive Oil at $50/qt.?

41,2006-05-15T20:15:32+00:00,british_rover,"That wouldn't surprise me. Infiniti has this technology out now that mounts cameras in multiple locations around the vehicle to give you some vision to make up for their poor body designs.

Land Rover had a concept a couple of years ago called Land_e that had clear composite built into the lower portions of the doors and front/rear fenders to give better visibility. Maybe not very practical but useful when driving off-road or in a tight spot."

I made about a round-trip drive of about 20 miles each way on the Long Island Expressway (I-495) this evening. Westbound traffic was quite heavy what with people returning from their holiday weekends in the Hamptons. And, as one might imagine, the cars were definitely on the upscale side. I saw so many Mercedes and BMW's that for a moment I thought I'd been teleported to Germany! Audis and Porsches (mainly Cayennes) were also in ample supply. Which isn't to say that all of the costly vehicles were German; Lexuses and, to a slightly lesser extent, Infinitis were common too, though there weren't too many Acuras. American luxury vehicles, in contrast, were a rare sight, with just a handful of Escalades and Navigators.

The more I think of it, the single most unusual thing about the vehicles I saw was the unusually high number of Range Rovers. I wasn't counting them at first, but after seeing a steady progress of them I started keeping count. Believe it or not, I counted 17 of them in the space of 20 minutes."

2006 Range Rovers have clear upper tail lights instead of the orange from the 2003-2005. They have clear side markers instead of the orange from 2003-2005.

The last bit is that their lower halogen headlights are set inboard from the main upper bi-xenon light cutting slightly into the grill. The 2003-2005 Ranges have the halogen lights are directly underneath the bi-xenon light.

This morning already we have had three range Rovers, of course duh, but a truck did drop off our next Supercharged Range Rover that is of course already pre-sold.

Also one of my customers came by to drop off his range for service and left in his brand new M6.

That is a nice vehicle in everyway except the trunk looks like a total afterthought.

46,2006-05-30T20:25:18+00:00,prosa,"Sure seems like one. While walking around lower Manhattan at lunch today I saw a S550 double-parked outside a very expensive apartment house, as a fat 50ish man put a suitcase in the trunk and then got behind the wheel. What a beautiful vehicle. It was a sort of metallic blue with what I believe were the optional 19"" alloys. And the way it shone in the sunlight, it was almost painful to look at!

Oh, as for the mobster bit ... as the driver was putting the suitcase in the trunk his suit jacket gaped open revealing a holstered pistol. Now, it's almost impossible to get a concealed-carry permit in NYC, and I'd rather doubt many cops could afford an S-class or to live in the adjacent apartment building (not to mention that he was at least 50 pounds beyond even the most lenient physical-fitness standards for law enforcement officers). The driver didn't seem to care that his pistol was visible, which seems to rule out an ordinary citizen carrying an illegal weapon or the average criminal type. Now, a top-level Mob boss wouldn't care, so that's who I think he was.

Hmmmm ... now I'm wondering exactly what - or whom - was in that suitcase"

As I'm heading into my child rearing years (my first is on the way), I'm glad that someone is making a minivan that is actually mini. It looks like it would be plenty big enough for a family of 4 and could actually remain a little agile.

I almost bought a 6 a few years ago but I hated the seats. If I get into van mode, let's see if I can handle the seats in the 5."
9,2006-06-05T02:34:42+00:00,prosa,"Around noon today I spotted my first CX-7. Not on the road, but parked in front of the local Mazda dealership in a spot visible to everyone driving by on the main road. I first thought it was a 6 wagon. It was a bit smaller than I would have expected. Not bad looking, though I wonder if rear visibility might be limited given the low roofline. Also, has Mazda given any thought as to whether the CX-7 might compete with the 5?
Later in the day I saw a Milan in the next lane with a Fusion following right behind. Both were white, which actually made it easier to compare the two. Seeing them close together clearly illustrates what ""badge engineering"" really means. Even someone who didn't know anything about cars could see at a glance that they are basically the same vehicle. That being said, I'd say the Milan is the more attractive of the two - or, more accurately, that the Fusion is the less attractive of the two, given its cheap-looking taillights and that ghastly Multiblade Shaving System grille!
Finally, in the evening I saw an orange Gallardo heading eastbound on the Long Island Expressway, no doubt on the way home from a weekend in the Hamptons. I actually heard it overtaking me before it came into sight. Its license plate read ""Sunny 06."" Well heck, dude, of course 2006's been a bright sunny year for you, seeing that you can afford a Gallardo - rub it in a little more, won't you :P"

It drives really well, you should try one out. I went to Zoom Zoom Live and took one on the autocross course, it was quicker than any van has the right to be.

The CX7 has less space but had AWD and the turbo. That plus prices will keep them from overlapping.

The 5 lacks stability control, AWD, and perhaps an upgrade engine to really sell in big numbers. But it has exceeded targets.

14,2006-06-06T00:40:15+00:00,ghulet,"...forgive me for being lazy, but what's its pricing like? I'm assuming they've kept the high-tech stuff and larger engines off to keep prices down. I think, if they promote it right, it could do well versus lower-priced minivans or smaller SUVs. It seems to bridge the gap pretty well. The TV commercial I saw for the CX7 showed an example that stickered a bit north of $30k, so I imagine the 5 is considerably cheaper, again to compete with the smaller vehicles (I'm guessing/hoping $19-25k or so). Considering how large and costly some 'mini' vans have become, I think there should be a considerable market for something a bit more reasonable, especially for small, young families who don't want the stigma of a minivan or the piggishness of most SUVs."

I think it looks OK, certainly not generic styling! The interior looks pretty sharp, and seems to have plenty of rear leg room, and cargo space too.

The front drive touring was 17.2ish K, and the GT AWD was just a tick over 30K, so probably comparable to the new Acura.

I would be curious to see how they drive, but MPG wasn't too hot considering it is a 4 cyl, although a pretty hot one, and I imagine that the CX is pretty porky.

Actually, speaking of porky, I saw a test the other day (in one of my magazines I haven't gotten around to reading) of the RDX (that the right name for the Acura?), and it weighed in at about 3,950 pounds. What a blimp for something that small."

I think that it is a nice looking car, but why does it have four bolt holes across the back bumper? Granted, they color key the covers, but there remains a dark outline that is visible from a distance. It's a very low rent touch and has no place on the ""American Lexus"". There was alos a new Impala and that didn't have the bolt holes. Even Kias and Suzukis don't have them anymore.

It's dumb stuff like that lack of attention to detail that turns people off to GM."

Something I have noticed on mostly ford products that have Park Distance control is that instead of color coding the sensors they leave them black. Looks really really bad and is just very poorly done. How much more would it cost to have them color coded to match the bumper?"
29,2006-06-07T14:28:29+00:00,ateixeira,"They should be mounted in the license plate area somewhere. Or just use a camera instead of sonar. I think they look tacky, too. I can't imagine they can't make that seamless.

To be an equal-opportunity critic, nothing it worse than the exhaust plug on some Volvos. Some models have dual exhaust, and others don't. But they cost-cut and only made one bumper. So the single-exhaust models have a cheesy looking plug to cover the hole where the 2nd exhaust tip would have been. Horrendous.

Any how, saw a Ridgeline in DC today, not many of those in the city.

Also saw a RAV4 Limited, they're everywhere now.

30,2006-06-07T14:46:28+00:00,british_rover,"In order to get equal coverage all around and to see the corners of the car some they must be precisly mounted in key locations so that their scan area overlaps. Every once in a while I see a car that only has two mounted by the rear license plate and that means there is a big gap in coverage. Basicly the automaker is being cheap.

To get complete coverage including corners you must mount at least four sensors and the two outboard ones must be mounted at an angle near the edge of the bumpers.

Next time you see a Range Rover up close take a look at their PDC sensor coverage it is nearly perfect. I can navigate those cars in the showroom almost purely with the PDC system and no spotters."
31,2006-06-07T14:50:24+00:00,ateixeira,"Are those seamless? I'm sure it's possible. They could mount behind the bumper. It's sonar, no line of sight required.

20,2006-06-18T22:18:17+00:00,fintail,I saw a new S class in grey today. Not so unusual (as I saw a black one about 5 minutes later) but the grey one wore those 800-spoke alloys MB has had for a few years now. It didn't look right somehow.
21,2006-06-18T22:59:58+00:00,odie6l,"There are few Prowlers running around the Hershey area, but only when the Temp or day is perfect. I still think Chrysler had a good car, but either neede more power or less $$$ for what it had.

23,2006-06-19T13:29:25+00:00,gsemike,"Much nicer than the Solstice. Side by side, the Solstice looks downright chintzy. The Sky looks like something to pull up at the country club driving. The Solstice looks like a girl's car."
24,2006-06-19T15:00:30+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Speaking of Prowlers, I saw a purple on e over the weekend, with the matching trailer. Still quite the eye catcher...

And I actually saw a Crossfire! I think those are about as rare as the Prowler."
25,2006-06-19T16:37:16+00:00,lemko,"...spotted a Cadillac SRX, Buick Rendezvous, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and a Hummer H2 in that order at lunch today. What did they all have in common? They were all driven by women."

Not really. In the past week here (Houston, Tx) I have seen 4 Crossfires 1 Black(my fav) 2 Silver and 1 White (first time to see a white one) I haven't seen a Prowler a couple of months and it was Yellow."
27,2006-06-19T17:25:57+00:00,carguy58,"a black Mazdaspeed 6 at the Jersey Shore on Friday. On the exterior design why does the radiator have to be so big? The radiator design almost takes up the whole bottom of the front end.

Oh yeah also saw a new Black Ford Fusion with new car dealer tags at the Jersey Shore too. I was like wow thats nice looking for a Ford!"
28,2006-06-19T19:04:14+00:00,ateixeira,"Oddly enough I saw one this weekend as well. They're very rare, even though they're not new and were actually discontinued long ago!"

No that wasn't the last model years Prelude that the tailights of the Fusion remind you of. The 92-96 Prelude was the second to last generation of Prelude. The 97-01 or 02(forgot what exact model year the Prelude got discontinued)was the last generation of Prelude.

As a matter of fact doesn't the Front of the Fusion remind anybody of the 97-01 or 02 Preludes front end? They are very close looking resemblance wise in terms of headlights design. The grille design of the 97-01 Prelude and Fusion are very different though."

(yes that's the C43 in the background)

That is seriously the ugliest supercar ever. Well, it gives the old Consulier a run for its money.

The owner can't park either, what a tool.

I do like the exhaust.

Now I need to find in a parking lot the Enzo I saw last year."
43,2006-06-21T17:16:25+00:00,ateixeira,"But he didn't really take up the two spots, not enough that a compact car wouldn't park right next to it and end up giving it a door ding. It just looks like he came in crooked.

FWIW, most Batmobiles were ugly, too.

Good for them I say"
11,2006-06-27T17:47:00+00:00,ateixeira,"Absolutely, and it brought a smile to my face.

It's not about income at all. I'm sure it's more complex to fit hand controls on a compact sports car versus, say, a more common mid-size sedan, or even a Chrysler van, where standard kits exist.

I'm glad to see a company make a fitment for a low-volume Porsche, and a brand new one at that. That's why I was impressed. :shades:

two Bentley CGTs, two bentley flying spurs
An M6, Bentley azure, DB9, and a quattroporte on one intersection in about 30 seconds of traffic on 3rd avenue
a yellow prowler (in florida), a red Z06 (Louisiana)
Many new S classes, calibers (I have taken to saying ewwwww when I see one), skys, solstices, and a CX-7

Also whoever wrote in about the MB Lemon a page or two back, that wasn't an SLR, it was a CLK-GTR which was a homologated le mans car, the same type which caught air and flipped over in the famous internet clip. A much more rare and exclusive car than the SLR actually. I have NEVER seen one of those and don't expect to since they aren't street legal here."

Also, an '06 Camry at the traffic lights behind an '05 Lexus ES. Certainly an interesting pair... the ES seems to be ever-so-slightly bigger in every dimension. As much as I don't like cars of its ilk (plush, boring V6 FWD luxo-mobiles), and as much as I despise the last-generation Camry (don't even get me started on it...), the last-gen ES certainly looks interesting, and I admire it for that. Reminds me of a big, content cat, and I love cats. Maybe it's not as sleek or as agile as a Jaguar or a jaguar, but certainly has its allure to me nonetheless.

I also saw a blue/blue Mini Cooper Cabrio, and a normal black Mini Cooper. Both are nice little cars, and not too cutesy or kitsch. A VW New Beetle you couldn't pay me too drive, but I wouldn't mind being given the keys to a Mini Cooper."

I still kind of like them actually one of the few GM products I would possibly buy new.

The 1991 model you saw was probably a SSE model bonne. For the day they were pretty advanced with digital dash, auto dimming rear view mirror and a bunch of other electronic stuff that is going to be broken now.

I agree the interior on those were a bit too pimped out.

The later SSEis were supercharged and had HUD units."

Our Taiwan-sourced facelifted Ford Escape has a really nice new interior, I noticed when I was on the net last night. Same console and dashboard (and same ugly circa 1995 Ford Probe steering wheel), but nice woodtrim, lights etc. It's weird, though, that over in the US the Tribute doesn't sell very well (correct me if I'm wrong) but over here it sells much better than the Ford Escape. But then, Mazda is enormously popular down under - often Number 4 in manufacturer overall sales, which is quite an achievement."

Then I saw a 356 speedster Porsche kind of blinged out, coudn't tell if it was a kit or not but it sounded great

Finally the weirdest of all was Wyclef Jean's White G-class Maybach... That is not a mistake, a while back I read in one of those DUBesque magazines that the Haitian singer had installed a maybach like interior in a white G500 down to the logo on the grill and seats. It still looked like a Gelandewagen but with no external trim, a different and a satelite dish. Really odd and kind of ugly for a guy who has the taste to collect Zondas and the almighty F1 McLaren.

I don't know about that, it seems to me most people realize that this is not how the cars come these days or are supposed to look. People still buy civics after seeing them with tacky aftermarket wings and bolt on kits. GM can't really control the aftermarket and in fact should embrace certain aspects of it. The demand for landau tops will die out naturally very soon and it will be a non issue but I don't think it is detering other potential customers of Caddy's and the like.
The bigger issue IMO is that they have painted themselves into a corner with the love it or hate it styling. There is always going to be a % of the vehicle buying public who just doesn't like the look."

Of course it would've been immediately apparent had I been able to see the front instead of just the side and rear.

There also was a blue '06 Legacy in the driveway. Assuming both vehicles belonged to the same household the choice of the Saabaru instead of a WRX was sort of odd. After all the people must like Subarus, why not just go for the less-expensive WRX?"
28,2006-07-17T17:30:14+00:00,ateixeira,"Depends upon the timing. Last summer you could get a 9-2x Aero for $19.4k with employee pricing, and Saab tosses in 2 free years of service (though you give up the roof rack). That's cheaper than any WRX.

- 2 CX-7s, both silver
- 2 Santa Fe's, in navy blue and maroon

My hotel is right next to an automall featuring 10 dealers, so I've seen plenty of goodies already. They have a blue FJ Cruiser with a manual, 3 Avalanches, in LS, LT LTZ trim, lots of Fits with automatics, and 3 CX-7s, two silver and one black, no navigation. Also there are a few Santa Fe's and Entourages. I really want to see a CX-7 in Copper Red, silver doesnt do it justice. There was also what I think was a 2007 Chevrolet Aveo out there.

BTW, I also saw my first Acura RL in more than a month of me being here. It was beige. Also saw a white STS with the landau roof, or whatever you call it."

48,2006-08-05T02:03:26+00:00,british_rover,"Getting rear ended by a big SUV in anything is pretty much going to ruin your day. In the Smart car you might at least have a chance to pull into the next lane and get out of the way because it is so small.

People used to ask me that all the time when I had the MINI. Aren't you worried about getting rear ended by a Suburban?

My normal answer was something like, ""The trick is to drive it a bit more like a motorcycle since it is so small and easy to maneuver. If you are in a motorcycle and see someone coming up to fast on you you are going to either jump out of the way or pull the bike into the next lane.""

Normally people would look at me with this dumb expression on their face and say something like, ""Wow I never pay attention to what is going on behind me when I am stopped at a red light.""

:confuse: How the human race has survived as long as it has blows my mind.

Additonaly the SMART is really more suited for very congested urban areas like New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston etc. Although I can see it being a great car to leave at say a lake house or beach house and also a great dingy car to pull behind a motor home."

Regarding the Fit, I saw a bunch at the Automall Honda dealer yesterday. They all had automatic transmissions. I was kinda taken aback to see the price for that tiny car to be $19K CAD. For that money Im sure you could get something better and cheaper. A 4cyl Malibu was only slightly more there. I also saw a 2003 Lincoln LS V8 with nav and leather for about $20K. I'd rather take that than buy a small $20K car.

ALso, a 300C super stretch limo. I think it looked better that way!

For starters it is kinda interesting to see the car culture differences up there (I used to live in MTl but didn't notice it as much) a bit more Euro with a small car focus.
I would say one out of every three cars on the road is a Mazda 3, so at least they have good taste
Plenty of smart cars (including the convertible) as well as others we don't get here like Nissan Xtrails, Ladas, Merc B classes (ugly if you ask me) etc...
Saw a bunch of mid engine Ferraris (like 7)in MTL and Quebec city, not surprising given the formula one popularity and the Mt. Tremblant driving school for ferrari owners.
also the same orange elise twice on two different days... It had to be the same one b/c we were in the middle of no where.

Really a Mazda underneath.
Not nearly as nice-looking as the concept.
Back end looks too much like that of my Dad's lousy 1981 Thunderbird.
Cheesy prop rod for the hood."

The car had flat plastic hubcaps that cheapened the look. Everything can't have alloy wheels, but these were particularly bad. They should have something that looks more like a spoked wheel.

This particular one was a stick. The car doesn't have much of a console and the shifter looked like a straight metal rod sticking out of the floor, much like an old European car. I know that they have to do these things to meet price targets, but these shortfalls really stood out on a car that otherwise looked pretty nice."

Styling is subjective but I like the front of the Zephyr/MKZ, and I LOVE the interior. It's unique and very striking, and looks best in the cream/light wood combination (it loses its presence in black). Now if the Zephyr/MKZ had RWD and a better engine (oh and shrink those taillights, while you're at it), I would probably buy it over a 3-Series/IS. Well, maybe. It'd be more of a heart purchase than a head."

Black DB9 parked... even my car illiterate girlfriend was impressed, Buick Grand National (it lives in my neighborhood)
Not my sighting but my brother caled to ask what a Qvale Mangusta was b/c he was stuck in traffic behind one.
Bunch of FJs, Maybachs, etc... an M6
One very odd looking Acura RL. Did it get a facelift or have I just not seen one in a while?
Also a silver Gallardo in Naples FL last week."

I have unfortunately spent waaaay too much time driving a new beetle (Mom's) and I have nothing but hatred for VWs these days. I know their recent quality issues are now well known but this car (a 2000 model year) is the biggest lemon I have ever encountered. You wouldn't believe how often simple mechanical stuff breaks at only 55k miles. At least it's a 5 speed. I'm just very wary of their products these days as a result.

Then today I saw an Escalade in beige with those shiny factory rims. That's the first I've seen in that color, but I like black better. Also saw a grey Tahoe.

GM sure nailed the styling on these SUVs. Each has its own personality, the Tahoe looks tough, the Yukon is like a budget Escalade and the Escalade is the king of full size SUVs."

Wiped out the whole side of the car and the impact caused the backend to swing around and tag the opposite side rear quarter of the car, right where the cells were located. It was pretty bad, but the battery pack remained intact and a typical flatbed came and picked up the car. There were no special treatments like roping off, laying down PIG mats or guys running around in orange jumpsuits. Just two guys and a wrecker.

Oh, and once the wreck was taken away, the guy hopped into his wifes car (who showed up in the meantime) and left. The lady in the Buick left in an ambulance."

I was expecting much worse results being that it was the first accident involving a hybrid that I had seen. But the crew in the wrecker treated it just like any other accident."

So it really is that expensive....Ouch !!!

An old V12 has to be some kind of labor of love, as they offer very little over a V8.

So the S500 V-8 pretty maintence free ?

I don't think the new ones are any different either. I talked to the guy who runs the independent MB shop where my cars go...says he has a customer with a W220 S600...every time it comes in for routine maintenance something needs fixing.

Why are they so unreliable I wonder ? One would think the German Engineering would yield very reliability. :surprise:

Are you talking about that James Bond style rig? I want that one too.

Yeah I think that is the one pal. :blush: I'm amazed the Germans couldn't engineer a superb V-12. :confuse: They engineered the greatest engine ever in the ZR-1 LT-5. I suppose that engine wasn't without flaws since it was known for blown head gaskets which were $1500 mininum a pop. :surprise:

7,2006-09-25T23:38:36+00:00,fintail,"It's an old extremely complex car. It will not be like a Civic from the same period. No MB is maintenance free, even the diesels require some tuning from time to time. All of that engineeing creates a painfully complex car, and there's usually an inverse relationship between complexity and reliability. It's just that they drive so well when everything is working, and people get hooked.

The engines themselves are almost always fine...it's the electricals and a few ancillary systems such as HVAC that are usually the problem. MB create this myth about lifetime transmission fluid in some 90s era cars that causes failures, too."

12,2006-09-26T18:47:20+00:00,bumpy,An S600 will eat you out of house and home. You need to get a nice S420. The maintenance requirements on one of those will be merely prodigious instead of ruinous.

I kinda like the strange wheel design they have, but nothing else makes me excited. You pay an awful lot for a marginal performance gain, and you get bad mileage and psychotic maintenance costs as a free gift. V12 just seems silly to me. You'll barely notice the difference over a S420 or S500. The later S320s aren't too bad either, on the road. It's a big boat, so it's hard to feel performance.

A W140 600SEL was maybe 120K back ca. 1993. Prices didn't change a lot through the model run, and even today they aren't a whole lot more."

Nice SLs from the late 90s are usually in the 20s. That style ceased in 2002, some of the last ones still carry high 30-40K prices, especially the final ""silver arrow"" editions. They are removeable hardtops."

I believe MB was on the lifetime transmission fluid lie by the end of W140 production too, so make sure it is changed by maybe 50-60K miles...a tranny one one of these has to run 5K."

I've had mine for over a year now. In that time I've had a couple of $90 oil changes (8 qts synthetic, I'm too lazy to do it myself and I have the 'I live in an apartment' excuse), and a 60K mile service (I did it early becaus of age), which came to $600 or so, and included maintenance of a sticky gear in the starter. The starter issue (sometimes you'd have to turn the key a couple times to get it to recognize you were trying to start it) has been my only repair. It's been a very reliable car. A super-pristine lower mileage C43, and by that I mean one I would consider nice, should be 18-20K,"

There is a small front trunk which I saw opened, pretty tiny really... with no rear trunk or behind seat room one would be pressed to go somewhere for the weekend in one of these. The overall shape looks even better in person but I think it would be prettier with a matching color airblade. Of course, since the blade is carbon fibre that means you have to get a black car b/c painting it over would be a crime. The headlights are some of the best I have ever seen. There were several suede loaferedferrari owning types in the showroom drooling over it and asking questions. Awesome car overall"

The good:
- The interior is nicest ever on a Saturn and is a million years better than a G6
- It's got clean styling and is somewhat distinctive

The bad:
- No 4 cyl option
- Inflated price due to no 4 cyl option
- Front fascia is a little bug eyed and love it or hate it
- Rear looks like a current gen Status sedan

It's not the class leading world beater that the General's loyalists claim but it's a major step up for Saturn."

I don't it will be any more or less popular than the old model, from a visual standpoint. It is generic enough that it will probably gain as many admirers as it loses.."

At first I thought it might have been this secretary's daughter driving her Mom's car or something, but then I found out that the secretary's car just ended up needing a cost-prohibitive amount of maintenance/repair work done.

So I'm guessing she dumped it for the Saturn. Overall I think it's a nice looking little car, although I still think it looks an awful lot like a facelift done to a 2001 Stratus. This one was a nice dark blue and had the 3.6. It also had that interesting burnt-orange/brownish looking leather interior. That interior color is interesting. Something about it just seems kinda high quality and almost a bit nostalgic, like something you might find in a 1953 Cadillac convertible.

Don't think you'll be seeing that in one of VW's ""Oh Sh*t"" commercials."
28,2006-11-03T17:50:25+00:00,lemko,...saw a white Chevrolet Colorado work truck with a Reading body that appeared to have dual rectangular sealed-beam headlamps in place of the regular composite lights. I find it strange that GM would use sealed-beam units in this truck and go through the extra expense of tooling the sockets and bezels to accept them. It didn't look like somebody's home-made attempt. It kind of reminded me of what Chrysler did with its 1957 cars for states in which quad headlamps were not yet legal.

The only things like I've said before that are missing is RWD, and the Bose studio 5.1 surround sound system. 350 hp. wouldn't hurt either. I remember back in the early 90's Cadillac was a leader in horsepower, now they have slipped behind the eight ball in that area. Hope fully GM will get it's mojo back and startbeing very competitive once again in that area. GM, needs to dump all supercharging and either go to turbocharging or use modern engine technology plus increase displacement to make the base V-8 have atleast 400 hp. I think a new modern OHC Northstar, needs to hit the shelf here in the very near future.

Which early '90s was this? The LS400 had 250hp and the Q45 was around 310hp in 1989 (the 276hp rating was an artifact of the Japanese market), while Cadillac had nothing better than a 200hp pushrod V8 as late as 1992."

48,2006-11-05T23:13:16+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Drove a new Sebring at the Boston Auto Show yesterday. Gotta admit, it is a handsome car on the exterior and the interior was well done. The one I drove had the 2.7 which was peppy and the car itself was very tight (solid). I'd put it on par with the excellent Fusion triplets and even the Saturn Aura. Made the G6 and ESPECIALLY the Malibu look like outdated clunklers.

Also, checked out most of the new 07's so I can't narrow any sighting down to just one car since I saw all of them! But some of the new models that really impressed:

Mitsu Outlander - Ton of effort there. Very impressive.

Acura MDX - The concept kinda gave me a cold shoulder, but the finished product came oout awesome. I want one.

Ford Edge - seem well built and competitive. The Lincoln nose ruins the look IMO.

Honda CRV- The nose is fine. The interior is top notch. They'l sell a ton of them.

Some of the most impressive current offerings:
- Infiniti M
- Toyota RAV4
- Lexus LS and GS
- Mercedes. These guys are coming back with a vengence. Outstanding build quality and paint quality. AMG's abound there...
- Honda Ody Touring
- Mazda MX-5 H/T
- Acura RDX, same scenario I had with the MDX. Good job.
- Best of all, the new Tundra was there. One of them and it was HUGE! Pricing was unavailable, but this one matched the Titan and the domestics on a lot of fronts.

Outside the show, on the way home, I spotted 2 new GL450's, a couple of Volvo R's, 2 Acura RDX's, a bunch of new CRV's and RAV4's, 2 Habenero Red Civic Si's, a couple of Honda Fit's and FJ cruisers on all sorts of colors. It was a great day for car spotting, that's for sure."

I suspect they sharpened the looks to get a male audience (like Toyota tried with the 2002 Camry)...when you try too hard, you won't meet the exact goal.

26,2006-12-27T14:25:36+00:00,gsemike,I'll second your opinion on the Nitro. What are they trying to do with it? Maybe it's supposed to be retro with more up to date cues injected than a PT or HHR?
27,2006-12-27T14:30:56+00:00,gsemike,"I haven't spotted it yet, but I just downloaded a little video podcast of the new Altima coupe that will be available this summer. It's going to be interesting to see how it goes.

They're going after the market of the Solara, Accord coupe and Monte Carlo, but the car will be more aggresive than any of them. The silouhette is very close to the G35 coupe and the only sheetmetal shared with the sedan will be the hood.

When I see the other coupes, they seem like retirement cars to me (unless they're pimped). They're for people that equate sportiness with 2 doors but still want that upright seating position and usable backseat. It will be very interesting to see how a coupe of this size with more sporting intentions fares."

Outlooks was very nice, solid, but awful visibility with wide pillars and a high rear hatch. 2nd and 3rd row seats were uncomfortable as well. Steering and ride, plus engine and trans, all quite impressive.

G6 was not nearly as impressive dynamically, but had great visibility for a convertible. So it was the exact opposite.

Mercedes R-Class seem to be all over Phoenix, Scottsdale and Mesa, for some reason they're all black. My wife says they don't look expensive enough to be Benzes. I think she's right, an E-class wagon looks a lot classier.

Audi Q7 I can't wrap my head around the concept of an ugly Audi but I'm not the only one, the Q7 seems to be a pretty rare bird. IMO it's the least good looking of the Cayenne/Toureg family. To my eyes the Toureg is the best looking.... go figure.

In the non-CUV category I saw a couple of new 328i coup[es and a convertible that was probably a 335ci. They look just as good as the photos suggest. BMW is moving away from Banglization and back to clean, understated but handsome styling.. Hooray!"

Or you could get a frame-off restored D from DMCH for $45. Even has a warranty! :O ) Or $75 if you went to D1 in Cali. OF you don't mind doing a little recondtioning you can find a pretty good one in the upper teens and make it into a very nice driver.

Also, there is a DeLorean that has an Infiniti engine, not the G35 though. And there is one with a 350 too. Pretty nice setup the guy has!"

I am all for stuffing modern drivetrains in all sorts of quirky but underpowered older cars like DMCs, VW things, Scouts (there are a few with LS1s!), volvo 240s etc...

Of course you can get a great modern car for $30-40k but that's not really the point. I am imagining a unique headturner like a DMC with the practicalilty to drive on a regular basis. Much more of a fun car than a real competetitor."

Most people don't realize the PRV in the D is a good reliable engine - it's a Volvo engine for pete's sake! :O )

You can get upgrades from DMC in Texas that will produce 245 horses for the DeLorean, which to me is great! The Stage III will crank out over 300hp!

That's what I plan on doing to mine!

The Pacifica looks round and bloated, while the Outlook is boxy and chiseled.

Basically:

* the Pacifica looks like a minivan
* the Outlook seems more like a tall wagon
* the Mazda6 looks more like a sports wagon

I actually think the Outlook resembles the Ford Freestyle more, i.e. a boxy but tall wagon:

The key is exactly the same as used in VW (the rectangle switchblade key) except it has a Bentley logo on it.


The tranny shifter pattern plate looks similar to ones in a VW or Audi.

It's kind of disappointing whenb you're spending that much dough on a car.

48,2007-03-16T18:33:23+00:00,ateixeira,"Guess so. They never got rid of the Tribute, so the CX7 and CX9 sandwiched the old MPV.

Got a $25 certificate (gift card) offer from Mazda so I may go drive a CX9 soon.

Yup.. it was a KY State Police vehicle.. :surprise:"
0,2007-03-16T22:05:32+00:00,boomchek,GMC Acadia in white. A very nice looking SUV imo. I think GM's styling is sorta getting back on track. It would be nice if their reliability would do the same.
1,2007-03-19T13:12:49+00:00,lemko,The Philadelphia city police have a few Dodge Charger cruisers. They are really cool-looking police cars. The other police cars are mostly Crown Victorias and Impalas.
2,2007-03-19T14:00:43+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a 3 series coupe on my way in. Looks much better than the sedan, IMO.

3,2007-03-19T15:13:20+00:00,fintail,"Not brand new, but yesterday I saw a MB C32 AMG wagon. Yeah, something that was never sold here. I am sure it was just a crafty rebadge, but it was well done - all the right badges, exhaust tip, etc. Or maybe somehow someone brought one in?

I also saw a couple of Ferrari 430s, in the morning rain."
4,2007-03-19T20:55:05+00:00,teds1,"Drove for a while next to a silver Phantom, single woman driving it alone... usually they have chaufeuer and a grey haired plutocrat in the back.

Also a Vanquish pulled up next to me at one point, pretty rare.

Finally we saw a purple cayman S. That car looks good in almost every color even purple."
5,2007-03-20T13:57:38+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a Fit yesterday, and then a Suburban this morning with a broken tail light (already?). :sick:"
6,2007-03-22T16:58:26+00:00,lemko,"...spotted a heavily customized new Corvette modified to resemble a '53 'Vette. It was white with a black top, had a red interior, the rocket-like taillights and a front end with sunken headlamps with gravel covers and a toothy chrome grille. You had to see it!"
7,2007-03-22T17:29:07+00:00,ateixeira,See those a lot lately.
8,2007-03-22T18:45:54+00:00,kyfdx,"Yup.. me too.. Also saw an RDX, today.. in white.."
9,2007-03-22T19:25:21+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Saw one of those in black today. Parked next to it was a new TL-S, 6-spd also in black."
10,2007-03-22T20:49:12+00:00,teds1,"I also just saw a TL-S, I had forgotten they were coming out but I noticed a good looking black TL with smoked rear lenses and quad exhaust pipes, and lo and behold that is what is was. If TLs were anything but front wheel drive I would really consider one."
11,2007-03-23T00:28:48+00:00,boomchek,I think there's a company that does that. IMO it's kinda ugly.

That car is ridiculous"
13,2007-04-03T00:46:32+00:00,boomchek,"Sat in the new MB CL coupe. Very nice car, love its lines.

Suzuki XL7: Looks nicer in pictures than in person. Really odd proportions to it, especially the overhangs.

New Mitsu Lancer: nice outside, ho hum interior

Will go back to see more when I have some more time."
14,2007-04-03T01:01:16+00:00,fintail,Heh...I sat in that same CL. Lovely thing indeed.
15,2007-04-03T01:17:52+00:00,fintail,"Oh yeah, not a totally new car...but when I went down to the gas station to put some expensive fuel in the beast, I pulled up alongside this Ford. I had my phone, so I snapped a pic:



The guy left the door open when he went in to pay! I think the car belongs to a local high end lot, though."
16,2007-04-04T00:06:49+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a pair of new Elantras....

Then a pair of new Auras.

Then a pair of new Fords, but one Escape and one Edge, not the same model."
17,2007-04-04T07:11:12+00:00,boomchek,Did you drive down here for the show?

Seeing one of these in your rear view mirror is unsettling."

They do look more intimidating than Crown Vics. :surprise:

22,2007-04-04T20:09:34+00:00,boomchek,"Your a dedictated car nut, to drive down for the auto show.

I'm going to go this week for the third time, cause when Iu worked there I didn't have too much time mto see stuff, and when I went with my fiancee, it was a quick walk as well."
23,2007-04-04T20:46:43+00:00,fintail,"I made it up in just a little over 2 hours, it wasn't too bad. The E55, with fast-ish highway driving, city traffic, and 25 minutes of border waste time on the way back still averaged 23 mpg, too.

IMO the Vancouver show is better than the Seattle show (they let you sit in more high end cars in Van), it's a nice day trip. I've gone to it for years, as once I didn't have to really travel to attend."

26,2007-04-05T14:28:25+00:00,ateixeira,Took me a while to see an Edge on the road. I still think I've only seen a total of 3 or 4.
27,2007-04-05T14:29:58+00:00,teds1,Is it just me or is it tough to tell the new LS from the ES Lexus at a glance? Both are vast improvements from their last version but I don't find the overall shapes and details different enough. Whatever Lexi (?) aren't my thing anyway
28,2007-04-05T14:31:05+00:00,ateixeira,"The new ES looks much better than the outgoing one, which had those pulled-back eye lids.

Nothing wrong with a family resemblance."
29,2007-04-05T16:19:12+00:00,lemko,...champagne-colored GMC Arcadia on Rising Sun near Comly at lunchtime.
30,2007-04-06T00:32:39+00:00,boomchek,"You're not the only one. I have to do a double take to check which model I'm looking at.

Either way both the ES and LS have much better styling than the outgoing models."
31,2007-04-06T04:13:36+00:00,boomchek,"for some brochures, and to have a look at everything I didn't get a chance to see while working.

I was surprised by the GMC Acadia SUVs. Very well finished and equipped for the price. They even have digital control panel for the back seats with climate control and audio controls.

I noticed many new cars these days have a cheap feel to them. Door handles feel cheap and flimsy, interior plastics rmind me of those on the old hot wheel/matchbox gas station/parkade playsets. You tap on them and feel a hollow sound.

Saw the new VW Jetta wagon. I thought it was a Saab 9-3 wagoin at first because the angles and propotions are very similar, but it was the Jetta. I like the previous gen better in terms of looks.

Audis had top noitch interiors as always, very well finsihed, and laid out. I played around with their MMI (Audi's iDrive) because the stereo was on, and I still don't know why high end manufacturers can't just have simple controls for things like the stereo and climate.

New X5 was sweet too in and out. Once again my fav SUV out there.

Couple Hyundais that caught my eye: the Accent and the Azera. The Accent has very stylish lines to it for a subcompact, has that euro minicar flair to it. If I'd be in the market for the cheapest new car, I'd probably get the hatchback.
They had a silver Azera there, I think they only look good in black.

Other than that nothing much else excites me because we get many 1 or 2 year old trade ins on the lot at work, so I usually get to see and drive them at work. Currently we have an 06 RX8, 03 E500, SL55AMG, had an 05 LS430.

And surprisingly Kia wasn't at the show at all."
32,2007-04-06T11:09:54+00:00,guss,"the Gmc Acacia and Saturn Outlook at the Philly show and was also impressed. Although the price climbs pretty quickly when you start adding options, I thought the bare bones Outlook was a decent deal.

I saw a VW Eos pulled over to the side of the highway, she(of course) may have been trying to figure out how to get the top down because it was one of the first nice days around here."
33,2007-04-06T14:58:00+00:00,stever,Did you see the Volvo?
34,2007-04-06T15:19:47+00:00,british_rover,I see about a dozen LR2s outside my office. :surprise:
35,2007-04-06T15:30:25+00:00,chuck1959,"I noticed that too. What I saw driving past me I thought the LS until it past and the I noticed it was an ES, surprised me, That's what I get for missing an auto show!"
36,2007-04-06T17:20:09+00:00,teds1,"It was just a matter of time but I saw one of these today. Looked good.

Also those new Acadia things aren't bad looking either, I saw a few of them recently.

Hitting the NYIAS this afternoon... so pumped!"

38,2007-04-06T23:51:47+00:00,boomchek,"No, the Vancouver Auto Show didn't have that Volvo here.

Saw the new C30 though, neat little car. Chick car."
39,2007-04-07T19:05:01+00:00,ateixeira,"No kidding, the local dealer had just one AWD model in stock and it was $42k after discounts. :surprise:"
40,2007-04-09T13:52:27+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Well the wife and I visited Chicago for the weekend (what a beautiful city) and there were car sightings a plenty the entire weekend.

My imppressions:
Range Rover central: There were more RR and RRS there than I have seen in my entire life.

BMW 3-series were the car of choice, from regular 328's to 335i sedans and coupes. I don;t know if I was seeing things or not, but I thought I saw a new bodystyle coupe with quad exhaust pipes (new M3 sighting? :surprise: ) Sure sounded like it...

Up the street from the hotel was an Infiniti store that had a window display with some exotics (tradeins I think) and they Bentley GTC vert and a gorgeous Saleen S7. They also had an SLR Mercedes.

There were many more sightings, but these were probably the coolest. Even more beautiful than the cars was the Chicago Library with the gigantic petina'd copper forms looming from the roof. Can't wait to go back. :shades:"
41,2007-04-09T16:32:04+00:00,guss,"$42K For a Eos. :confuse: I thought it was carrying on the line of the Rabbit convertible/ Cabriolet. At that price were talking more Mercedes CL K.

Funny thing is, I thought it looked a bit like a 2 door Ford Escort."
42,2007-04-11T18:38:03+00:00,lemko,...a black 2007 Nissan Sentra. Sentras aren't as common as Altimas despite being lower priced.
43,2007-04-11T19:28:27+00:00,kyfdx,"You'll start seeing a lot of them... We rented from Alamo at the PHX airport last week.. They had a dozen of them, still with temporary tags (which is why I didn't take one of them)."

I saw a new Escape, the front end looks too much like the Explorer."
47,2007-04-13T12:49:15+00:00,lemko,...silver BMW X3 this morning.
48,2007-04-13T12:50:20+00:00,anythngbutgm,but I saw a Subaru SVX on the way to work this morning. Remember those?
49,2007-04-13T13:48:27+00:00,ateixeira,"Yep, full canopy and all. You can open the windows in a down pour and not get the interior wet. paisan had one.

Too bad, it was a car before its time. The idea of an upscale AWD touring coupe just came too early.

Now that the SUV boom is pretty much over, a lot of those buyers are getting AWD sedans, the SVX would have offered a nice alternative.

I guess you can get an A5 Quattro soon enough. :shades:"
0,2007-04-13T16:08:35+00:00,kyfdx,"I think the SVX's biggest problem was the price... Along with the Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4, it was about $10K higher than anything else that the dealer had on the lot...

It would be like Mitsu or Subaru selling a vehicle for $50K today.. It would be a tough sell.. Just ask Honda about the NSX... :surprise:"
1,2007-04-14T05:23:52+00:00,giancarlo51,"New cars galore around Seattle:

...a blue Acura TL Type-S was tailgating me this morning, looks even better in person (the photos of the blue one at the acura site does not do justice)

...new black MDX - also much better looking in person

...black MB S550 parked by Safeco Field, UGLY [non-permissible content removed] rims, but otherwise great design

...souped up black MB CL600 with black rims, not the way I like my 100K+ cars"
2,2007-04-16T16:57:39+00:00,andre1969,"about a week ago, but forgot to post. On the Balt-Wash Parkway in Maryland, near BWI Airport, I saw a Nissan X-trail. Are these things being sold in the United States now? I wasn't under the impression that they were.

And Maryland seems kinda far from the border to be seeing something that might be offered in Canada or Mexico. Although once I did see a Chrysler Intrepid at a local movie theater parking lot."
3,2007-04-16T17:14:01+00:00,stever,"I don't think they are sold here - just in Canada and Mexico (and Japan). We may get the Qashqai here in the States (now on sale in the UK) instead of the X-Trail.

Nissan X-Trail (we want it!)

I'd take the Bonavista Edition one myself."
4,2007-04-16T17:29:49+00:00,ateixeira,I bet it was Canadian. We're not that far from Canada here in MD.
5,2007-04-16T17:57:01+00:00,fintail,"Bentley Continental GTC, in black"
6,2007-04-17T10:59:01+00:00,guss,"a Kia Rondo, the little mini-van thing. I am a Mazda fan, but I liked the look of the Rondo better than the Mazda 5. It was a little more car like with the regular rear doors."
7,2007-04-18T16:09:53+00:00,ateixeira,"Sliders are very handy, though. Wider opening, less space.

I saw my first Mazda CX9 out on the road. Looks good.

Also saw my first Dodge Stratus. That looks a bit cartoonish, with very exaggerated ""styling"" features."
8,2007-04-19T02:27:15+00:00,fintail,"I saw a Saab 97-X today. I see more new Bentleys than I see these ""Saabs"". What a disaster."
9,2007-04-19T04:46:52+00:00,boomchek,"What's funny about badge engineered cars is that usually in the ads they claim they were designed and engineered from the ground up for (insert car brand here) customers who demand more.

Ummm, no they were desgned to be your run of the mill car/truck, with interchangeable panels so that it could be adopted to 5 different brand names out there."
10,2007-04-19T13:58:41+00:00,gagrice,"I rarely see a Saab or a Bentley of any type in San Diego. You must live in an affluent neighborhood. All we have down here are Mercedes, BMWs and a load of lifted PU trucks and SUVs. If you see one of these let us know."
11,2007-04-19T15:40:04+00:00,ateixeira,"Coupe, pulled right in front of me in traffic today.

Also saw an RD-X this morning.

Last night I was with my wife and walked by a parked Ford Edge. I still think it's big outside, small inside."
12,2007-04-19T16:06:13+00:00,fintail,"And in the case of the Saab, being little different from the clones that cost a lot less. That vehicle is old-school GM thinking at its finest."
13,2007-04-19T16:07:50+00:00,ateixeira,I saw the Dub Edition 9-7x and NYIAS and had to just laugh. This is not what the Saab founders had in mind. :sick:
14,2007-04-19T16:27:34+00:00,lemko,...saw a Subaru Tribeca at lunchtime today.
15,2007-04-19T17:18:56+00:00,ateixeira,"They're common around me. There's one at my kid's school that parks there every day (must be a teacher's) and two here in the garage at work.

The 08 is far more conventional looking:"

Go north to Rancho Santa Fe. I used to drive through there all of the time. The less fortunate families only have one Bentley."
17,2007-04-19T20:26:59+00:00,gagrice,The last time I was up there Hale Bopp was flying over looking for Heaven's Gate cult members. You are right that would be the place to spot them.

19,2007-04-19T20:49:48+00:00,ateixeira,"Nope.

It's actually the Saabeca, i.e. the stillborn Saab 9-6x project.

FHI was developing a clone for Saab to sell, and when GM decided to sell its shares of FHI to Toyota, that stalled the project.

They recycled everything, the headlights are identical to ones from a test mule of the Saab 9-6x.

So basically Subaru is selling what would have been the Saabeca. I guess the good thing is that it cost them nothing to develop because they had already developed it!"
20,2007-04-19T20:57:15+00:00,kyfdx,"Wow... is that a big improvement, or what?"
21,2007-04-20T00:07:15+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Letting Subaru go was the best thing GM has done in the past 30 years...

I also saw the new Tribeca in NY. It's an improvement, definitely. The new WRX sedan is awesome as well."
22,2007-04-20T00:22:15+00:00,andre1969,That's one pretty impressive facelift on the Tribeca! It's nice to see that Subaru can react quickly when they have to.
23,2007-04-20T13:03:08+00:00,guss,"It's nice to see Subaru can admit to a mistake and make the appropriate changes.

Now all they need is a retrofit kit for the Tribeca's previously sold."
24,2007-04-20T13:38:33+00:00,ateixeira,"Well, like I said, they already had a 2nd design for the Saab 9-6x, so it wasn't so much a reaction. They just finished development of that clone, and swapped the badge.

The grille does look like it could be in the Chrysler family, but I wouldn't say it looks like one overall (just the grille):"
25,2007-04-20T16:53:18+00:00,lemko,...spotted a silver Chevrolet SSR at the Sunoco station on Rising Sun and Tyson as I was filling up my Seville. It's a nice day and the driver had the SSR's top down. Looks like a fun ride albeit impractical as a truck.
26,2007-04-20T20:06:35+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I got to drive one a few years ago when I put my S2000 away for the winter. Some guy was putting his away at the same garage. My impressions:

It's fun in a 1970 MonteCarlo kinda way. Big, heavy and ponderous. I'd even go so far as to say it handled about as well as this ""familiar"" concept...


And that's being polite. :blush: Power was there, but the thing weighed like 3 tons so it was strained, big time...

Edit: couldn't be driven in the rain because it had a water leak. He had to tape off the ""hole"" when it got washed."
27,2007-04-20T20:30:32+00:00,navigator89,"A deep blue Lamborghini Gallardo, an orange Ferrari 360 Modena, then a light blue 360 Modena, two Flying Spurs in white, two Continentals in white and red. Also two LS460s in greyish green. Two 911 Turbos as well, one old generation one new. Old one was neon blue, the new one was Guards Red like in the IL road test. Also a few new Cayennes.

Overall a terrific day!"
28,2007-04-22T20:53:05+00:00,andys120,"They aren't new but they're pretty rare even here in Saab Country and yesterday I saw TWO Saabarus, that's about a year's worth.

I've seen a couple of Dodge Nitros lately which I thought were nice looking for what they are."
29,2007-04-23T01:38:00+00:00,fintail,"Lots of nice new stuff out here today...I saw a Bentley Flying Spur, a couple of Continental coupes, a ""Bluetec"" badged E-class, an E63, a retractable roof BMW 3er, a couple Ford Edge, and a Hyundai Veracruz (VERY derivative of the CRV)"
30,2007-04-23T11:13:19+00:00,andys120,"I stopped by the BMW Store yesterday to ogle the new Three-series coupe and convertible. Needless to say both are gorgeous.

I personally am pleased to see BMW return to their classic styling themes with these cars.
They go right to the top of my wish list, in fact the 3er coupe and cab are better looking than the more expensive but overly Bangleized 6- series IMO.

Then there's the Z4s which by all accounts are sweet driving cars but are seriously ugly and if you thought the Roadster was ugly, wait til you get a load of the Z4 Coupe. :sick:"
31,2007-04-23T13:29:40+00:00,bumpy,"This one?


I like it. Reminds me a bit of the original 240Z. If it wasn't designed and built by Germans, I'd actually consider buying one.

The Z3 coupe was a bona fide uggo:"
32,2007-04-23T15:19:48+00:00,teds1,"Haven't posted in a while so I have a list.
First, the NYIAS was great. I am not gonna post any cars from the show as sightings but I will say the R8 was probably the most popular car there, the $30k V8 Hyundai Lux Sedan is going to be very significant, The Z4 Coupe is great looking but pretty spartan inside, The Lambo model was smoking hot next to two white Murcielagos, The Mazdaspeed 3 was my choice for reasonable buy, the ageing viper had a raaaaaad paint job (look it up), and unfortunately, Subaru really butchered the WRX.

Other than that I actually rode in a UNIMOG in mexico (how rare are they?)
Saw the usual complement of Maybachs, Phantoms and Flying spurs around my office
Saw another GTC parked top down in front of a restaurant
Saw two CL 550s... kinda gangsta
DB7, Gallardo (black with smoked taillights), old model Z06 with custom exhaust, and waaaaay too many people in convertibles with the top up. Come on it's spring, mess your hair up!

Oh and by the way the Z3 Coupes were ridculously awesome... sorry bumpy"
33,2007-04-23T16:45:08+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a CR-V LX today. Odd to see them with steelies and so bare-bones.

Saw not one but TWO HHRs. I rarely see those.

Drove by a brand new Civic LX. Those wheel covers are still the bolt-on type, so I guess losing them is hard."
34,2007-04-23T19:16:48+00:00,andys120,"I think the Z3 coupe was pretty good looking compared to the Z4, not a beauty by any means but acceptable, at least to me."
35,2007-04-23T19:28:44+00:00,guss,"I never got the flame surfacing either. The Z3, in convertible form anyway, was tolerable. The Z4 is just weird."
36,2007-04-23T19:30:45+00:00,kyfdx,"I think the Z4 looks are improved in coupe form, something that I can't say about the Z3..

The car is normal, but the paint job (besides being a shade of PINK) was a neat reflective Mother of Pearl. It shimmered as I went past. I was nore of a White with a Pink underlay.

Plus, with Saab you got 2 free years of service!

A lot of people will see a 2000 MY S class and think it is new...as it is different from an 06 model in just some trim detail.

the car I saw could use larger wheels.

Am I the only one who thinks the new Lincoln nomenclature is idiotic?"
21,2007-05-10T16:57:28+00:00,ateixeira,"No. I'm a car guy and I have to think about it each time.

The worst part is they had a Mark Seven, Mark Eight, but these are Em Kay Ex, Em Kay Zee. So there's that as well.

For MKX, I try to think of the X as ""crossover"", and that helps. The Z is for Zephyr in MKZ, I supposed.

Porsche has the same issue with the Cayenne and Cayman, they names are just too close."

I quite agree, I get them mixed up too. Cayenne is a dumb name, Porsche should've called it the Dakar and the Cayman (a small crocodille for cryin' out loud) should be the 987."

Also I forgot that a few weeks ago I saw a Campagna T-Rex on Broadway. Wierdest thing was the color, Beige. Who gets an outrageous sportbike/trike thing and paints it beige?

I have seen a few Maybach 57S s near my office whcih spiced up the usual uber limo blend for a while. I can't fathom why one would buy a 57S but at least three guys who work on Park avenue did."

New Santa Fe (pretty car actually, I would consider it if I like suvs)
Customized Prowler

Slowly driving down Broadway reving their engines, a fly yellow Murcielago with 4 pipe tubi exhaust, smoked rear lenses and matching yellow rims. It was followed by a 360 modena spyder with the same color treatment.... Holy crap that sounded great!

My car is dark grey, a person suggested that I paint the spokes of the wheels to match the car, and leave the polished lips as-is...but it's not worth the time and expense to me. I think the AMG monoblock is one of the most timeless wheel designs out there...mine are virtually unmarked, so I will leave them be.

I've never seen a Lusso on the road. At least it's not a garage queen. I can be jealous and respectful at the same time."

I bet fintails can really be rusty around your neck of the woods...those cars can rust into pieces on salted roads. If it has rusted around the lights, there are almost certainly other issues."
45,2007-05-14T19:59:43+00:00,british_rover,I see it all the time but I have never seen the owner. It is always either parked some where out of the way or going the opposite direction that I am going. I guess it can't be in too bad a shape if it is driving that much. The interior is spotless. The leather looks so good it has to have been recovered.

47,2007-05-14T22:43:01+00:00,lemko,Cool! I had my 1989 Cadillac Brougham out yesterday and today! These old cars really stand out in a sea of Camcords and anonymous soccer-mommy mobiles.

These old cars might not be as trouble free as moderns, but they are more enjoyable, and are a cheap vice to have.

6,2007-05-15T15:21:16+00:00,fintail,"That looks like the 95-02 model with a new style front end, and those lame cliched fender vents. The Brits love to make aftermarket facelifts like that, I have seen them for Mercedes as well."
7,2007-05-15T15:28:26+00:00,british_rover,"Yeah you got it for the most part.

That is a 95-02 Range or P38 with a 2003-2005 Mark III Range Front end.

The side vents are off a Range Rover sport as are the wheels. The wheels are 20 inch stormer wheels that were limited production only item last year but are now a 1,000 dollar option on top of the 4,000 dollars you paid for regular 20 inch wheels. So 5,000 dollars for ""special"" 20 inch wheels oh and they don't credit you back the cost of the 19 inch wheels that the Sport comes standard with. :surprise:

Talk about profitablity.

Those vents on the sport are actually functional or at least the passenger side one is. THe passenger side vent is used as the air intake for the engine. That way you get nice cool air from outside the hood and water/dust has a harder time getting into the intake track."

10,2007-05-15T16:40:01+00:00,british_rover,The rear bags tend to fail first on those vehicles. I don't remember why.
11,2007-05-15T16:44:25+00:00,ateixeira,"They must be expensive to fix, because people drive around on them like that. It's pathetic! You get a luxury SUV and then can't keep it running properly. I'm sure it's not even safe. :mad:"
12,2007-05-15T17:26:59+00:00,fintail,"Oh, that wagon sounds bad. I have seen W140 S class with W220 front ends, W220 with W221, W210 E class with W211 front ends, etc. Well, I have seen them in magazines.

BMW should bring up a slander case for that M6 decal :sick:"

15,2007-05-15T20:34:38+00:00,fintail,"Not a new model, but today I saw a W211 E55 AMG in a beautiful kind of steel blue-grey color. I have never noticed that shade before. I wish my car would have been made in that color."
16,2007-05-15T20:36:11+00:00,fintail,"Indeed...that's why you always want to have records and/or a clean bill of health when buying a higline car that is even a couple years old. They seem to be double damned...either owned by rich people who don't care, or by people who can't afford to keep the car up. Luckily most high end makes have enthusiasts, so many cars are kept up."
17,2007-05-16T13:48:31+00:00,teds1,Well I don't mind the side vents on the rovers since they act as exhaust snorkels and not some kind of non functioning naca duct. I believe that it really started in the modern era with the M3 which had small tasteful vents behind the front fenders to differentiate it from 330s. Now of course with the everybody including the escalade sporting them it has gone too far. Notice on the new M3 it does not appear to be a vent anymore but a chrome strip.

36,2007-05-24T14:31:26+00:00,ateixeira,"Spotted a brand new, 2007 Sienna LE with power sliding doors....in my driveway!"
37,2007-05-24T19:07:27+00:00,lemko,"...I drove one - a new silver Chevrolet Impala! Geeze, I really like the car! Maybe I can get one as a replacement for my old '88 Buick Park Ave?

I was at the Cadillac dealer getting an oil change for my Seville STS when I spotted a beautiful new DTS in White Diamond that just caught my eye so much that I just had to ask the salesman for a closer look. I was getting that old ""this is my next car"" vibe looking at it until I was quoted a price of $55K. That brought me quickly crashing back to reality. If I has heard some more reasonable number, I know I would've traded my Seville. Good God, this car was as loaded as a DTS could get and the rich smell of new leather and wood trim was almost heavenly.

Maybe it's a good thing I didn't go for broke. I get such horrible buyer's remorse after I purchase a car. I'd have needed a 55 gallon barrel of Prozac had I gone through with it - at least for a week and then get over it."
38,2007-05-24T19:45:29+00:00,bumpy,"the rich smell of new leather and wood trim was almost heavenly.

Naah, that was the organic solvents melting a few of your brain cells.

39,2007-05-24T19:50:23+00:00,imidazol97,"Actually, Lemko, it's probably a scent added to the car to give exactly that effect on the consumer. I recall a news story somewhere about the art (science) of using scents to improve the products. Of course they cost. The higher priced the car, the more likely it had a quality scent package added as a consumer pheromone."
40,2007-05-25T19:02:35+00:00,kyfdx,"First, another new 328i convertible.. top down.. Just like the one on the brochure.. Platinum Bronze with tan interior (kinda boring).

Then... a new BMW M5.. Carbon black.. sheewwwwww!!!"
41,2007-05-26T01:59:22+00:00,boomchek,"A beautiful grey Lambo Muricelago driving on the highway beside me.

The vehicle, even though it's low and sleek looks massive compared to other cars probably due to it's wide rear end."
42,2007-05-26T02:42:27+00:00,fintail,I saw a black CL550 at the body shop where I was not getting my car back
43,2007-05-26T09:54:03+00:00,boomchek,What happened to your car? Did you smash it up?
44,2007-05-26T16:50:40+00:00,fintail,"It had a weird door ding in it when I bought it, only visible from certain angles. I thought it wouldn't matter to me...but as I am OCD, it eventually was driving me insane, so I took it in to be repaired. It's actually a complicated little bump that is part of a faint crease in the door skin about a foot long, that you have to be an inch from the car to spot - I did not notice it when I bought the car. So, it is at a high end local body shop as I know they do amazing work. The girl at the desk said it would be done yesterday, but the estimator guy says Tuesday. I went and visited the car yesterday...the work is done and paint is on, but it is not buffed and the trim is not replaced. No door handles on the driver's side...scary!

So, on the new car subject, there's a new silver Focus ZX5 sitting in my parking spot for a few more days! To be honest, it's not a horrible little car...it's very unrefined compared to the E55 of course, but it is well-assembled and quick enough. It feels like a Lexus compared to my last rental experience, a Kia Spectra that I am pretty sure was a car body on a riding lawnmower platform."
45,2007-05-27T03:02:21+00:00,fintail,"Maybe not brand new, but today I saw a Lambo Murcielago roadster, in a silver-grey color. The driver had it revved up high, it was loud.

I also saw about 20 new style S-class."
46,2007-05-27T16:26:30+00:00,fintail,"New style DTS, a very metallicy maroon color with a tan carriage top, whitewall tires, and chrome wheels. All it needed was a continental kit.

And about 3 minutes later I saw a ca. 1990 Riviera with a full continental kit. It was hideous."
47,2007-05-27T18:17:18+00:00,boomchek,"I don't really like the back/trunk lids on the new DTS. Seems too plain, like there's something missing. I like the previous ones better (2000-2006)"
48,2007-05-27T21:41:40+00:00,fintail,I just saw one of those new Scion xB replacements. Pretty it aint.
49,2007-05-29T01:59:44+00:00,fintail,"Today I saw a MB ML63 AMG, a Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano, an Aston DB9, and several new Suzuki XL7, which I think is a very odd design."
0,2007-05-29T06:46:48+00:00,boomchek,"The XLz look good with big rims, but the base models look really miserable for some reason.

Today saw a Gallardo in black. Same area where I saw the Muricelago a few days ago."
1,2007-05-29T12:24:31+00:00,lemko,"Geeze, the Caddy owners have extremely bad taste where you live. Fortunately, this stuff is becoming rare around me. I was looking at a tastefully appointed DTS in ""White Diamond"" for myself when took my Seville for an oil change and emmissions/inspection last week. Salesman left two messages on my answering machine while I was away this weekend."
2,2007-05-29T15:37:53+00:00,fintail,"I think it's an odd design. The headlights look to be taken from an anime character, and the things look like they are jacked up in the rear, like and old hot rod.

And you are right, lemko, there is some bad taste here. Heck, in the past I have spotted both a Sable (I actually see this one often) and of all things a Mercury Topaz with carriage tops, so maybe there's some bad old school thinking here. I would expect to find such taste in Florida or even around NYC, but not out west."
3,2007-05-29T18:25:10+00:00,anythngbutgm,"It is absolutely amazing how many of the new Camry's I see everyday. Those things must be flying off the lots. What's even more amazing is the amounts of older ones that don't seem to be declining in the least. So there must be a bunch of Newbee's out there who jumped into the Camry fray. Anyone know what kind of sales are conquest sales? Must be pretty impressive numbers.

Ford Edge sales seem to be picking up as well, see a lot more of those these days as well."
4,2007-05-30T03:24:59+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Spotted this car today.

Kid from the S2k club is selling it for his grandmother. In case anyone is looking :shades:

Also, saw a couple of new X5's on the way home today. Nice update. 3 series coupes and verts a plenty around here as well.

Oh, and saw a red NSX (non flip lights) and a few minutes later a beautiful Bentley GT coupe in blue. Wow."
5,2007-05-30T16:56:51+00:00,ateixeira,"Sedan, looks nice. :shades:"
6,2007-05-31T16:50:32+00:00,fintail,"I spotted a silver Bentley Continental GTC yesterday, and a dark red CL550 too, at the body shop.

Yes, I have my car back, but of course it has been a fiasco. They put a scratch on the lower boddy cladding, and when trying to buff it out, went through the paint. So now my car is being driven without this trim on one side while they fix it. I am pleased.

It was also about 90F here yesterday, and the AC in the car sucks. Yesterday was the first really hot day since I got the car...and I think I might have to make another warranty claim coming. I know MB AC usually isn't good, but this is much worse than in others I have experienced."
7,2007-06-01T01:37:47+00:00,boomchek,"Maybe your AC needs recharging. My AC works great, and starts cooling within about 2 minutes of the car starting in super hot weather. And my centre console has vents in it so it's great for colling down water bottle that's been sitting in the car all day.

I saw a Gallardo convertible today, baby blue color. For the past 2 weeks seems like I've been seeing a Lambo or Ferrari every day. I guess the nice weather brings them out."
8,2007-06-01T02:17:39+00:00,fintail,"Yeah I am going to drop by my indy mechanic next week and see what he thinks. Hopefully not a big deal. The air it puts out is cool-ish, but not like on the C43 or even the W126 that had over 180K miles on it.

Today I saw an E55 wagon, uncommon."
9,2007-06-01T12:59:59+00:00,lemko,...spotted a black Mercedes G55 AMG last night.
10,2007-06-02T21:06:32+00:00,fintail,"Yesterday when finally getting my car back up to spec, I saw a new E63 AMG sitting at the body shop. It must have had some cosmetic damage repaired, maybe from shipping...I looked the car over, and from the underside and brakes, it obviously had not been driven. However, it had a huge ding in the windshield, the size of a quarter at least."
11,2007-06-04T12:30:49+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Stopped by a Benz dealer over the weekend cause the wife wants an SLK, when I look over and what is sitting on the corner, a brand new CL63 in triple-black. Now, I absolutely hated the restyled nose when the pics first appeared on the net and in the magazines, but in person this thing looks just plain brutal. Especially in black, with the multi-spoke 19's (maybe 20's), the thing looks just plain evil.

The place also had on eof those new Z4 ""M"" hatches, and while it has better proportions than that ugly Z3 ""M"" Reebok sneaker looking thing, it was still just plain odd."
12,2007-06-05T01:56:28+00:00,imidazol97,Friday between Louisville/Nashville I saw a row of sports cars in identical colors snaking over the hills behind me. when they passed there were 10 burnt orange Corvettes all with Indianapolis 500 license plates issued by Indiana. They all pulled in at the Corvette Museum in Bowling Green next to the Corvette factory!
13,2007-06-05T12:05:56+00:00,lemko,"...silver Chevrolet Impala
...black Chrysler Sebring
...red Ford Edge"
14,2007-06-05T14:46:06+00:00,ateixeira,Saw two of these recently. They're still so rare that I was surprised to see them one after the other.
15,2007-06-06T13:29:27+00:00,andys120,"I saw the new Mitsu sedan parked at a mall, first opportunity to get a good look at one and surpisingly it looked good better than a Camcord.

It was a cool shade of medium blue and had nice edgy styling that didn't descend into weirdness."
16,2007-06-06T13:44:57+00:00,ateixeira,New G35 right behind a new 328i.
17,2007-06-06T14:14:06+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Yeah, I'm really digging the new Lancer as well. In GTS trim, I'd even go so far as to compare it to an Acura TSX than a Camcord. Mitsu really put the effort into the redesign."
18,2007-06-06T14:39:56+00:00,guss,"I saw my first Lancer on the street yesterday also. It was the definitely a base model in white. Still it looked surprisingly nice.

I thought it was a Mazda6 at first."
19,2007-06-12T21:59:48+00:00,fintail,"Today I have seen a Gallardo roadster, a STS-V, a SL55, a retractable roof 3er, and a weird new S550 that was white with a panorama roof, looked odd somehow."
20,2007-06-12T22:19:28+00:00,andys120,"I've seen a couple of new Miatas...er MX-5s, The new fender contour looks good and gives the car a little bit of 'Tude that the older designs didn't have.

Jeep Wrangler 4-doors are popping up a lot too. If you've ever had to sit in back of a 2-dr you'll know why .

Product planners at Chrysler must be smacking their heads wondering why they didn't think of that before. They look good too."
21,2007-06-13T16:53:59+00:00,ateixeira,"These look best from the front. From some rear angles they actually look a bit awkward.

That 3rd row must be tiny."
22,2007-06-13T20:24:10+00:00,british_rover,Some of the documentation with the car says that people over 5 foot 5 should not even try to use the back seat.
23,2007-06-14T14:45:21+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Sedan in a deep burgandy color. Nice.

A few new updated X5's and a Black M6 this morning. Couple of new Lancers, a slew of new Camry's as usual and I never really noticed just how many new Tacomas are out there!

Lessee, a couple of those new Avengers, a new Sebring convertible, one of those full size Hyundai SUV's that look like Lexus RX's and a couple of new CX-9's. :shades:"
24,2007-06-14T21:02:50+00:00,andys120,"I saw my first Jaguar XKR today, photographs do not do it justice. In the metal it has a sleef and potent look."
25,2007-06-18T01:10:25+00:00,fintail,"I saw a new style Unimog today. Weird thing, looks like it is 15 feet tall

- it was something like this"
26,2007-06-18T15:22:25+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Local Subaru dealers have the updated, restyled Tribeca. Looks good. Couldn't find any new Imprezas on the lots yet...

Wife and I stopped to check out the new Mazda CX-9. While it's not going to end up in our garage due to size (Our MDX is too much right now) it is quite a rig. I'm not really a fan of the slab sided CX-7, but this one is much more elegant.

Saw a bunch of new 3-series coupes and convertibles

Blast from the past: Sitting on the side of the highway was a red Dodge Daytona from the 90's?

Like this but no pop-up headlights...



And an absolutely stunning pewter Split-window Vette with the spinners."
27,2007-06-19T14:18:41+00:00,kyfdx,E63 AMG... in black of course..
28,2007-06-30T21:54:56+00:00,bumpy,"From the side and rear, it looks like something designed and built on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. And whose idea was it to put the side repeaters in the door?"
29,2007-06-30T22:27:11+00:00,british_rover,"European cars haver to have the side markers on the fender or door.

The LR3 is all about form following function. Every single thing on the car has a function and nothing is on the car that is not for function. That is why it only has one air vent on the passenger side.

The air vent draws in air for the engine and by mounting it on the side it improves wading depth. It also makes it easier to attach a snorkel. The engine only needs one vent so it doesn't get a non-functional one on the other side.

The slab sides and cab to the rear design mean that two 6 foot one tall adult can sit in the third row comfortably. Not other mid-sized SUV in the world can do that. Oh and with all the seats folded down there is nearly 100 cubic feet of cargo room."
30,2007-06-30T23:42:26+00:00,fintail,"Today there must have been a new Aston convention in town...I saw 5 (!) new style Aston Martins on the road today. 4 grey and silver coupes, and a red convertible. Also, a silver Ferrari F430 convertible."
31,2007-07-02T12:41:08+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I don't know if it's really for sale yet, I think we are still a ways away but guess what I spotted yesterday? Couple of hints:

- It's got a giant gaping opening fro a grill, A pentistar shape big enough to sallow a Kia Sephia

- Continued design lineage with it's bigger, more expensive siblings

- A huge wreath and crest in the center of said huge, gaping mouth(that was probably enough to give it away)

- A non-(V)elocity model

- It didn't have a Landau roof or wire wheels and was completely devoid of curb-feelers :P

Yup, a new CTS in Silver, and if I had not driven by it 3 times to confirm my claims I never would have believed it. It was parked in broad, morning daylight in the middle of Concord, MA. I don't know if it was an unplanned stop or not but my hunch tells me that it was strategically placed as this was pretty much one of THEE busiest roads through town. If I had my camera, I would have posted pics but I didn't. Sorry folks."
32,2007-07-02T19:46:34+00:00,ateixeira,"First on the roads, all black, in downtown DC. Only seen them at a dealer and on the auto show circuit up to now.

Talk about blind spots...."
33,2007-07-04T23:46:57+00:00,boomchek,"We did ride and drives this week in the Rogue. Neat little crossover. It will sell well.

Also we just got the Altima coupe. Nice car too."
34,2007-07-05T01:58:28+00:00,british_rover,"Rouge?

What is that. I haven't even heard of it. Or is that the US name of the Cube thing?"

36,2007-07-05T07:59:14+00:00,boomchek,"Thanks Steve, not many people heards about the car yet. It has a good price point and it should do well even though it's one of the smallest of the cute-utes."
37,2007-07-05T17:54:37+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw an Altima coupe out on the streets.

I really like it. Reminds me of the G35c, in a good way.

Plus it looks very distinctive from the Altima sedan.

Good job, Nissan."
38,2007-07-08T22:10:26+00:00,fintail,"I saw almost the entire new AMG lineup today. Of course, I was out dawdling around and stopped by the local MB dealer. It kills me what is optional on these cars, given their price point. Still, they were quite lovely, although white is the last color I would choose for an S63.

I think I want those E63 wheels and brake assemblies on my E55."
39,2007-07-09T00:56:55+00:00,british_rover,I saw a GL320 CDI at the auto show this afternoon. The local Mercedes club had a couple of cars from the local MB dealer on hand.
40,2007-07-09T01:25:24+00:00,stickguy,"I'm sure if you have enough money, the dealer would be happy to swap a set on for you."
41,2007-07-09T12:13:14+00:00,anythngbutgm,"A couple of streets over from me just brought home a Lambo Gallardo... I haven't bumped into him yet to ask how, but he may have won a lottery. We just had a 4th of July drawing, one of the best odds in history of winning 1 million smackaroos. May have a winner...

Also saw a couple of new Subaru Tribecas even though they're not as exciting."
42,2007-07-09T15:37:35+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, anything can be done with enough money, much more than I would want to spend.

Maybe eventually a set will be available used for cheap...barring any unforseen issues etc, I plan to keep my car for several years."
43,2007-07-09T17:20:47+00:00,fintail,"Today I saw a pearl white new-style DTS with a vinyl top, chrome wheels, gold trim, and white-and-yellow-wall tires. No continental kit, curb feelers, or RR grille.

On that note, yesterday I saw a 97-01 Camry with a vinyl top, it was ridiculous. Also, an early 90s Deville with the 'full Florida' treatment - top, grille, wires, continental kit, and all.

Speaking of the GL320 CDi, I also saw one of these yesterday. I could hear the diesel!"
44,2007-07-09T23:49:19+00:00,ateixeira,"Haven't seen many of these, but this weeked I spotted two of them."
45,2007-07-12T18:58:35+00:00,kyfdx,"Porsche Cayman S in light gray..

If I could get $70K for my first-born, I would be driving one of these... :surprise:"
46,2007-07-12T19:50:42+00:00,ateixeira,"OK, a Ford Five Hundred, totally pimped out. I'm talking billet aluminum grille, spinnaz, the works!

All that for an underpowered, relatively dull sedan."
47,2007-07-12T21:27:32+00:00,british_rover,"I sold a used one with 1,900 miles on it for 54,000 dollars or so."
48,2007-07-12T21:35:01+00:00,anythngbutgm,I'd step up to a base 911 for the same price and a much better gearbox... The Cayman gearbox fights back too much changing gears. It reminds me of the one in my Subaru.
49,2007-07-12T22:30:58+00:00,kyfdx,"I haven't driven a Cayman... Boxsters and 911s, but no Caymans...

But, just for the looks and the rarity.. I'll take the Cayman.. I don't lust after the 911..

So.. .. if I can get $54K for the kid... hmm.. things are looking up.."
0,2007-07-13T01:18:15+00:00,stickguy,"Saw a new style 5 series, in silver. Looked just like my BILs new one. Except for the bling wheels.

God awful things. Probably 22s, but the looked like giant pizza pans (round side out). It was terrible moving, probably even worse standing still.

And way to take one of the best ride/handling combos ever, and make it drive like a checker cab!"
1,2007-07-14T12:14:26+00:00,gsemike,"In the same parking lot, I saw a new MDX aqnd a new Veracruz.

The MDX is a mess. The color of the rear bumper cover did not blend well into the body paint at all and it just looked like a overdone mess. One thing I noticed is that there is a trend towards lips over the wheel wells that are very tall and flattended out. The MDX has it as does the Altima. I don't like it.

The Veracruz on the other hand looked quite nice. It looks to be as big as an Explorer with very nice flowing lines. Hyundai has really come a long way."
2,2007-07-16T00:17:33+00:00,fintail,"I saw 3 new CLK63s at the dealer today. Amusing that a car that bases at nearly 90K has navi as an option.

Also, an Altima coupe and about 20 new MDXs."

Thats Mercedes for you...

I just sold a LR2 to a guy that has a 2007 CLK550 with the full AMG package but no AMG badging thank god. He just likes the look of the AMG wheels and grill and doesn't care about the extra hundred something horsepower. There isn't any place to use it around here anyway."
4,2007-07-16T01:50:17+00:00,fintail,"The CLKs seem to get that package much more often than the sedans. I've only seen one E350 with that stuff.

I do like the E63 wheels, I think they'd look OK on my car.

This dealer also had an S550 loaded up with AMG package and many other toys, pushed the sticker to something like 115K."
5,2007-07-16T14:19:23+00:00,teds1,"I always see CLS s with the AMG trim package (even a badge)
I guess if it is factory it isn't as offensive"
6,2007-07-16T16:41:31+00:00,fintail,"It could be worse, but it could be better by not existing at all. AMG is now used as a trim package and a cash grab. I miss the old days when it was something really exclusive that you didn't see every day. I remember back in 1996 when I saw my first C36 in traffic, I took photos of it!"
7,2007-07-17T00:43:58+00:00,kyfdx,"..just because I can..

A base Cayman is pretty well equipped at $55K..they had 3 of them for around that MSRP. And, there was a well equipped Cayman S for $63K.. CHEAP!

The last time I stopped by this winter, all they had were loaded up S models for over $70K...

So, with my CR-V trade... hmmm..."
8,2007-07-17T01:19:04+00:00,british_rover,The regular Cayman is fine and I can't ever see spending over $70k to get the one we took in trade.
9,2007-07-17T14:10:51+00:00,ateixeira,"$63k is cheap?

That's roughly the balance on my beach condo mortgage.

So I can keep my Miata and drive it to the beach, or get the Porsche and drive to the beach and be homeless."
10,2007-07-17T14:13:23+00:00,british_rover,"Ahh but to be homeless with a Porsche at the beach...

I think I take the Porsche."
11,2007-07-17T14:16:25+00:00,kyfdx,"Yeah... I've been to the beach lots of times.. never needed a house. I've got one of those, already.."
12,2007-07-17T14:22:46+00:00,ateixeira,"I guess all things are relative, and if you were used to seeing prices in the $70s then low $60s seems ""cheap"".

That's my problem, though, I'm way too practical.

I got a 3 series convertible brochure. Tempting. But then I think of what else I could do for $50 grand plus. No way.

Maybe a used Elise for $20k or so. Have they dropped that far in price yet?"
13,2007-07-17T14:24:14+00:00,kyfdx,"Elise for $20K? Don't think so..

I'm with you on the 3-series convertible.. For $50K+, I'd probably get a.... CAYMAN"

Really... I need a Cayman..."

I look at the Cayman and think, that would look great as a roadster.

Plus, since when does the coupe cost MORE than the roadster? It should be the other way around.

Sure, it's more rigid, and that matters on the track, but how often on public roads will you exceed a Boxster S' capabilities? Plus, with the top down, you feel the experience a whole lot more. Better visibility, better sounds, immerse yourself in the drive.

I dunno, my Miata feels faster than it is because you become part of the environment around you. I guess I just like open air cars."

I think just the opposite.. I really like the look of the Cayman over the Boxster. I'm not sure of the price difference, but it's really small... The cars are within a couple thousand of each other.

I'll be honest... the chances of me tracking a $50K+ car are between slim and none.. But, it isn't about maximum capabilities... The chassis flex, noise, visibility, etc.. are completely different between a coupe and convertible.

I'd just rather have the coupe. (in this case, disregard visibility.. it isn't that great in the Cayman, either).

I'll be honest, again... The chances of me getting a Cayman are pretty slim... I'll have to wait until at least 2011, before a used one will drop into my price range.

First off, the car was already produced, so it's going to consume gas, whether that owner keeps it or sells it makes no difference. Even if it is totalled and the insurance company sells it.

Second, there will be an incredible waste of ENERGY to produce new glass, take the bends out of that sheetmetal, re-paint, fix, etc.

It's like that group that torched a bunch of Excursions when those came out. The fire alone caused more pollution than the trucks would have caused in their lifetime. The environment only suffered.

Who won? The car dealer. They cashed in on the insurance they had, and get this - they got MSRP! It created HUGE profits for a dealer selling those behemoths.

Law of unintended consequences takes over when stupidity reigns, and vandalism of any kind is just plain stupid.

This guy will probably take a check from insurance. They'll auction it off, someone will buy it cheap and fix it themselves, and keep driving it. This will not take an H2 off the roads.

It will help H2 suppliers that sell replacement parts, though.

My uncle has leased XK8s for the last 8 years and this year when his came off lease they wouldn't lease him another or renew his lease for some reason, he had to go to the new XK. They delivered it Sunday, and for a while we had both of them in the driveway, both in british racing green with tan tops. I got some great photos and you could really do a nice comparison.

He was bummed a bit as he really loved the old one and wasn't sold on the new XKs for several reasons (trunk space being cut in half was one of the major ones).

I on the other hand Looooove the new XK even though the old one was nice. I drove it around the neighborhood a bit and from what I can tell the car is much tighter and more coiled than the last version. The steering is more focused and the car seems more agile without losing it's substantial road feel. He is going to love it, he just doesn't know it yet.

48,2007-09-09T22:25:22+00:00,fintail,"I think at some angles the greenhouse can look kinda tall. And I don't like the star in the grille of the sport models, I am an old school MB person, and star in grille is for 2 door cars only. But, I do think this is a more proper design than the old C-class, which somehow seemed kind of immature to me.

If someone gave me a new S class, I would not decline it.

Today I saw TWO CLK 63 black series! One was at a MB stand at a car show, but the other was in a parking garage, driven by a nondescript looking young woman. I talked to her about it...she said it was her dads, and she didn't know anything about it other than it was fast and too expensive. I could deal with one of those...

The MB display at the car show had all the new AMG cars up to the S65."
49,2007-09-11T13:06:12+00:00,lemko,"...a white 2008 Buick LaCrosse with the more substantial grille. It should address the complaint that the LaCrosse looks too much like the last-gen Taurus. However, if you put the Taurus and the LaCrosse next to each other, they really look nothing alike.

Shoot, I'd consider the LaCrosse Super for myself."

Oh and blast from the past, saw a Buick Rendezvous this morning. Haven't seen one of those in months, they've pretty much disappeared :surprise:

Yesterday, I saw a new CTS on the back of a carrier. Looks good in white. Also had an Aston Martin Vantage tailing me up to work for a while. What a stunner!"
3,2007-09-12T20:34:17+00:00,ateixeira,"I think I saw a CTS as well, wasn't quite sure (it was far) but it didn't look familiar the way an STS does, so that must have been it."

5,2007-09-13T18:33:59+00:00,stever,"I went cross town this morning (cross-county really) to get some straw and coming back on the backroads I encountered 3 sheriff's cars escorting a new 15 passenger van. Except the passengers were all in full military gear and were riding on running boards hanging off both sides and the rear of the van. Couldn't tell if there was anyone riding inside with the driver.

Looked like a load of Keystone Cops.

Probably something cooked up with Homeland Security grant funds."

Tundra pickups are becoming quite popular here, as is the newest CRV. Saw an 08 Accord sedan this morning, a couple of 335i models and as usual, a bazillion new Camrys. The SEV6 model of those look really good."
8,2007-09-14T12:28:46+00:00,gsemike,"Yesterday while walking to Penn Station, I saw one of those black and gold Hertz Mustang GTs.

Usually hard tops have better visibility!

Bummer. Seems like they dumbed it down, the hard top that is, to soft top standards, since they offer both.

The G6 has a much better view out."

It was followed by a black Pontiac GTO. Too bad the traffic was so dang heavy on the Roosevelt Blvd. last night.

13,2007-09-17T18:14:20+00:00,ateixeira,"Vantage coupe, gorgeous!

This weekend, let's see, saw a couple of the newer Escape/Tribute models. I still say they didn't change enough.

Saw just my 2nd new Highlander on the roads, too."

16,2007-09-17T18:44:11+00:00,qbrozen,"I was behind a new Vue on the way to work this morning. I gotta say, its pretty unattractive from behind. I think it is the ""overdoneness"" of it. The reflectors recessed into the bumper, the plastic silver tailpipe surround, and the fat chrome strip across the tailgate all look like afterthoughts. Remove all of that and I think it would be so much better."

Behind it are an Audi Q7, also new, and a 911 slant-nose conversion kit."
18,2007-09-17T18:53:56+00:00,qbrozen,"oh, a conversion kit. I guess that would explain why I couldn't figure it out. Makes it look a bit like a TR7 in the front in that pic. Don't know why you'd do that to a porsche. And the wheels are pretty darned hideous, too."
19,2007-09-17T18:59:22+00:00,kyfdx,"Very popular conversion in the '80s, which is what that one looks like... Usually done on turbos..."

I saw the an '08 Accord on the road. Coming at me the front grille is very similar to the Pilot."
22,2007-09-18T14:37:55+00:00,lemko,...white Lincoln MKX and a black Lincoln Aviator. Uh...do they still make the Aviator?
23,2007-09-18T14:55:27+00:00,ateixeira,"Yes, but they call it the MKX."

25,2007-09-21T19:53:01+00:00,alltorque,"Sat outside having a coffee and watching the world go by on Saturday in Dalkey, just south of Dublin. In the space of 30 mins spotted 2 x Bentley Conti GTC's, (Silver and Graphite), a Conti GT, (Silver) and a Ferrari F430 in dark blue. Staggering. BMW 6's, (hard and soft-tops), almost commonplace. There's a lot of money swashing around Dublin at present but the driving standards are attrocious. On Tuesday saw my first Lexus President LS460 near Dublin airport - Black and black windows, very intimidating. My wife said that if they fitted a big gun on the roof it would make a fine main battle tank................she's not really a car person, bless her.

Came back to UK for a touch of reality."

A co-worker's mother took delivery of an 08 V6 Accord yesterday, she drove by to show him and I had a look. Pretty nice, and big indeed."
28,2007-09-23T23:36:34+00:00,fintail,"Today I rode in a Volvo C30 and a new MB C300 - a friend is thinking about either, and test drove them. Both pretty refined cars. The new C-class really is a step up from the W203, seemed nicely finished even at the 34K relatively stripped model I experienced. The C30 was also pretty basic, lots of empty spots on the dash and console, and it didn't even have cruise (neither of us could find it anyway). It did have pretty nice seats (manual, seems odd these days). 26K sticker."
29,2007-09-24T11:00:30+00:00,guss,I was behind a new Highlander yesterday. From every angle It had Camry in it. It's like they got the same guy(or committee) who designed the Camry to make a tall wagon version.
30,2007-09-24T11:33:32+00:00,andys120,"I saw a new Ferrari F430 Spider while stuck in traffic yesterday-- top-down, perfect convertible day. :shades:"
31,2007-09-24T12:41:55+00:00,lemko,...yellow Lotus Elise and a white Audi R8.
32,2007-09-24T16:06:13+00:00,qbrozen,"yup. cruise control is a $185 option on the C30. They are hoping to appeal to a younger audience by making pretty much everything an option. I don't mind the idea, but a custom ordered volvo can take quite a long time to arrive, PLUS they are charging I believe a $300 ""customization fee"" right from the getgo. So if you JUST want cruise control, that $185 option becomes $485. yikes!"
33,2007-09-24T16:15:46+00:00,british_rover,"Land Rover did the same thing with the LR3 when it first came out. With the exception of the 4wd systems and safety systems nearly everything was optional. As the 2005 production moved along more and more things became standard or in some cases were dropped. Within a year they had paired the options list down to just three or four packages and made everything else standard.

They used the marketplace to figure out which options people wanted most often and made those standard. Things that were often ordered with other options became standard and thing that no one ordered were dropped completely or made dealer installed accessories."
34,2007-09-24T17:02:36+00:00,fintail,"It's pretty crazy, as the base car is not exactly cheap. In comparing the MB to the Volvo...to equip the Volvo like the MB, it would end up costing only a few grand less. The Volvo seemed like a neat little car and was remarkably smooth...but for me, a new Mercedes for not much more is very appealing."
35,2007-09-24T17:07:45+00:00,qbrozen,"true. But where the volvo appeals is that you don't HAVE to get all that stuff, ya know? So you COULD get a $23k volvo, if you were so inclined.

Not to mention the hatchback versatility."
36,2007-09-24T17:22:23+00:00,british_rover,I don't see people cross shopping a C-class vs a C30 either. Those are about as diametrically opposed as two passenger cars can be.
37,2007-09-24T17:27:40+00:00,fintail,"That's probably part of it, along with the cars not truly being in the same target market as british_rover said as well. Maybe the comparison was greater for me because my local MB and Volvo dealers are next door to each other."

Nice.. about the same size as my CR-V... :surprise:"

Are you sure you saw an Enclave? The Enclave is a full 2 feet longer than a CRV, 8 inches wider, and 6 inches taller.

It *is* basically a Camry wagon, though."
43,2007-09-25T05:32:51+00:00,mb789,"I spotted a 2008 Jeep Liberty. First one I've seen on the road. Looked burgundy color. Sharp looking, but could be mistaken for a Commander at first. I've seen several others at dealerships, though."
44,2007-09-25T16:41:32+00:00,guss,"It looks like Jeep is trying to make all of their cars look like the old Cherokee, Commander all the way down to the Patriot."
45,2007-09-25T19:15:44+00:00,ateixeira,"Nothing wrong with a family resemblance. I tend to think the Compass looks a bit out of place, though."
46,2007-09-25T21:00:58+00:00,andys120,"I spotted a Bentley Azure cruising the Hutchinson River Parkway in Westchester, naturally it was blue but a dark blue not what you'd call ""azure blue""."
47,2007-09-25T21:04:20+00:00,andys120,"IMHO Jeep should fire the entire styling/design department, except for the new Wrangler and the GC they look pretty awful. I cringe every time I see a Compass, Patriot or Commando, they use some of the design cues of the Cherokee but lack the simple attractiveness of the original Cherokee."
48,2007-09-26T14:41:16+00:00,derrado1,"Saw my first Patriot today, as well as my first Commander. Goes to show how unsuccessful Compass/Commander are around my neck of the woods... still haven't seen a Compass on the roads, only just seen a Commander, and the Patriot's fresh off the boat and I'm already seeing 'em. To add insult to injury, Compass is the same price as the Patriot.

When I first saw the Compass in pictures, I thought it was ugly. Then it kind of grew on me. But seeing one at the Jeep dealer the other week made me realise its ugliness."
49,2007-09-26T15:15:10+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw two of these this AM.

I have to wonder if they are selling well, because I haven't seen a lot of these, and there is a Caddy dealer in my zip code."
0,2007-09-27T02:42:40+00:00,gsemike,"Have seen a couple the last couple of days. Form the rear it looks like a Mazda. Overall, I prefer the GMC and Saturn. The whole front of the Enclave is just a bit overdone."
1,2007-09-27T12:56:49+00:00,lemko,"Somebody at work bought a new Enclave. I see it every day in the same spot.

Seems there must be a fire sale on Chrysler Sebrings as I've been seeing a lot of them lately. Sorry, no little ""e"" sticker."
2,2007-09-27T16:50:27+00:00,anythngbutgm,I've noticed lately a lot of the new Tundras are equipped with BACK RACK'S on them for contractor duty. That is certainly a good sign that these things are not just driveway queens.
3,2007-09-27T17:37:35+00:00,ateixeira,"You reminded me, I'm seeing several Ridgelines every day. The house across the street is being completely renovated inside and out.

I'm surprised because these are contractors' cars, they even have the logos on the side. Not one, but probably 4-5 different Ridgelines. Different logos, too.

I'm surprised to see them, frankly, the Tundra would make more sense to me.

Also saw a very filthy CX9 at lunch. The car has surely never been washed."
4,2007-09-27T17:48:48+00:00,anythngbutgm,"They pretty much blend in with the rest of the trucks out there. Honestly, the only trucks I notice besides the RL is the new Tundra and the RAM. The best looking two IMO. Saw a Candy Apple red CrewMax this morning which looked fantastic."

6,2007-10-01T07:26:35+00:00,peetiedog,"I spotted a new 2008 Audi S5 today running around the San Francisco/Oakland East Bay Area. It was wearing Arizona manufacturer's plates. I had some time on my hands, so I shadowed it for about 20 minutes. That is truly on beautiful car. I've been reading a lot of the articles on this car lately in all of the buff mags. It is actually as beautiful in person as it appears in the magazines. Very sexy lines. I think Audi has another really big hit on their hands. This car along with some of their other new offerings ('07 Q7, '08 TT, and '08 R8) is going to make Audi a much stronger challenger to BMW and M/Bnz.

After some checking, I found out that VW/Audi has an engineering/tech. center in Livermore, CA (deep East Bay Area, midway between Oakland and Stockton, CA. I hear that there may be a couple of these cars running around in this area. Official launch date is not until late November '07, so this is probably either a european version, or a US test mule version. I understand that the car will be appearing at the Los Angeles Int'l Auto Show in November and the San Francisco Auto Show, also in November. So spotting this car was really an exciting event for me. This may be regular happenings for the Michigan folk, or even the Arizona folks, as a lot of manufacturers have proving grounds and test facilities in those states. But we don't see this sort of thing much in our part of the world."

I also passed the Audi showroom on Park ave. where they had a grey S8 with red leather, S5, TT, S6, and a ridiculously attractive blue R8 with navy side blade and terra cotta interior. I am so in love with that car it isn't even funny."
8,2007-10-04T02:43:42+00:00,fintail,"I have seen a couple AMG CLs on the road, but I couldn't tell if they were 63 or 65. I think the AMG trim looks pretty good, big and menacing. I did see an S65 drive up my street the other day.

My area has a hugely busy Audi dealer, and although I drive by it maybe once a week - no R8 in the showroom nor have I seen one on the road. I want to see one of these.

For normal cars - I have seen a few new Vues lately, much improved over the cheap looking previous model. Also, a few 08 Accords on the road already, all sedans."

Na, just kidding. She was an attractive african-american female, probably about 30 years old. I'm terrible at guessing ages.

I didn't recognizer her, but could have been famous, or could have been a BMW employee or something, I suppose.

I was going to take a photo but she might have thought I was stalking her. Then out of the blue she asks me where New Hampshire Ave was.

At least I gave her good directions. :shades:"

There seems to be a Subaru dealer at every corner, it's like Ford dealers around here (Mid Atlantic).

In fact, when you give someone directions, it might sound like this:

39,2007-10-18T17:29:56+00:00,rockylee,"a black Rolls-Royce Phantom. I wonder what he was doing in my neighborhood?

He was probably trying to make a delivery of it to your driveway. :P

44,2007-10-29T00:38:39+00:00,rockylee,"My brother says a Porsche, but it very easily could be a Jaguar. Aston Martins and Jags, were rebadges anyways

46,2007-10-29T01:53:18+00:00,stickguy,Is that something real odd like a SPyker (sp?)
47,2007-10-29T03:38:54+00:00,fintail,That's it - Spyker C8 Laviolette...first I have seen
48,2007-10-29T03:58:09+00:00,rockylee,"Well it looks like a badge engineered Martin or Jag. :confuse:

although i'm not sure why i knew it. It is pretty ugly, IMHO. It would be far better without all that chrome. Makes me think of a poorly-made model car."
0,2007-10-29T13:18:42+00:00,british_rover,"I didn't look below the first post so it is a Spyker if no one else has guessed yet.

That company is in trouble though. They sold their F1 team and are struggling."

4,2007-10-30T17:38:58+00:00,bumpy,It looks like a Mazda CX-9 that was worked over with the business end of a chrome stick. I'm a bit surprised Buick didn't chrome the tires.

6,2007-10-30T20:05:40+00:00,british_rover,"On the back mountain road I take to work sometimes saw a 2008 quattroporte in black.

8,2007-11-01T03:41:25+00:00,andys120,"I got a good look at a new Enclave today when I took my MIL's car in for service. I reached these conclusions:

1) It's nice looking and well detailed (exterior) but White isn't the best color for it.

2) It's HUGE, towering over the SWB Denali parked next to it. Perhaps that is why....

3) It's thirsty w EPA ratings of 19C-24H and that's for the 3.6 V6 w 6/A.

4) It's ridiculously tall for a FWD vehicle, again a higher step than the Denali. The women to whom this might appeal will not be pleased. I passed up a chance to sit in it because it looked like a pain and the interior didn't look that special.

5) I was more impressed by the Lucerne in the showroom with a nice coat of gloss black, tight shutlines, nice interior and a very solid sound when doors were closed."
9,2007-11-01T03:48:14+00:00,andys120,"I thought they only did this with Buicks and Caddys, anymore..

Nah, there's no end to the aftermarket conversions that add those silly things to otherwise good looking cars. I saw a
BMW E30 (early 90s 3-series) the other day with a black carriage half-roof over white.

At least he didn't put on a Continental Spare and Whitewalls. :sick:"
10,2007-11-01T12:09:42+00:00,bumpy,"Silver, temporary tag, and a little ""e"" sticker on the back. Just another example of SUVs reverting back to the station wagons they used to be."

Sounds pretty good to me considering the size/weight/power of the vehicle. Neither our Pilot nor Pacifica were rated that high."
12,2007-11-01T14:18:18+00:00,british_rover,And thats the overly aggressive 2008 EPA ratings. I am assuming the one you were looking at was a FWD model cause I think the AWD model is more like 16/23
13,2007-11-01T16:37:20+00:00,ateixeira,The Lucerne is a slow seller and they can't build Lambdas fast enough! I think all 3 models are still below the industry-ideal 60 days' supply.
14,2007-11-01T16:59:54+00:00,stickguy,"new C 30 out in public. First owner operator unit that I recall seeing.

Starting to see a lot of new Accord 4 doors though. They are spreading."
15,2007-11-01T17:01:46+00:00,kyfdx,So.. what's your gut reaction to the C30?
16,2007-11-01T20:27:20+00:00,british_rover,Seen a couple around here but this is Volvo country.
17,2007-11-02T00:10:46+00:00,natenj1971,Saw a silver 2008 Accord EX Coupe (4 cyl). Silver with optional rear spoiler. It doesn't look as huge as the specs make it out to be. Infact the previous gen looks wider (maybe cause it's shorter). Kinda like it.
18,2007-11-02T01:45:50+00:00,stickguy,"I like it, but I also have a soft spot for the old 1800ES (see, I left out the P!)

I checked one out at the dealer recently. Qutie roomy in the back, once you get in there. I'm 6' tall, and fit fine.

Funky styling, but kooool! Should do well.

C&D did a comparo test this month between the C30, speed3, Caliber SXT (?), and the WRX. I believe they called the C30 the car for baby boomer mini buyers (or something along those lines)."
19,2007-11-02T16:10:40+00:00,british_rover,I want a C30 and I am no baby boomer but then I bought a MINI as well and the demographics for that car have been skewed towards the boomers as well.
20,2007-11-02T16:17:31+00:00,anythngbutgm,"really wants a C30. She had one of those C-class hatches that everybody hated (but for utility, it was fantastic) and is definitely looking for a nice premium hatch again (The MDX is too much vehicle for her). I have seen (2) loaded version 2.0's in the white with the brown lower trim and they look fantastic.

Haven't driven one yet for fear that she'll buy it on the spot."
21,2007-11-02T16:20:22+00:00,british_rover,"Every dealer got a White 2.0 with the brown body kit and a Blue 1.0 as demos.

You can get good deals on either one of those although I would be hesitant to buy a manual with a lot of test drive miles."
22,2007-11-02T16:34:48+00:00,anythngbutgm,"That makes sense, both dealers also had the blue 1.0 now that you mention it...

If she does buy one, it'll most likely be an automatic , but I'd like to drive both myself. I'm curious to see how it drives compared the the Cooper S that we drove a year ago (before the makeover)."
23,2007-11-02T16:39:15+00:00,british_rover,"Faster in a straight line but not as nimble with a bit more body roll in the bends.

More comfortable on the highway though without the runflat tires that they stick on all the Coopers."
24,2007-11-02T16:45:34+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Gee thanks, now you've spoiled it for me J/K

Actually, the reviews have said pretty much the same, but the Volvo is also bigger which is a big plus over the Mini (She is a business owner who makes occasional trips for supplies).I myself would probably choose the Mini from a drivers standpoint, but the wife wants a combination of utility, comfort and that hefty, solidity with a ""essence"" of a sport coupe thrown in like her old Benz and her 98' Accord V6 coupe she had previously."
25,2007-11-02T16:48:56+00:00,british_rover,OH I agree the C30 is much more practical then the MINI and I will give up a little bit of fun to drive to get the better ride and practicality. I could adjust the driver's seat and steering wheel to a point where I could drive the car comfortably and have someone my size sit behind me. That would be impossible in the MINI. I couldn't fit in the back seat of the MINI at all.
26,2007-11-02T16:51:04+00:00,kyfdx,"Clubman..

Too bad it's dorky looking.. (dorkier?)"
27,2007-11-02T16:53:58+00:00,british_rover,Thats the other car I am looking at but I can steal the Volvo as we have Volvo dealers in my autogroup and I can't do that with a MINI.
28,2007-11-02T17:16:42+00:00,guss,"I saw my first Smart, and it had a brand new registration sticker so it was not a demo. I was more amazed by how wide it is than it's length. I think I could fit 2 of them side by side in one bay of my garage."

30,2007-11-05T01:56:15+00:00,fintail,"Oh yeah, I also saw TWO Saaburus today. Seeing as about 15 of these were ever sold, that has to be something. A new style S80 as well, maybe 7 or 8 of those have sold (I saw an ad for $399 lease on a V8 model, so they can't be moving fast)"
31,2007-11-05T11:56:17+00:00,qbrozen,"i actually was noting yesterday how i've seen quite a few of those new s80s in my neck o the woods. I think I've seen more of those than I ever did of the previous style. It got me thinking ""hmmm... wonder if I could get a good deal on a used one when my lease is up."""
32,2007-11-05T14:00:30+00:00,lemko,...new white Ford Taurus at the Franklin Mills Mall yesterday. The Fusion-esque grille really looks sharp on the car - better than the mesh grille of the Five Hundred.
33,2007-11-05T15:39:21+00:00,anythngbutgm,"But over the weekend I saw an old, probably early 90's Toyota Land Cruiser that apparently was powered by vegetable oil. Couple of bumper stickers stated it, the smell of french fries confirmed it.

As far as new goes, the new Highlander has found quite a few takers, the Tundra is a pretty common sight (quite a few with those contractors racks on them). Couple of new S80's a C30 V1.0, few new MDX's a bunch of new Accord sedans and a pair of new Nissan Rogues.

A friend of mine came over so we went and checked out the Mazda CX-9 for his wife (She is replacing her troublesome, not so fuel efficient :blush: Suburban). Nice, very nice... We were going to go check out the Saturn Outlook since sales of those seem to be less than steller = possible rebates? but the dealership was levelled and expanded by the Honda store next door. Maybe next week..."
34,2007-11-05T18:03:16+00:00,british_rover,"When Volvo first came out with the new S80 they pulled a typical Ford and didn't offer a subvened lease. The V8 S80s were leasing for between 900 and a 1,000 dollars a month which is what a 50,000 dollar plus car should lease for with no subvention. The problem is people buying those kind of cars are used to leasing a 60,000 dollar BMW or Merc for under 900 bucks a month. Volvo gave sticker shock to the very same people they were trying to win over as conquests. Now in order to move the product they have to provide even more ridiculous leases then BMW/Mercedes do. If they had just come out with a competitive lease in the first place
they would have been fine.

Oh I also saw a V1.0 C30 on the road yesterday on the way back from our off-road driving school."
35,2007-11-05T20:28:26+00:00,ateixeira,"Accord Coupe, first time in person. Looks pretty good for a mainstream coupe.

Also saw a new Dodge Grand Caravan. Boy those things are boxy, though I'm sure that's for practical reasons.

A Ferrari tops them all off, though. What's the model that flips the lid 180 degrees to open it up like a Targa?

The exhaust note was AWESOME. He was moving slowly, then downshifted, it really asserts itself even at parking lot speeds!"
36,2007-11-05T20:40:21+00:00,anythngbutgm,"180 degree flip? Isn't that the Challenge Stradale? Great sighting!

I'm not up to speed on the Ferrari models. I think it may have been the 599 Fiorano"
37,2007-11-05T20:41:07+00:00,ateixeira,"Sounds about right.

I gotta say, in photos I thought ""no big deal"".

In person, especially with the exhaust note, my heart was pumping! :surprise:"
38,2007-11-05T20:50:39+00:00,fintail,"I can believe this - this is only the second new style S80 I have actually seen on the road. I see lots of the old ones.

I got an email from my local MB dealer (I swear I never gave them my address) advertising an 08 E350 for $549/month, with 4K down. This is how so many E-class 'sell', and why the market is glutted with 3-5 year old cars. I suppose that $399 S80 might not be a bad deal."
39,2007-11-05T20:53:38+00:00,qbrozen,"My manager just leased herself a new C300. She took me for a quick spin in it. Its a nice car. Definitely bigger inside than I would have thought. I liked some of the little thoughtful features. The old-school radio frequency dial in LCD form made me say ""cool"" for some reason. The panoramic moonroof is nice, too. And I was pleasantly surprised at the feeling of oomph from the base engine. and her's has AWD to boot."
40,2007-11-05T21:03:52+00:00,british_rover,That would be a Superamerica which is a crazy rare Ferrari.
41,2007-11-05T21:05:14+00:00,ateixeira,"That's it. It was black. The top was open.

Spotted at the Rio in Gaithersburg, MD, basically an upper middle class suburban area."
42,2007-11-05T22:01:27+00:00,andys120,"That would be a Superamerica which is a crazy rare Ferrari

I think you're right about the guy seeing a Superamerica but they aren't not even close to ""crazy rare"", 599 of the 575M Superamericas were made. You might be thinking of earlier Superamericas like the 1956 410 Superamerica of which 35 were made.

Sorry to be so pedantic but it's important to understand that before the Fiat takeover in 1969 Ferrari production numbers were very low. I grew up in NYC suburbs and during the 60s any Ferrari was something I'd see around twice a year (except for the 330GTC that belonged to a machine shop owner in my hometown).

Even that's not really rare for a Ferrari, I'd reserve ""crazy rare"" for cars made in single digit quantities like this 375 America Spider of which six were made."
43,2007-11-05T22:12:36+00:00,british_rover,I was thinking crazy rare for a modern Ferrari but I thought the production numbers were much lower then 599. I thought total production was around a 100 for the whole world. Maybe I saw the number imported to the US and thought that was the total made for the whole world.
44,2007-11-06T02:00:35+00:00,andys120,Here's the Ferrari 342 America I meant to post in #3969 (6 made)>
45,2007-11-06T02:05:26+00:00,andys120,I couldn't find production figures for the 599GTB but I'm sure when it's all said and done the numbers will be two or three times those of the 575M Superamerica.

Well... if GM weren't calling the shots.."
48,2007-11-07T19:32:15+00:00,kyfdx,"If you've seen the new G35 sedan, you've noticed the chrome strip along the rear of the trunk lid... where a lip spoiler might be..

Today, while sitting behind one at a stop light, I noticed a little black square (about 1""), right in the middle of it.

Rear-view camera, working off the NAV?"
49,2007-11-08T12:48:39+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Yes, I believe the new G is available with Backup Camera. Why anyone would need that in a sedan :blush: , I have no clue."
0,2007-11-08T14:38:44+00:00,bumpy,"Because half of the sedans on the market today have perfectly awful rear visibility, a result of tall trunks and long swoopy rooflines."
1,2007-11-08T15:30:31+00:00,kyfdx,"I think maybe they offer it, because once you have the NAV, it is pretty cheap..... and, luxury import drivers really like the gee whiz factor..

Either it was a play on ""G"", or he just pees a lot.. :surprise:"
2,2007-11-08T21:09:30+00:00,teds1,Nope its the Superamerica. it's a 550/575 variant with a unique variable opacity electronic roof. The challenge stradale is a lightweight hardcore 360
3,2007-11-14T15:54:35+00:00,natenj1971,Saw a new Malibu this morning - was a fancy model in black. No license plate in the front (just where are they going to fit the front plate?). Had a very upscale volvo look in person.
4,2007-11-14T16:31:19+00:00,andys120,"I saw a new '08 CTS, the same shade of metallic red as featured in Caddy's ads. It confirmed what I'd seen in photos, the grille is just too damn big, otherwise it's nice looking."
5,2007-11-14T16:50:30+00:00,british_rover,I think the enormous grill is the next styling fad I just won't like to go along with the mail slot armored car windows and bangle butt.

7,2007-11-15T12:48:50+00:00,anythngbutgm,"The coupe is the flashy one, I'd say probably the best looking one since the 98' - 02' at least, maybe even all time... The sedan is meant as a Camry alternative so low flash is more prominent in that class and the Accord fits in nicely IMO.

Those looking for a slicker sedan should be looking for the new Mazda6 or even the Altima 3.5SE (Or Legacy GT). But the Accord holds its own."

Also saw a new Audi TT. Looks good but doesn't draw attention the way the original did when it came out."
10,2007-11-15T16:00:25+00:00,bumpy,A Jaguar with a Type R badge? Jeebus. :confuse:
11,2007-11-15T16:03:39+00:00,british_rover,"R is Jaguars high performance line. It is not a Type-R like Acura uses.

The R Jags are The S-Type R, XJR and XKR. The XFR will be out next year sometime with a rumored 500 hp direct injection supercharged 5.0 liter version of the current 4.2 liter AJ-V8. The XKRR will most likely follow that car with an even hotter version of that engine and possibly a real manual transmission."
12,2007-11-15T16:08:42+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, it's funny, they put S-Type on the left, and then a lone ""R"" on the right."

Either the guy was lost, visiting his poorer relations, or even more of an extreme car nut than myself."

She commented on how long it was, and I agree. You can see how it grew to a full-sizer.

And at 80 grand a pop for one of those suckers, not even half that for the others I'd say we New Englanders are voting with our wallets and here LR's are quite successful.

I really hope that Ford manages to hold on to this one, I think they have something they can work with.

Also saw a bunch of new Accord sedans, a few of those new Tribecas and Highlander sales have really taken off here. On the high end side of things, a bunch of new C-classes, some CLS's, SL's and SLK's, a pair of Bentley GT's (cruising together, one after the other) a couple of 335i's and new X5's and a bunch of Q7's. :shades:"

The problem is jaguar is in such bad shape that Ford is convinced they need dump it and they have to throw in LR to make the sale go through. I am almost looking forward to the sale. I won't miss having to run stuff through the morons at FoMoCredit and maybe Land Rover will start offering some decent lease packages so we don't constantly lose deals to other brands.

It was sitting in a parking lot so no idea what it sounded like. This tips were at least six inches past the end of the bumper and looked really bad.

Saturn Sky? Six of them sitting at the local Saturn dealer.. Looks like they are very, very cold.... Are chrome wheels standard? They could really use silver alloys, instead.."

LR is very much a regional thing. Once you get outside the Northeast Corridor and a few other high-dollar enclaves, new ones are a rare find. I saw more LR's when I went to Maryland last Saturday than I see in a whole year."
27,2007-11-26T16:27:11+00:00,ateixeira,"I test drove a Vue Redline and saw a few Skys. Chrome wheels, too.

Top fitment is so poor, plus you have to get out of the car to raise or lower that top.

I think they look great, but they miss on some very key issues IMHO, so I'll probably replace my Miata with...another Miata."
28,2007-11-26T17:01:59+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I was interested in the Sky before I bought my S2000. I was interested in it mainly for its looks and the 20k (bargain) asking price to start. That hype ended once I saw the actual production model in person, what a disaster.

The thing is just a mess, from the ill-fitting, manual top to the bathtub seating position, terrible visibilty, cheap materials and sitting on the crossmembers for seat padding. Then once the plauging differential problems showed up I was thankful that I didn't spend even 20 grand on one.

At least I wouldn't have bought one with an Automatic which is also troublesome but even then the manual gearbox was clunky, notchy and imprecise... kind like a truck from which it came from.

Lutz wanted a car that was attractive, youthful and hit a bargain basement pricepoint and I think he succeeded. Too bad the finished product is also basement quality. :sick:

A Miata is on a totally different level quality-wise, and is just so much better thought out. :shades:"
29,2007-11-26T17:04:38+00:00,ateixeira,"I sat in a Sky in the showroom and build quality seemed good, so maybe they've improved that a bit. My complaint was the top fitment and a stiff clutch pedal.

To be fair I'm used to a '93 Miata, with a very soft clutch.

But...I have an aftermarket top that I put on myself and I swear the fit is 10 times better than the factory top on a brand new Sky. For shame..."

Oh, and one of the guys in my S2k club bought a base model Solstice (2 grand less than the Saturn) for his wife back when they first came out. In that cool British racing green color with the biege interior.

Well with her car, both the tranny and the rear diff. have been replaced on it already. The top has two holes where the convertible frame rails have worn through / pinched, one of the window motors siezed and the speakers crackle badly with anything remotely resembling a bass note. Car only has something like 22,000 miles on it :confuse: but you'd swear the thing has 10 times that.

I don't know if the Saturn would be better in any of those areas but based on his car, no way would I put up with that crap :sick: even for the bargain basement asking price."

It's still pretty small compared to anything else but noticeably larger.

It was a white over blue Cooper S with very nice optional wheels."

Also, they're not new any more, so you probably don't notice them as much.

The 08 model looks better and has set 3 records in a row in terms of monthly sales. It's still a low volume car, though."

So we went out with them last night for dinner, they drove and I got my first ride in one of these ridiculous behemoths. The thing was loaded, Black and did I mention big? It was OK I guess, the engine was smooth (I find GM V8's to be really smooth in general), the interior was somewhat quiet and the thing took our New England bumps and ruts with ease. But with 1400 miles on the odometer, the rear passenger was missing and the speakers crackled and popped with even the slightest amount of bass. Oh and the transmission had this weird whirring noise on the highway and the rear backup lights never turned off (they stayed on while the truck was in park).

This is a rental but still, 1400 miles?

At dinner in Boston, I spotted new Sequoia and bazillion new Highlanders (something about riding around in a truck just makes you notice other large vehicles for some reason ) I did see a new Volvo C30 hatchback outside the restaurant though..."

There are only 300 available this year and I got to sit in one and shift through the gears (on a rotating pedestal, not the street but still pretty cool) It struck me as just as comfortable and useable as the sedans and that is a pretty neat trick for a mid engined low slung sports car. So gorgeous. The S8 and Rs4 had these afwul agressive red interiors, maybe they look good in a showroom but can you imagine driving around in a $100k v10 bordello?"

Fillups cost 105 bucks, twice in 500 or so miles. We managed to burn through a half a tank going into and out of Boston the other night so I'm not surprised.

Seems like it could be distracting to oncoming traffic. If you've got one of these parked in a driveway, rear facing towards the street, people driving by are going to think you are backing out of the driveway and slow down or come to a stop which could cause an accident. Kind of stupid using the back up lights if you ask me.

And regarding the handle, take that one up with the mods if you have a problem with it. I've been here for years with it. Of course if I changed it to NothingbutGM or GMrules or GMisgod there would be no problems huh?"

Why is it dumb to have bright lights behind a vehicle stay on after it is turned off when people are exiting the vehicle?

I think a big difference between domestic-brand ""fanboys"" and Japanese-brand ""fanboys"", is that the domestic guys know and can admit that there have been quality issues with the domestics in the past (as well as sometimes in the present) and have been ""beat up"" for liking domestic cars because of perceptions formed sometimes ten years or more ago by the Japanese-brand fanboys. So be it. We can accept that. The domestics did cause a lot of their own headaches back then, and continue to do so in some ways today. But when the Japanese brands start having serious issues (do you think that Suburban's tailgate will separate in two like Tundras are??), with the Japanese-brand fanboys, what I like to call ""Baghdad Bob"" syndrome takes over....""There are no American bombs going off near here!"", when you could hear them in the background! There is an abject inability to admit that the problems are serious, and embarrassing to the manufacturer.

I discovered about twenty years ago, that those who consider themselves liberal-minded and enlightened, are actually some of the most narrow-minded folks out there. Point-by-point discussions are met with rolled eyes and name-calling.

5,2008-01-07T14:06:33+00:00,lemko,...a silver Mercedes R-Class. Do they still make it?
6,2008-01-07T14:53:38+00:00,ateixeira,"I think so, but it's a slow seller.

They priced it above the ML. Most other makes price their vans below their SUVs, so that was a mistake.

Saw a Maserati Quattoporte today, beautiful car."
7,2008-01-07T19:01:43+00:00,fintail,"There are now 2 new style WRX living at my apartment building. I am also seeing the new design a bit on the road, every other day at least. I am surprised, given the blandness of the design."
8,2008-01-08T19:40:38+00:00,teds1,"Yeah I saw two new imprezas (non wrx) in hatchback form and I was truly surprised that anyone had bought one. Where the hell is the value proposition here? It's ugly, not faster, small, and pricey. Yuck get a mazda 3 or something."
9,2008-01-08T21:21:02+00:00,ateixeira,"They're great if you live in the snow belt and want AWD.

170hp for $17k or so, well equipped, with AWD. SX4 is the only cheaper alternative with AWD I can think of, and it's not as nice.

Impreza looks like a Mazda3 so I'm surprised you'd say yuck to an Impreza look-alike.

Saw 3 new Highlanders today. They're on sale, apparently."
10,2008-01-08T22:07:46+00:00,fintail,"The hatch looks like a 3 anyway, that sedan is really Korean looking, and I don't mean pleasant derivative styling.

Today I've seen about 10 current S-class and a Bentley Flying Spur...maybe the economy hasn't completely collapsed here yet."
11,2008-01-09T13:15:59+00:00,lemko,...a new dark blue Malibu and a medium blue Suzuki Reno.
12,2008-01-09T15:04:18+00:00,ateixeira,I see a lot more hatches. I think I've only seen one sedan so far on the roads.
13,2008-01-09T18:21:57+00:00,magnette,"Saw one of the new ones this afternoon, the first time I've seen one in the street, although I saw one last September in Frankfurt - at the show...
Don't like the rear lights though...."
14,2008-01-09T19:28:39+00:00,kyfdx,"Maseratis look good, until you see the Aston Martins... :surprise:

A poor man's AM?"
15,2008-01-09T20:02:02+00:00,guss,"Out of all of the Italians, Maserati is the one I don't love. Somehow their styling is just a bit odd to me."
16,2008-01-10T16:14:56+00:00,ateixeira,Saw 2 more this morning. They seem to be selling very quickly.
17,2008-01-11T18:35:34+00:00,teds1,"Oh I am well aware of the traditional appeal of the Impreza, I love them and the WRX (04-05 model) is probably my next car... but I couldn't hate the new shape more. I hate everything about it. The Mazda on the other hand is great looking, I don't think you can compare the two at all besides their basic configuration. I certainly appreciate the appeal of the inexpensive awd option but I just don't understand how anyone can bear to drive one of those things.

Also saw a Maybach 62 S two days ago... Now that is a rare car"
18,2008-01-24T14:01:57+00:00,lemko,...silver 2008 Cadillac CTS across the intersection of Cottman and Oxford in NE Philly while stopped at a red light on my way to work.
19,2008-01-24T16:08:12+00:00,ateixeira,"First one I've seen, still had temporary tags. The new generation, too.

I guess they're arriving.

That car stands out like you wouldn't believe. People were gawking."
20,2008-01-24T16:21:54+00:00,guss,"People were gawking

That's why people are buying."
21,2008-01-24T16:36:51+00:00,bumpy,Deliveries started within the last week or so. Did you see if it was from Tysons or Alexandria?
22,2008-01-24T16:44:03+00:00,ateixeira,"Didn't notice, sorry."
23,2008-01-24T20:37:34+00:00,magnette,Yesterday I saw two Maybachs in central London - a 57 and a 62 within a couple of minutes of each other..
24,2008-01-25T18:33:00+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw one of these downtown late yesterday. Looked pretty spiffy so it must have been a Limited model.

They're nice enough, but over $40 grand to use a little less gas? Isn't that a bit of an oxymoron, i.e. an expensive way to save?"
25,2008-01-26T23:44:00+00:00,magnette,"Saw one yesterday going past my office - not new, but about 2 years old. Still a rare car - I've only seen about 5 on the road."
26,2008-01-28T17:41:08+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw the GT-R in the flesh. Looks great, better than any photo I've seen could capture. Love it!

Saw lots of other new cars, too, but I think that was the stand out.

The GT500KR was close."
27,2008-02-01T13:36:35+00:00,lemko,"...reddish-brown metallic Scion xB. At least I think it's a new one because it had different headlights and grille from other xBs I've seen in the past and they didn't look aftermarket. What I found curious was the single backup lamp in the lower left hand side of the bumper.

I thought Scion was getting rid of the xB and replacing it with an xD or something?"
28,2008-02-01T13:46:17+00:00,andys120,"It's confusing but the xB is being replaced by a new xB, probably the one you saw.

2008 Scion xB>


The xD replaces the smaller xA:

2008 Scionn xD>


Got it? :confuse:"
29,2008-02-01T14:42:34+00:00,guss,"To me the xB & xD have morphed into very similar vehichles. The first time I saw each I was not sure whuch one I was looking at.

A real mistake by Scion."
30,2008-02-01T16:55:53+00:00,stever,"Got your message and removed the oversized photo, but my reply bounced to your CarSpace email. Probably some setting in your profile there that says you only accept email from other CarSpace email addresses.

You may have to settle for a link to the photo ...."
31,2008-02-01T20:18:05+00:00,ateixeira,"The funny thing is the powertrains are now actually different.

Before both shared a 1.5l, now the xD uses a 1.7l and the xB uses a 2.4l.

So they look more alike, yet they're actually less alike. If that makes sense."
32,2008-02-11T13:52:55+00:00,lemko,...new 2008 Honda Accord in medium gold color a block away from my house in NE Philly.
33,2008-02-12T00:38:50+00:00,fintail,"I'm seeing several new Malibus on the road now...must be a good sign out here in Camcord land (although at least one did have a barcode). New Accord sedans are now a common sight too, and I have even seen a few coupes.

Yesterday I saw what I think was a CL63...it has a nice imposing look and screams money."
34,2008-02-13T01:38:29+00:00,andys120,"I think it's maybe the third R-Class Mercedes I've ever seen. What a bomb!

I also saw the first new Malibu I've seen outside of a car show, a grey four-door."
35,2008-02-13T12:07:15+00:00,guss,"How long has the R-class been out, maybe 3 or 4 years ? I have seen maybe a dozen. I think everyone thought it was a Pacifica rebadge.

I saw a new Subaru WRX.....boring."
36,2008-02-13T16:06:01+00:00,qbrozen,"they've been pretty popular here in jersey. Guess they should have just sold it here.

I would say I see them about as often Scion xBs (both old and new) and Porsche Cayennes (to give to sides of the spectrum), and both of those are considered raging successes, no? The jersey market definitely seems to be an anomaly."
37,2008-02-13T20:28:43+00:00,fintail,"Kind of like here. I have seen many R-class, even some with the fake AMG sport package. Cayennes are also pretty common here."
38,2008-02-13T21:03:09+00:00,kyfdx,"I thought the R63 was a real AMG?

I know two people with R-class.. They had super cheap lease deals last year..."
39,2008-02-13T21:58:54+00:00,fintail,"Well, it's as AMG as a minivan can get :P

I saw some low leases on those too, $349 or $399 I think. Still, not for me."
40,2008-02-13T23:17:30+00:00,andys120,"It seems to be my week for oddball Benzes. Today I saw a white B200 with British Columbia tags. Nice looking rig, even if it looked a trifle Japanese-generic. It wasn't that small, about CR-V sized, but it rode lower.

In the same lot I saw a Bright Yellow Corvette Z06, at first I didn't realize it wasn't a regular ' Vette but then I realized it was a little lower, wore BIG wheels and spotted the hood, scoop/slot that distinguishes the Z06 from ordinary Corvettes.

I think I'm starting to like the C6."
41,2008-02-14T02:25:08+00:00,stickguy,"at the car show Sunday!

I also was behind an R class tonight, and saw one the other day. Might have been the same one, since it seems they are all silver.

The other day I saw a ton of Accords all at the same time. It was like a convention. They must be selling well.

At the show, the MB C class was a major downer. looks OK, but the interior was lousy. Seemed very cheap, especially in tan.

THe Malibu, however, had a super nice interior, comfy seats, etc. Light years ahead of the old one.

I also like the Rogue. If I needed a small ute thingee, that would get a serious look.

My favorite though was the new Volvo V70. Man, I want to get the wife into one of those instead of the Minivan! $$ and carrying capacity be damned!

Oh, and the Jag F type looked really slick. Should do well."
42,2008-02-14T15:40:20+00:00,qbrozen,"I love the look of the new V70, but man is that thing big and overweight! Did we get the new V70 in the dealerships yet? Seems it was quite a ways behind the XC70."
43,2008-02-15T14:05:03+00:00,lemko,"...this morning: red Nissan Altima, champagne-colored Hyundai Accent, and a dark gray Saturn Sky Turbo."
44,2008-02-15T14:42:20+00:00,PF_Flyer,"A very interesting bit of electric vehicle news came up on the Alternate Route this morning... could lead to a whole bunch of new places to spot new cars :P

Bond, James Bond"
45,2008-02-15T18:38:21+00:00,ateixeira,"Looks too much like the Edge, in fact that's what I thought it was at first."
46,2008-03-03T01:26:42+00:00,fintail,"I finally saw a R8 today...yeah, I like it. Seems like a supercar bargain too.

Also, a Cayenne GTS (I think these are new), about 10 late model Astons...maybe there was some kind of club event, although I saw them at different times, a few new C-class, and a new CTS...sitting at the Enterprise lot. Maybe they are using these to replace their fleet of old C-class."
47,2008-03-03T16:02:05+00:00,teds1,"I had a meeting this weekend with a guy at his house in Long Island. It was a nice house but not super fancy on a quiet street. However, when I pulled into the driveway his son was just leaving... in his new silver Gallardo!!!! The guy (couldn't be over 35) had just leased it and broght it out to let his dad drive. It was soooo cool sounding. Unbelievably I saw a black one parked by my house when I got home."
48,2008-03-03T16:14:29+00:00,guss,"Unbelievably I saw a black one parked by my house when I got home.

I thought the rest of the story was going to be that your wife bought you one.

A Gallardo would be the car I would buy if I hit the Lotto.

I woder how much it is to lease one......hmmm?"
49,2008-03-03T17:03:57+00:00,ateixeira,Drove by me today. Looks even better out on the roads. Thumbs up.
0,2008-03-04T16:58:01+00:00,ateixeira,"Looks OK, window line seems very high so visibility must be reduced. All the lights seem to bulge outward like blisters. Not sure I like that particular styling cue.

Looked good overall, though.

Corollas sure are getting big. This is no longer the compact it used to be."
1,2008-03-04T16:59:13+00:00,kyfdx,"The new one... in bright white..

Looks great.. wish they made it in a 4-door.."
2,2008-03-05T20:59:06+00:00,magnette,"Saw one of these in Baker Street this morning - not that unusual, really, but this one had a bit of a custom job - a red stripe and a dent on the rear nearside wing - couldn't decide whether it had hit a bus or a post-office van, but somebody was going to get a nice bill I would imagine"
3,2008-03-06T03:02:46+00:00,guss,"On my commute home tonight. At first I thought it was a Pacifica, but the dodge grill was throwing me. I don't think they share any parts, but they are still very similar."
4,2008-03-06T16:11:26+00:00,ateixeira,"The local dealer has 2 of them - one is $26 grand and the other is $31 grand. This is after discounts.

Are they nuts? Seriously, this is basically an Avenger wagon, stretched.

What are they smoking that they think this is a $31k vehicle? :confuse:

This was supposed to replace the SWB minivans, which I've seen brand new for as little as $13k."
5,2008-03-06T17:18:25+00:00,qbrozen,"Those must be optioned up pretty well. It is supposed to start at $19,8, or something like that. But that's with a 4-banger and FWD.

Automobile mag says it is the quietest sub-$30k car they've ever driven and the best fit and finish they've ever seen on a Chrysler product. Their negative comment is that it is on the Avenger platform. hehe."
6,2008-03-06T17:46:16+00:00,andys120,"New S-Class Benzes are not an unusual sight but I saw one yesterday go by slowly and I couldn't help but feel it just didn't have the dramatic ""presence"" they had a decade or so ago. The new one looks vaguely Korean.

The current E-Class is the Benz to have IMO.

OTOH a Black 750i that cruised by me yesterday was loaded with presence. It looked vaguely sinister as well maybe it's the Black paint (which shone like a diamond).

."
7,2008-03-06T18:17:54+00:00,ateixeira,"I'm not surprised that it's quiet, in fact their minivan was the quietest in a recent C&D test so Chrysler must've done a lot of work on NVH control.

Still, it's supposed to slot beneath the long-wheelbase only vans, so you'd expect the prices to be significantly lower. $31k buys a pretty nice Grand Caravan."
8,2008-03-06T20:14:50+00:00,british_rover,First one of the US Spec ones I have seen. I see some privately imported older SMARTs on occasion too.
9,2008-03-06T20:22:06+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw one while walking out of the movie theatre last week with my wife.

I've seen 2 so far on the roads."
10,2008-03-07T00:34:27+00:00,tlcruz,we got our first 08 M3 coupe here and two 08 IS-F's! the M3 was gooorgeous in blue and the IS-F's were lookin' smoking hot in obsidian! I love my job
11,2008-03-07T16:58:03+00:00,ateixeira,"In my driveway.

No, didn't buy it, just got it as a rental while my Miata's RF fender is swapped out. Lady hit me in her XC90.

It's appliance white, which is appropriate because it drives like an appliance. Spoiler is cute but the cheesy wheel covers are not."
12,2008-03-13T02:49:27+00:00,kyfdx,"Better looking than the old one... but, no thrills.."
13,2008-03-13T12:57:35+00:00,lemko,...red Acura RDX.
14,2008-03-13T18:46:35+00:00,ateixeira,"First I saw in the flesh. Looks good, an evolution of the old one. I like this interior much better."
15,2008-03-13T18:59:54+00:00,lemko,"...my girlfriend recently rented a red Pontiac G6 while her LaCrosse was being repaired from the accident on January 2nd. She went to Budget this time instead of Enterprise and was treated much better and the car was much cleaner. She actually liked the G6 and considered it ""sporty and youthful."""
16,2008-03-14T15:18:57+00:00,ateixeira,"The G5 I rented was a bit dirty, mostly mud on the door sills.

I'm very, very happy to have my Miata back. Despite being 15 years old, it simply runs circles around that G5.

In fact I was ready to trade in the Miata for a newer one, but now I might keep it longer. It cleaned up pretty good after the body work they did, and still drives well (far better than the brand new G5 rental)."
17,2008-03-14T20:58:56+00:00,exit123,I saw a Smart Fortwo today. Very cute!
18,2008-03-15T14:02:01+00:00,guss,"I thought the G6 was a huge leap over the Grand Am it replaced. Unfortunately everyone from Consumer Reports to Car & Driver has totally killed it. I would give it a shot if they ever get their reliability up, and put the 4 cylinder in their higher trim levels. I guess those are some pretty big if's thought"
19,2008-03-17T16:08:05+00:00,ateixeira,"They're a lot better than the G5.

Still, I test drove one of the folding hardtops and it had a nasty creak in the A-pillar. Doesn't speak well for the structure."
20,2008-03-17T16:56:36+00:00,lemko,"...new 2008 Dodge Hemi Charger in Inferno Red. My co-worker finally bought a new Charger this past Friday after talking about it for months.

Also spotted new LaCrosse sporting the revised grille."
21,2008-03-17T17:08:56+00:00,fintail,"Yesterday I saw a Volvo C30...I'm not seeing as many of these as I thought I would.

Also an Audi S5...it had the LED running lights in the front, but only one side was on (?)"
22,2008-03-17T17:35:54+00:00,british_rover,"I am seeing a black S5 once a week or so on my commute and it is a pretty hot looking car. I think volvo only had plans to import 5,000 or so C30s this year so you won't see many of them.

Saw a new CTS the other day in black looked good."
23,2008-03-17T20:22:47+00:00,fintail,"The S5 is a beauty, this is the second one I have seen now. They've got their styling down. I also saw a RS4 yesterday...they sound so good...but I think it could get to be an old drone after awhile.

Volvo does pretty well out here...maybe delivery allotments haven't came in yet."
24,2008-03-17T20:35:22+00:00,british_rover,"I have only seen two out on the roads so far and this is Volvo country out here. Our auto group has two Volvo dealers and I still have only seen two of them.

Any given second I can look out my office window and see a dozen or more volvos and nearly as many SAABs. From what I have heard from people in Volvo they have very modest goals for the C30 and are importing very few of them initially. The S40 is supposed to be discontinued soon and the C30 will replace it so I would guess as the S40 is phased out C30 production will climb and hopefully that will drive the price of the C30 down some."
25,2008-03-17T21:38:59+00:00,kyfdx,"Couple of months ago... my dealer already had five of them... I'd bet they are all still there..

2-door hatchbacks are a tough sell.. Plus, they are mostly $30K, and not as cute as a MINI (subjective, I know)..

That Swedish flag on the roof just doesn't have the same cachet as the Union Jack.. :surprise:"
26,2008-03-17T21:54:34+00:00,british_rover,"Our two volvo dealers have 4 C30s and the average MSRP is about 26,000 dollars."
27,2008-03-18T01:36:57+00:00,fintail,"I think the one I saw yesterday might be only the second I have seen on the road too. I see more C70s than the C30, and probably 50 new C-class for every C30. I remember looking at the C30 and being with a friend who test drove one...the price did seem high for the base model we drove."
28,2008-03-18T01:51:15+00:00,british_rover,The base model price is ok but the problem is the middle and high equipment level C30s are 3-5 grand over priced.
29,2008-03-18T15:01:51+00:00,ateixeira,I'm not sure if I've seen a single one out on the road. At least not in the last month or so. They're as rare as hen's teeth.
30,2008-03-18T15:16:30+00:00,british_rover,I just saw another SMART car a few minutes ago so I have officially seen more SMARTS then C30s. There is marketing support on the C30 now too so Volvo knows they need to drop the price to get inventory moving.
31,2008-03-18T15:27:31+00:00,ateixeira,"Same here, I've seen 3 Smarts. They really stand out, though, so you just can't miss 'em."
32,2008-03-18T15:29:27+00:00,stever,"you just can't miss 'em

Let's hope the 'Slade drivers see 'em too. :shades:

Saw my first Saturn Sky Sunday. Fire engine red. Or at least it was the first parked one I've seen that I could get a good look at."
33,2008-03-18T15:35:10+00:00,ateixeira,"There's one at my kids' school. I see it in the parking lot each time I go, so it must be driven by a teacher. Come to think of it there used to be a Miata, and that's gone, so perhaps they traded up.

My concern is I have yet to see one with a good fit on the top, including that one."
34,2008-03-18T15:42:48+00:00,andys120,"Come to think of it there used to be a Miata, and that's gone, so perhaps they traded up.

Sounds more like they traded down."
35,2008-03-18T15:54:59+00:00,ateixeira,"I installed a Robbins soft top myself, even converted my NA with a zipper-windows to an NB style self-folding type, with no zipper.

I swear the fit is better than the factory fit I've seen on any Solistice or Sky."
36,2008-03-18T16:17:25+00:00,kyfdx,Every single Sky that I've seen has chrome wheels.... ugh..
37,2008-03-18T17:27:23+00:00,fintail,"I remember the one we rode in (automatic and Swedish decal, not much else) stickered at like 26K I think. It was pretty spartan - didn't even have cruise control. I know the loaded ones can easily go over 30K...heading for C-class territory.

I see several older Smarts around here, as a private importer is in the next town over. He can't be too pleased that the little things are finally official, as he was selling them for 26-28K...and the over-monied suckers around here were snapping them up."
38,2008-03-18T19:33:09+00:00,qbrozen,"coincidentally, I came to post that I saw my first C30 just yesterday, too.

When I saw it coming towards me, I thought ""oh, its an S40... but something is different. A body kit maybe ..."" then the profile came into view. I think its really a great looking car, personally. It used to be on my shopping list, but I'm convinced I don't want FWD again. Maybe with AWD and a stick, it would get back on the list. But I guess that probably won't happen if they want to keep the price down (and if it doesn't sell more). A couple of minor mods and it could push 260-270hp through all 4 wheels. That would be a fun ride, methinks."
39,2008-03-18T20:14:30+00:00,british_rover,"I agree that the C30 is a great looking car and with the 2.0 upgrades it drives very great. Really just needs a short shift kit to cure the rubbery shifter.

It is just a bit too much money though so unless I can get a huge employee discount in the fall I won't get one.

Oh and I am sure a S60R driveline would easily fit in the C30 and then you would just be a little ECU tunning away from 350 hp. Can you say STI Slayer?"
40,2008-03-18T20:25:25+00:00,fintail,A 350hp C30...now that would be something!
41,2008-03-18T21:59:44+00:00,qbrozen,"well, I'm seeing used S60Rs with 30k miles for $22k around here. I'm SOOOOO tempted. If only I wasn't SOOOOO upside-down on my lease."
42,2008-03-18T22:03:09+00:00,british_rover,Which lease the pacifica or the Honda?
43,2008-03-19T02:01:03+00:00,qbrozen,"the honda. I've got 13 payments left.
Only 6 more on the pacifica. We're pretty sure the Pac will be replaced by a used V70."
44,2008-03-19T02:36:53+00:00,stickguy,Was that a 2 year lease? I don't remember you having that one for 2 years already (as you would if it was 3 year lease).
45,2008-03-19T18:33:09+00:00,qbrozen,"3 year.
Believe it or not, its been almost 2 years. I leased it on my son's 3-month bday in May '06.
And, so far, I'm right on the money with the miles. Sitting at ~29k right now."
46,2008-03-20T14:15:14+00:00,british_rover,Yeah Honda does a pretty good job of setting up their leases just right. I have never been able to get someone out of a Honda or Acura early unless it was in the last couple of months and they were well under the miles.
47,2008-03-20T20:24:05+00:00,ateixeira,Another loose fitting top. :sick: They really seem to have wrinkles around the C-pillar area.
48,2008-03-20T22:03:41+00:00,andre1969,"on the Baltimore Washington Parkway in Maryland, I saw two odd Mopars. The first one, at first, I thought was just an '08 Caravan, but it looked a bit more hunkered down, and as I passed it, it appeared to have a longer, more SUV-ish snout to it. Not sure what it was. I remember seeing this concept car at the auto show called a Dodge Journey...it's not out yet, is it?

The other was an Intrepid, but as it passed by, I noticed that it said ""Chrysler"" on the front door where it would normally say ""Intrepid"". So I'm guessing it was a Canadian that jumped the border.

Oh, and insult of insults, in the parking lot at work I saw a Caddy STS...the new style, not the Seville STS. It had one of those awful fabric carriage tops on it! Someone needs to be tarred and feathered! Oh well, at least it didn't have wire wheels and gold stripe tires! :P"
49,2008-03-20T22:04:38+00:00,andre1969,"Another loose fitting top. They really seem to have wrinkles around the C-pillar area.

Now that you mention it, I saw a Solstice the other day, top up, and wrinkled. Must be a common flaw I guess?"
0,2008-03-21T13:50:15+00:00,ateixeira,"On every one I've seen.

I want alternatives to another Miata, yet none of the ones I've seen even pass a casual inspection.

The Journey is out, by the way. My dealer had 2 last time I was there."
1,2008-03-21T14:04:01+00:00,andre1969,"if the Journey is any good? I read an Edmund's write-up on it, and it just seemed kinda so-so. I do like the style of it though. I think it's a bit too big to stick it with a 2.4 as standard equipment, though.

As for the Miata, I don't really like the style of the new ones. Looks like a cross between a Saturn and a Good & Plenty. I thought it was pretty comfy to sit in, though. It seemed to be more comfy than the Solstice/Sky."
2,2008-03-21T14:10:28+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, I actually commented that the Ibuki concept car that inspired the Miata ""looked like a pill"". It's a bit bulbous, especially the front.

I do prefer the styling on the Solistice, by far, but...

1. You can't drop the top without getting out of the car! DUH! :mad:
2. See #1, this is a roadster for God's sake.
3. Every top I've seen is wrinkled, you wonder about the seal, cracking, fit, etc.
4. Did I mention you can't open this convertible while driving?

So, so stupid.

At least give it a power fold option or something."
3,2008-03-21T15:05:22+00:00,qbrozen,"I might take a look at a journey if my wife's car needs another service visit before lease end (which it should). The mags I've read have all said its the best fit and finish of any chrysler in history and it is the quietest sub-$30k ride they've ever experienced.

I agree about the 2.4, though. That is just ridiculous in a near 2-ton vehicle."
4,2008-03-21T15:11:10+00:00,ateixeira,"I have to see those in person. I think other recent Chrysler interiors have gone downhill, in fact it's hard to imagine cheaper interiors in some cases.

The dealer I mentioned had one for $26k and another for $31k, so they had better be nice.

I guess since it is based on the Stratus I expected much lower pricing, maybe $18-25k, tops."
5,2008-03-21T16:18:53+00:00,qbrozen,"oh yeah. we did talk about this here before, huh?

Now I can't remember the numbers exactly, but I believe a V6 AWD model starts at like $24k?"
6,2008-03-21T16:52:55+00:00,ateixeira,"Sure did.

I promise not to bring it up a 3rd time until I sample that interior in person."
7,2008-03-21T17:10:30+00:00,guss,"New Miata's have a pretty good lease deals going on right now, $199/mo for 27 months with $2100 down, I think the mileage is only 10,500 pre year though.

The definitely have more room in them than my '97, except with the top up , one of the braces lands right where my head is. The Solstice I could get used to it's size, but I prefer to wait a few years and pick one up much cheaper."
8,2008-03-21T17:20:15+00:00,guss,looks like a tall Avenger wagon. I don't know why they needed a new name for it. I have no problems with a Avenger wagon as a name but I guess the wagon body style is not as sexy as Crossover .
9,2008-03-21T17:48:51+00:00,qbrozen,my memory ain't what it used to be.
10,2008-03-23T01:41:04+00:00,qbrozen,"probably not the best place for this ... but since we were just talking about it ...

Plans were to go to the NYAIS today, but that kind of fell apart. So I went to the volvo dealer instead. This dealer is the one I bought my S70 from all those years ago. They had an '04 S60R 6-speed advertised on their site. Of course, I found out that was sold. But they were kind enough to allow me to test drive a C30 2.0 6-speed demo. It was OK. I'm not enamored with the tranny. The clutch, however, is very very light. Maybe too light. The car felt tight, light, and fairly well balanced. Power was adequate. Problem was, I didn't fit comfortably. Its just a smidge off. I could almost live with the leg room, but the big problem was how tight it was under the dash. My size 14s would get caught up under there every time I needed to shift or move to the brake.

They were then kind enough to let me drive an '04 automatic S60R they had with 69k miles on the clock. Honestly, I'm in love! And all the bad things I've read about the auto tranny in that car I feel are completely unwarranted. It is NOT slow! And WOW do I love that adjustable suspension. It feels like a Lexus in the comfort setting, a bimmer in the Sport setting, and a kit car in the Advanced setting. This thing is FUN FUN FUN! The grip is just amazing. I kept trying to induce some sort of sliding, but it just refused. That is, at least, at the speeds I was driving, which was about the max I am comfortable with on public roads. I think this is going to be the car. After driving a used 330i a month or so ago, I thought that would be the one, but, at the same time, I didn't feel like I HAD to have one. This car is different. It is calling to me.

The 2 that they had were both wrong for me, which is probably a good thing. 69k miles is too many and the other one was an '06 with 14k miles, so that was too expensive. They say they'll call if another comes around. I'd like to try the 6-speed, but I think I may be perfectly happy with the auto."
11,2008-03-23T02:04:50+00:00,fintail,"I saw one of those new Jag sedans on the road today...maybe half a mile from the Jag dealer, so I assume it was on a test drive."
12,2008-03-23T15:43:31+00:00,magnette,"Cheating a bit, because it was in the dealers window, but it's the first time I've seen a Bugatti Veyron, in Britain. It was in the showroom at Berkeley Square, the main West End dealers for Bentley. Their website says they've sold about 15, so far.
Somehow it looked smaller than I imagined,"
13,2008-03-23T22:45:53+00:00,andys120,Automatic gearboxes with their Torque Converters are sometimes better matched to Turbo drivetrain characteristics as the TC absorbs some of the snatchiness inherent when the boos comes on suddenly. At least that was the case when I drove a 9000 Turbo A/T after owning a couple of 9000T 5-speeds.
14,2008-03-24T13:56:54+00:00,british_rover,"Ahh I noticed that with one of the C30s I drove too. Was the C30 you drove Cosmic white with the chocolate colored body molding? If so it was one of the official Demo cars that Volvo gave to all the dealers and it has the LED interior lighting package.I have size 13s but wear boots almost everywhere so on the 2.0 C30 I drove my toe kept hitting one of the LED modules above the pedals. The 1.0 I drove first didn't have the LED package so there wasn't anything for me to hit my feet on.

The S60R is a very cool car and that active chassis really does work. Torque is limited somewhat in first gear but you won't really notice that unless you drive a manual S60R back to back with an auto and give both of them sustained WOT.

In the advanced setting it will actually pump up the trailing outside shock absorber to help with turn in."
15,2008-03-24T14:18:41+00:00,texases,Just saw the Top Gear where they 'raced' the Veyron against the RAF jet - great show!
16,2008-03-24T14:20:01+00:00,ateixeira,"Sounds like a future purchase to me.

I've heard great things about them. About the only criticism is their relatively high curb weight, but that could be seen as a good thing (beefy feel, crash protection, etc).

Saw an STS-4 today. Most of the ones I see are RWD."
17,2008-03-24T16:26:41+00:00,qbrozen,"ahhh... interesting info, BR ... on both counts.

The one I drove wasn't the white one I've seen pics of. I don't remember the color, but I think it was blue. Now, the one in the showroom was a 1.0 and I tried that one out, too, and I still had the toe problem. But I did feel a tad more comfy in it. I thought it may have been the manual seat, for some reason, but maybe it is what you point out."
18,2008-03-24T16:28:31+00:00,qbrozen,"I thought the same thing when I saw the curb weight (3700 lbs!). But, ya know, I guess it comes down to how it ""feels"" rather than reality. By the tale of the tape, my 350Z was a porker, too. As heavy as my S70 and my current Accord. But it certainly didn't feel that way."
19,2008-03-24T16:56:13+00:00,qbrozen,"sorry for keeping this off topic ... but I'm having trouble finding this info and you seem to know a bit about these cars, BR. What happened with the R in '06? They switched to a 6-speed auto. Does that model have full power available? If so, I might have to suck it up and wait for an '06."
20,2008-03-24T17:50:39+00:00,british_rover,"Yeah I am pretty sure the 06 and up Rs with the 6 speed auto get full power in first gear and full torque. I need to ask one of the guys down at Volvo to be sure though. The torque number for the manual equipped S60s is 295 ft-lbs at 1,800 rpms or so. I guess try and look up an old test of an automatic equipped S60R and see if they list a different spec.

EDIT:

I think I found what you were looking for.

It is impressive stuff, even if the R's 235/40R18 performance rubber does not offer the ultimate grip of an M3. There is more than enough control for the most spirited of street squids (a descriptor I never thought I would use in a Volvo road test) &#151; especially since the engine's 295 pound-feet of torque (in the new six-speed manual guise anyway; 258 with the five-speed Geartronic automatic) are transmitted through all four of the S60R's tires. More sophisticated than the XC70's system, the S60 can transfer almost 70 percent of its power to the rear wheels, reducing the understeer that plagues lesser Volvos when they are pushed around fast corners.

http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FirstDrives/articleId=80020

The 06 and 07 Rs seem to have a 295 ft-lb rating even with the automatic."
21,2008-03-24T18:11:44+00:00,qbrozen,"Thanks. Yeah, I finally found some info, too. The '06 auto is almost as fast as the manual tranny, supposedly. AND they changed the AWD a bit. Something about the '06+ Haldex being pre-loaded.

So I think this all clinches it. I gotta go for an '06. Good news is the value isn't astronomically different. I was looking at about $21-$22k for an '04 vs about $27k on an '06. Just means I may have to wait a bit longer, but I think it would be well worth it."

MRAP military vehicle... sooooo huge
Hyundai Genesis Coupe- significant car, great looking, great stats, sick value. This one will change your opinion of Korean cars - Mustang Killer
Literally Everything in the Audi Booth (except Q7) was amazing this year. The new A4/A4 avant are gorgeous as is S5
CTS-V/CTS Coupe- both great variants on an impressive car
New M3 sedan and convertible, 335
Merc CL Coupe- plutocrats dream, makes you feel like ""The Boss""
C-63- looks so fun to drive
Nissan GT-R - Drew a huuuge crowd
Mazda Furai concept - completely amazing looking car
Volvo XC60 concept - they will sell a ton of these, better looking than the XC90 by far.
Lambo Gallardo LP 560 4
Aston Vantage - They had a DBS too but I like the ""baby"" best in that family
New Challenger - I'll never buy one but I would Looove to rent one, even the base model.

Lowlights
X6- even worse looking in person
New WRXs
Evos - I don't love where they went with the styling this time
Jag XF- I wanted to love it but found it underwhelming
Garish stickers promting green credentials on hulking GM SUVs... give it a rest guys, no one is fooled
Saab- Total lack of relevance sadly
Mini Clubman - not really a big deal, you only gain about a foot of trunk space and you still can't carry much
Smart Car, just sit in it and try rocking from side to side... scary
SLR convertible. - Honestly most people ignored it. The new SL looks similar (new side vents) and has similar performance at 2/5 the price
Ferrari booth - lone rotating 430 with no signage (not an offically sponsored booth but still...come on that doesn't look good for them)"

21,2008-05-02T11:07:59+00:00,guss,"I did a little checking and while similar, the Matrix is more sleek, and less cute than the Yaris.


Yaris


2009 Matrix"
22,2008-05-02T13:53:00+00:00,texases,"On the Matrix, could the side windows get much smaller? Big A and C pillars, and look at how low the top of the window is. Not good :mad:"
23,2008-05-02T14:51:11+00:00,fintail,"I was thinking the same thing, thick pillars and short windows. Not cool. This design fad needs to reverse itself."
24,2008-05-02T14:55:21+00:00,british_rover,It should start reversing itself soon. IIRC The H2 and Chrysler 300 were some of the first mail slot window designs on the market. The faux four door coupe trend will probably keep the design hanging on for a few more years.
25,2008-05-02T14:57:17+00:00,ateixeira,"I hate that trend. You can barely see out of half the cars for sale today. Especially the blind spot.

Saw a new Malibu in a parking lot. Those things are loooong."
26,2008-05-02T15:07:22+00:00,guss,"I get the feeling soon it will be like driving a submarine, we'll just have cameras instead of a periscope to see where to go."
27,2008-05-02T15:21:49+00:00,ateixeira,Yes! LCD screens will replace mirrors.
28,2008-05-02T15:46:36+00:00,kyfdx,"It's local.. I've seen it a couple of times.. A truly rare sighting..

In Silver, of course"
29,2008-05-02T16:50:54+00:00,fintail,"Funny...in the pretentious area where I live, I see those pretty much every day, sometimes a few a day. I even saw a G55 last weekend, it had big heavy bling wheels :sick:

I saw a CLS63 yesterday...I've read the C63 is in release stage now, so I've been stalking the local dealer once or twice a week to see if I can spot one sitting around."
30,2008-05-02T16:52:28+00:00,ateixeira,With the new grille.
31,2008-05-03T12:43:56+00:00,andys120,"For some strange reason I was seeing new Mazda 5s everywhere I went yesterday
and then I went to a freind's house and her sister from Florida was up driving a rented Mazda 5 (!).

For what it is the 5 is an exceptionally good looking car IMO. Gas prices being what they are a Micro Minivan is probably an idea whose time has come."
32,2008-05-05T15:16:14+00:00,lemko,...seen many Toyota Yarises (Yarii?) this weekend in all kinds of colors.
33,2008-05-05T15:19:37+00:00,qbrozen,"Spotted my first For2 (or however you want to write it) on the road over the weekend. I'm shocked to have seen it in my own hometown, which is rife with things like motorhomes and Z28s (think redneck).

I was also a bit surprised at how small it really is in a real-world setting. I just don't think I could feel safe driving that thing. Its kind of like a mouse trying to navigate through the feet of stampeding elephants."
34,2008-05-05T18:22:06+00:00,ateixeira,"Too bad Mazda ignores it. I see a lot more marketing for the CX7 and CX9.

Also, they never brought over the 7 seat model, the power sliding doors, or the AWD option over from the JDM version."
35,2008-05-05T19:19:03+00:00,andys120,"Jeez, how many people really need a 7 seater? It'd be pretty crowded in a 5 w that many seats (it must be on a stretched w/b)."
36,2008-05-05T19:30:49+00:00,ateixeira,"They have a middle bench instead of the captain's chairs.

By having 5 seats with the 3rd row folded you have more cargo space because you can fold the whole 3rd row."
37,2008-05-06T16:54:00+00:00,lemko,...black Cadillac SRX. There's a guy in my neighborhood who has a new silver Pontiac G8 that I see from time to time.
38,2008-05-06T16:56:12+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw another one. Black this time.

Still very rare sightings around DC."

I'm surprised - is there a local dealer? I would have expected DC to be a fertile breeding ground for these things! I see probably two a week in Dallas."
40,2008-05-06T17:23:56+00:00,ateixeira,"Must be, but I've still only seen 2 or 3, and one might have been the last generation."
41,2008-05-06T17:40:29+00:00,bumpy,"There is still over a year-long backlog of orders even though we're getting 2/3rds of the factory output, so any given dealer is only getting a trickle of cars at any given time."
42,2008-05-06T17:50:44+00:00,texases,"Yes, I'm just surprised at how many there are around here. Two at the same time in a school parking lot!"
43,2008-05-07T03:12:40+00:00,fintail,I saw one of those new smaller Infiniti crossovers today. Yawn
44,2008-05-07T17:44:35+00:00,ateixeira,"First time I've seen a 1 series in the flesh.

Looks cute. You really notice the concavity in the sides."

46,2008-05-10T04:09:49+00:00,giancarlo51,"Saw for the first time a brand-new 2009 Acura TSX with a lip spoiler out in the wild. Boy the rear-end is simply gorgeous. The car looks a lot bigger and I think the best view of this car is from the rear, kind of like Kim Kardashian. I wasn't able to see the front-end, maybe that is why I thought it looked so good.

Saw a white Maserati Quattroporte from the rear as well, looks good too.

I also saw a Hummer H1, aren't those extinct already because of sky-high gas prices? Don't even want to guess what his gas bill is, I drive a Mazda3 and everytime I fill it up costs about 35 bucks man. Don't want to think about how much it costs to fill up a pick-up."
47,2008-05-10T21:32:57+00:00,kyfdx,"Spotted two 4-door hatchbacks yesterday...

Nice looking, but I'd be just as happy with a Mazda3 for the same (or less) money.."
48,2008-05-12T16:43:38+00:00,ateixeira,"Speaking of unusual SUVs, saw my first X6 in the flesh, and it was out on the roads.

Still looks odd to me. I prefer the X5."

0,2008-05-14T20:00:30+00:00,ateixeira,"I was walking on Pennsylvania Ave and his whole fleet drove by.

Let's see, I saw 2 Suburbans, 2 Durangos, 2 DTS Caddies, and about a dozen motorcycle cops.

First time I've seen them using Durangos, so that's new."

2,2008-05-14T20:33:03+00:00,fintail,I saw several of those in Vegas too. I think I read they cost something like 60K new.
3,2008-05-14T20:35:35+00:00,texases,"The odder thing - it was for hire as a taxi, under one of the local chains! Expensive publicity stunt, I guess."
4,2008-05-14T20:50:02+00:00,stever,You can find a similar one at a trendy boutique hotel in Santa Monica used as an airport shuttle. (link).
5,2008-05-15T01:52:10+00:00,kyfdx,I thought that looked familiar...
6,2008-05-17T18:01:07+00:00,magnette,"I saw a Hummer H2 today - totally blinged out, of course - which is not an everyday event here, even in Essex, where I was - and if it costs you 35 dollars to fill up a Mazda 3, it costs me 37 pounds, every time I fill up my Vauxhall Corsa ( a 1.2 litre diesel)."
7,2008-05-17T18:08:27+00:00,magnette,"Re the London Taxi, I read that the manufacturers are actually planning to push it in some parts of the States, as it is comparatively fuel efficient - although they are also planning to move some (ie probably all) production to China in the next few years...
That shape has actually been with us for a few years now, although the more familiar FX4 was here from 1959 to about 2002, in one form or another so taxi designs don't change much. Some bloke in our street has one, and he always seems to be heading off for his first fare at about six in the morning, so I don't really need an alarm clock if he parks outside our house..."
8,2008-05-17T19:36:43+00:00,british_rover,"For some reason I thought engines in those Taxis were really, really dirty. Is that something they fixed after 2002?"
9,2008-05-17T22:07:19+00:00,andys120,"For some reason I thought engines in those Taxis were really, really dirty. Is that something they fixed after 2002?

You haven't seen dirty til you've been in a New York Cab that's been on the street for a few months. Perhaps what you heard about is the sooty, smelly diesel exhausts the London Cabs used to emit. I assume that's a thing of the past w modern diesel tech."
10,2008-05-17T22:19:31+00:00,british_rover,Thats what I meant by dirty as in exhaust emissions not dirty like cosmetically.

Also saw a new Accord this morning.

Plus a Highlander.

Plus an X5. Looks like the old one from behind.

Also saw a base Grand Caravan, probably a fleet car. They really strip those down."

15,2008-05-20T16:42:54+00:00,lemko,I saw my first Smart yesterday travelling west on Market St. near City Hall in Philly.
16,2008-05-26T01:05:09+00:00,fintail,"I saw two new Matrix today

And a funny one... It was a new style Porsche Targa, I am not sure of the model exactly. I was driving by the local Porsche dealer, and a guy was getting into it while an employee was watching. The guy started it up with the door open, talking to the employee. The car came to life and started smoking like it was on fire, a huge amount of blue smoke was billowing out. It reminded me of my old car when a piston ring broke."

19,2008-05-27T12:56:55+00:00,lemko,...black BMW 650i coupe.
20,2008-05-31T22:16:06+00:00,giancarlo51,"New cars in and around the Seattle 206 area:

BMW M6: gorgeous

2008 Honda Accord V6 coupe: drop dead gorgeous, the 18 inch wheels look really dowdy and cheap and even small in the photos, but in person they got presence and they are hot.

A few Bentley Continentals gorgeous again"
21,2008-06-02T17:28:04+00:00,ateixeira,"An Accord gorgeous?

You're too easily impressed."
22,2008-06-04T20:02:41+00:00,kyfdx,Very nice... much better than the pictures..
23,2008-06-05T02:05:33+00:00,stickguy,"A new silver 128. Followed by (I believe they were together) an M3 coupe, still with the temp tag on it.

Seeing them back to back, the bigger car was much better proportioned. The 1 series looked too chunky.

Of course, if they had just brought over the 5 door, I would have put a deposit down on it already!

Oh, I sat in a new TSX at the dealer the other day. LOoked OK. DOn't like the grill, but the rest of the car is fine. Interior was comfy, but the center stack was a bit busy."
24,2008-06-05T16:57:03+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw one this morning also.

They had one at the mall, and I sat inside. It's nice, a step above your standard economy sedan, but not quite luxurious, either. I liked the seats. Didn't drive it, of course, the mall has too many pedestrians.

I see a Rogue about every 5 minutes.

Also saw a new Forester. We have ours on order, but these are starting to pop up a lot also. Sales were up 66% last month, no wonder I had to special order one."
25,2008-06-05T21:40:43+00:00,texases,"Juice-
Sorry to go off topic, but I'm thinking about a '05 Forester for our son - anything to look out for?"
26,2008-06-06T12:41:11+00:00,lemko,...light green metally Honda Civic hybrid. They have special wheels not seen on other Civics. I think they're quite attractive.
27,2008-06-06T13:26:18+00:00,british_rover,I think the wheels are supposed to reduce air resistance but not sure how much truth there is to that.
28,2008-06-06T14:08:20+00:00,bumpy,The full wheel covers do help reduce the drag coefficient; not much by itself but every little bit helps. The wheels are the easiest way to spot the Civic hybrids.
29,2008-06-06T14:42:10+00:00,guss,I thought the wheels on the hybrid Civic gave it a goofy spaceship look.
30,2008-06-06T15:21:06+00:00,lemko,...that Civic Hybrid would look pretty cool with some of those Bonneville Salt Flats wheels on it.
31,2008-06-06T15:55:06+00:00,stever,This one must have been from Penske - had temporary tags on it and looked brand new. The other one I've seen in Boise was likely an import from Canada or Zap.
32,2008-06-06T16:18:26+00:00,bumpy,"The new ones have two tailights on each side while the older ones have three. There are other differences (door handles, headlight shape, etc.), but that is the easiest way to distinguish them."
33,2008-06-06T19:27:57+00:00,lemko,"I spotted what appeared to be a current generation BMW 7-Series, but the lettering on the back in BMW-esque text read ""ALPINA B4."" Can anybody explain what an Alpina B4 is?"
34,2008-06-06T19:38:36+00:00,fintail,"Could it have been a ""B7""?

I remember when I was a kid someone a few blocks away had (what I guess was a)a grey market E28 5-series Alpina. It had some odd cladding and a strange paint job. I knew it was something really odd even then...I've never seen another like it."
35,2008-06-06T19:42:18+00:00,kyfdx,"Yup.. sounds like a B7..

Alpina is a BMW tuner in Germany... These are factory approved models... I think they have a supercharged V-8.. About the same price as the V-12 models..."
36,2008-06-06T20:14:15+00:00,lemko,"Yeah, it was B7. I just never seen one before."
37,2008-06-06T20:15:24+00:00,british_rover,They are pretty rare and I think just started being officially brought into the US a year or two ago.
38,2008-06-08T18:27:51+00:00,fintail,"Saw my first new face SL



I saw it driving last night too...still no C63 sitting around."
39,2008-06-09T12:55:05+00:00,lemko,"...sort of an orangish metallic GMC Acadia this morning. I guess if you don't mind paying for gas, you can get quite a deal on an SUV these days. I was at the Ford show in Carlisle and sat in a Ford F350 Superduty. Cool truck, but I'd need to own a refinery to run it."
40,2008-06-10T15:32:54+00:00,ateixeira,"Good year. Go for it.

Foresters had head gasket issues until around 2001-2002 or so, and wheel bearings were weak until they went to the sealed type for MY2003.

The 05 should be OK, but just in case...check the bottom of the block for oil stains, both the head and valve cover gaskets (4 total). Check the front and rear main seal as well, basically the seals at the front and rear of the engine.

Drive in a figure 8 with the windows open and the radio off. Odd noises would reveal any issues with the bearings, axles, AWD, differentials, etc.

If it's smooth, quiet, and leak-free, go for it. They're great cars. I had a 98, we're buying a new 2009 today, coincidentally, and my sister has a 2003. Dad has an 01 Outback and my bro has an 04 Legacy.

The funny thing is I drive a Miata and a Sienna. The Forester is my wife's car!"

Yeah, GM thought they were going to hit a home run with the Acadia/etc, only to have $4/gallon make 16-17 mpg look 'bad' compared to cars, instead of 'great' great compared to full-size SUVs."

The shape is similar, IMO the G8 is actually better looking than the E60 5-series but the Pontiac is a size and a half larger, too big for a proper sport sedan, closer in size to a 7-series."
1,2008-06-13T02:01:47+00:00,fintail,Saw my first IS-F on the road. It's noticeable...but for similar money the insane little C63 might tempt me more...
2,2008-06-15T02:04:54+00:00,bumpy,but I bet the owner wishes it were: Porsche Boxster with a huge billowing cloud of gray smoke pouring out of the back end. :sick:
3,2008-06-16T00:42:35+00:00,fintail,"Today I spotted a new style Vibe, and a new concave grille Maserati coupe.

I also saw the most hideous E63 in the world. I have seen it around a couple times,but finally was able to get a pic with the phone. No, this photo is not doctored, the color really is this bad. I guess princess wanted a fast car, and daddy has a lot more money than sense or taste."
4,2008-06-16T20:46:02+00:00,british_rover,It looks like a bad Chinese knockoff. I bet she totals it before the end of the year.

8,2008-06-18T17:17:02+00:00,guss,I saw my first C30 on the road last week. I did not like it as much as I thought I would after the auto show. Maybe it was a lower trim level.
9,2008-06-18T22:45:20+00:00,fintail,They look pretty different in low and high spec. I saw a highline model that even had fancy wheels.
10,2008-06-19T14:27:01+00:00,bumpy,"Saw a truck delivering about half a dozen Aveos to the local small-time Chevy dealer which usually sells Silverados, Tahoes, and Impalas."

Some gimmicky stuff, though... LED DRLs, which looked like someone had hung XMAS lights around the headlights..."
12,2008-06-20T16:38:38+00:00,british_rover,LED DRLs are part of the new Audi design language. It is going to be on most of the mid to high line car.

14,2008-06-23T20:40:33+00:00,boomchek,Saw a new G* at the GM dealer next to us. It was only a V6 but it was nicely priced at $37k CDN
15,2008-06-24T13:56:51+00:00,bumpy,"Yeesh. It goes for about $27k on this side of the border, and it's not like shipping from Australia to Canada is that much farther."
16,2008-06-24T15:28:24+00:00,fintail,"I've seen about 20 new Corollas in the past couple days...must be some big attraction.

Also my second G8...a high model I assume as it had a lot of cladding."
17,2008-06-24T20:17:37+00:00,ateixeira,Still odd looking to me. Looks like a gigantic hatchback.
18,2008-06-26T16:37:33+00:00,boomchek,"this morning on the way to work: a new charcoal C63 AMG. Very aggressive exhaust note.

Also a new 2009 SL in black. I'm not sure I like the new headlight design of it, from afar it looks like a SLK, up close the front, and the side fender cladding (vents behind front wheels) make it look tacky, especially on black color."
19,2008-06-26T17:12:48+00:00,fintail,"Damn, I still haven't seen a C63. My indy MB mechanic said a guy who bought one stopped by to show it off, so there's one around. I suspect they aren't sitting on the lots very long. I've heard the exhaust on youtube, it's sick...in a good way of course.

I'm not sold on the SL facelift either. It seems to be change for the sake of change."
20,2008-06-26T17:21:00+00:00,boomchek,"Out of the recent Benzes I never liked the CLS front end nor the new SL. Just really unusual headlight shape.

I too don't like change for the sake of change, but I guess it's cheaper to redo the front end rather than the whole car."
21,2008-06-27T13:45:37+00:00,lemko,Spotted a dark red metallic Chrysler Crossfire convertible last night.
22,2008-06-28T17:10:21+00:00,kyfdx,"..spotted while driving on I-26, a few miles from the BMW plant..

An X6 and a 1-series convertible.."

Looks better than in pictures. I'm not fond of the Pilot's bulldog face, and some of the plastic trim inside, but otherwise it's anice change from the old one that was getting boring to me."

I also stopped at the Honda dealer this weekend. They had one in their showroom and more on the lot. At first, as I was sitting in the showroom, I looked over and thought ""huh. why would they put a Pathfinder in their showroom.""

I really don't like it. Previous gen was much better looking. And the price has gotten up there, too. Our '03 EXL was about $31k. I checked the sticker and this EX with no leather or moonroof was over $32k. Then the dealer tacked on a bunch of crap, including $1300 running boards!"

I find Honda is notorious for overpriced accessories. I learned that when I went to work for Nissan, and then Chrysler, and found most of the stuff including running boards and spoilers to be half price."

I also really do not like the ad campaign for these things, touting it as a car for that mysterious common-as-hens-teeth demographic of ultra-successful young entrepreneurs. Most TSX I see around here are driven by middle aged women. Blaoting up the car and making it chromey won't make the 3/C/IS/G set run to it, nor those who ""start a business, sell it, and buy another"" who probably drive Ferraris, Porsches and the like.."

I agree with you but given the gas price situation I'll bet the next M3 is more like the current 335i (turbo 6) than the current M3.

The twin turbo 135i is quite the little rocket, nearly as fast as the new M3."

This was a great looking car, better looking than photos. It looks too much like an Aston but those are, after all, some of the best looking cars out there.

The 360 degree camera thing is neat, but that's looking at the glass half full. A half empty point of view might complain that they created massive blind spots in the first place. Then of course they charge you thousand of dollars to address a poor visibility issue that they basically designed-in.

Ka-ching. Infiniti cashes in on their own mistake. Sucker consumers pay extra for a needless (if visibility were OK) gadget."

23,2008-09-02T03:19:55+00:00,boomchek,"Nice a/m grille.

Saw a bunch of cars on my trip this long weekend to Whistler.

2 Aston Martin Vantages, one convertible, one coupe.
Red Pontiac G8
Orange Boxter
Two Porsche Cayannes parked under our hotel balcony: can you spot the difference?
See more Car Pictures at CarSpace.com"
24,2008-09-02T16:37:19+00:00,fintail,"The one on the right is the new one (I think). A car I care for about as much as the X6, in these parts a Cayenne is one of the ultimate posermobiles."
25,2008-09-02T17:00:11+00:00,kyfdx,"The fastback coupe, whichever one that is..

Nice, but compared to the Aston-Martin, it looks like a Vega.. :surprise:"
26,2008-09-02T17:21:48+00:00,boomchek,"Correct, the right one is the newer gen Cayenne. However I didn't go downstairs to see the diff"
27,2008-09-02T17:28:27+00:00,ateixeira,"Also, the one on the left has hood strakes so it's probably an upgraded engine option.

Why do people put fake badges on cars, who do they think they're fooling? It offends BMW owners and probably Kia owners, too."
28,2008-09-03T16:39:05+00:00,kyfdx,"The hatchback... T5 model..

In blue metallic with chrome wheels..."

Boy oh boy I hope it looks way better in real life than in photos, as that's one ugly looking car imo.

It seems as if Acura lost it's styling touch, going from beauties of the 90s (their ENTIRE model line) to these freakish lookign cars today, especially the bucktooth TSX and TL. :surprise:"

While I haven't seen one on the streets, I saw an ad for Motor Week on TV, and the shot they had of the TL driving towards me made me feel sick...no, I don't think it'll look better in the flesh..."
33,2008-09-10T14:53:50+00:00,qbrozen,"There's a new 128i sitting here in the parking lot at work with a temp tag. dark grey mettalic, black interior, and a stick shift. I still think its a good looking car. I don't know what all the complaints are about.

So the oddball today I spotted going the other way on one of the backroads I take to work. It was a scooter with 2 front wheels and 1 rear wheel. Now I know I've seen videos of those with 4 wheels, but I don't believe I've seen one with only 1 rear wheel. Seems very odd to me. I'm not sure what the advantage to that would be.

Edit:
A quick search leads me to believe it must have been one of these Vespas."
34,2008-09-10T18:26:32+00:00,ateixeira,I think they look OK minus the Transformers grille.
35,2008-09-11T03:10:45+00:00,praz,Saw a silver Passat CC in Phoenix today during rush hour.
36,2008-09-11T17:39:28+00:00,ateixeira,"Seen a few of these lately, maybe 2 or 3 of them.

Large coupes never really appealed to me - I guess I'd rather just get a sedan, or something light if I really only need 2 doors. They look OK, though. Not sexy like the G35c.

Also saw a Smart ForTwo this AM."
37,2008-09-11T18:19:40+00:00,kyfdx,I've only seen the Passat CC at car shows... Did it look like a production version that someone owns?
38,2008-09-11T22:35:28+00:00,praz,"Yes, it looked like production version and had PASSAT badge on the trunk without the CC. It looks awesome in pictures but on road it does not stand out. To be fair enough, it is much better than the TSX, Maxima, Passat and current TL. BTW, it had Dealer Perm registration of AZ so I called a dealer close to where I spotted the vehicle and they said they don't have one. Hoping to test drive one soon."
39,2008-09-13T21:37:28+00:00,stever,"I think it was an '08. Whatever - it was new to me. These must be rare birds, and TMV is $1,100 below invoice."
40,2008-09-14T11:43:26+00:00,kyfdx,"The 9-7X is just a rebadged TrailBlazer/Envoy.. But, there is no budget model.. Even with the 6-cylinder, the lowest model stickers for about $42K..

With GM employee pricing, and the $8000 rebate, you can take one home for under $30K...

If you don't mind 14 mpg city.. :surprise:"
41,2008-09-14T14:42:25+00:00,stever,"Yeah, I knew it was a rebadge. It's just the only one I've ever seen. I bet they don't sell 5,000 copies a year.

Did I mention that I spotted a new 08 Grand Caravan? Last week I got a free upgrade from a Caliber to one so I got to drive it a week (I really wanted the Caliber, knowing how highly you thought of the rental Bob had in Santa Monica last year ).

I was enjoying the Caravan until my sister riding shotgun asked if something was wrong with the tires or something or did they all roll that much."
42,2008-09-15T17:57:06+00:00,ateixeira,"Finally saw one. They seem pretty small to me.

Also saw a new Vue and a Corolla.

Oh, and saw my first Lincoln MKX. The wife liked it. I feel mixed about it."
43,2008-09-15T18:29:34+00:00,boomchek,"Oh, and saw my first Lincoln MKX. The wife liked it. I feel mixed about it.

I'm not a big fan of the Edge or MKX either. They are kinda huge and expensive for limited use SUVs that don't stand out that much, or that don't have any unique qualities imo."
44,2008-09-15T19:08:03+00:00,fintail,"Yesterday I saw a Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, today I saw a 599 Fiorano, along with a facelift Cayenne and a facelift SL63. Some people must still be a little cash flush...or they just decided to cash out of a collapsing investment market and buy some toys."
45,2008-09-17T18:37:56+00:00,lemko,...white Dodge Challenger on Woodhaven Road near the Franklin Mills Mall in NE Philly.
46,2008-09-17T23:03:31+00:00,bksward,Orange one in a parking lot at one of the Visitor Centers at Grand Teton NP about 2 weeks ago...
47,2008-09-19T02:02:30+00:00,lemko,...black Bentley Arnage T in the next lane over on my way home from work. What was more unusual was it's driver - a young blond-haired guy in his 20s with a white baseball cap worn sideways. Either I just saw Eminem or somebody's got a really generous or trusting father.
48,2008-09-19T02:23:16+00:00,boomchek,"Could have been a rocker from some famous band, loaded snowbaorder or skater, actor, or like you said a random guy with a generous father.

Saw aSLR McLaren today in a MB showroom. What was different was that tghis one was a convertible. I thought they weren't out yet."
49,2008-09-19T02:58:42+00:00,fintail,"Yeah I have seen a SLR roadster on the road here too. They've trickled in. I wonder where resale values for those will be in 10 years...

Bentley boy could also have just been some random pro athlete, lots of teams in Philly. Or maybe dad owns a highline dealership.

My new car sighting today was an 09 Fit in kind of an orange metallic...not the best color."
0,2008-09-22T02:00:40+00:00,fintail,Spotted a new Mazda 6 today....it's a noticeable change.
1,2008-09-22T13:05:32+00:00,lemko,"...some for the first time: silver Hyundai Genesis, light blue metallic Jaguar XF, medium gray metallic BMW 1-Series, white Mercedes-Benz CLS550, maroon Cadillac XLR."
2,2008-09-22T19:49:03+00:00,ateixeira,"Agreed, big change. Literally, the car is huge.

I went to test drive a Miata and sat in one real quick.

The back seat is a lot roomier but you have to duck to get in the back seat.

I have mixed feelings, especially since they ditched the 5 door and wagon."
3,2008-09-22T19:58:41+00:00,fintail,"A friend of mine has a 5-door, V6 model, I think it is an 04 or an 05. They like it and have had no problems with it, although IMO some of the interior finishes are harsh. But the average consumer doesn't notice things like that. It's versatile and they got it for a decent price.

The new one kind of looks like it could be a 5-door, but it's just a big sedan. The whole flared/bulging fender thing to make a mass-market car look aggressive is iffy too...I am sure I will have something to say when I see my first new Maxima."
4,2008-09-22T20:03:54+00:00,ateixeira,"I agree about the interior, actually, plus it was just too close in size to the Mazda3 5 door, which is boxier and probably had more head room.

I like the fenders because it mimicks the RX8. The miata hints at it, too, only on a smaller scale."
5,2008-09-23T00:41:27+00:00,fintail,"The new one sure looks bigger than a 3.

There's a common design theme yeah...I guess I just find it funny when cars that will in most cases be put into duty by middle-of-the-road types who aren't car enthusiasts try to look sporty and aggressive."
6,2008-09-23T04:10:18+00:00,texases,"""I guess I just find it funny when cars that will in most cases be put into duty by middle-of-the-road types who aren't car enthusiasts try to look sporty and aggressive. ""

This whole 4-door coupe thing is getting nuts - either there's not a lot of headroom in the back seat of the new 6, or you're sitting on the floor :sick:"
7,2008-09-23T15:26:56+00:00,fintail,"I can't imagine tall people fitting well back there. Even in the 5-door 6 my friend has, I think it is tight...I swear I rode back there once and if I leaned back I ran out of room.

Is the little window looking thing in the C-pillar an actual window, or just decoration? Asian design seems to love an upward kick at the end of a window line. But hell, it's better looking than a Camry anyway."
8,2008-09-23T15:43:23+00:00,ateixeira,"Like I said, I had to duck to get in.

Headroom is actually OK, I'm 6"" and had a couple of inches to spare above my head.

The seat is low, though.

The car looks better in person, though I'd say that about a lot of cars."
9,2008-09-29T01:19:06+00:00,fintail,"Today I saw a facelift Cayenne, a new Maxima (front end is weird IMO) and most noteworthy, what I am pretty sure was a Bentley Brooklands Coupe...it was behind me in traffic and made a u-turn and I barely caught a glimpse as I just assumed it was an Arnage behind me (not an unknown sight here), but it was a coupe and looked smaller than the big old 90s Continental."
10,2008-09-30T21:08:26+00:00,andys120,"I Isaw a new Maxima the other day too, I thought it looked good, perhaps the best looking Maxima yet."
11,2008-09-30T21:42:14+00:00,fintail,"I've always thought the 89-94 models were the cleanest looking, if maybe a little dull (but not bad for the time). I see too many weird creases and curves today, existing simply for the sake of having creases and curves. Bangle, you're a [non-permissible content removed]."
12,2008-09-30T22:32:25+00:00,boomchek,"lol, I agree with you on the 89-94 maxim looking the best. The generation that followed lost all of it's sporty looks imo, and became another round looking mid size sedan."
13,2008-10-01T00:51:23+00:00,fintail,"The one that came after the ""4DSC"" was such a bland design, like the kind of debadged car you see in insurance commercials. I guess they were pretty reliable and sturdy though. The one that came after that, for MY 2000 I think, was the oddest in my eyes, like three different designs in one."
14,2008-10-01T14:22:05+00:00,lemko,"...two Lincoln MKS - one black, one white. The first time I've seen them in the ""wild."""
15,2008-10-01T18:31:06+00:00,andys120,"I've seen a couple of those MKSs, they're a lot sexier than Town Cars."
16,2008-10-02T18:43:41+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw my first one outside of the car show arena. Looked good, orange.

It was owned by the service writer at the local Mazda/VW dealer.

While I was there, I also sat in a Tiguan (too small) and also saw a Routan.

Funny thing about the Routan - the Monroney said it had alloy wheels, but this model had cheap plastic wheel covers over what seemed to me like black steel rims. I pointed it out to the salesmen, who didn't seem to mind.

How about some quality control, VW? Wrong wheels, seriously?

I went there 4 days later to pick up my Miata (had some body work done) and the same sticker was still on that van, so apparently noone cares."
17,2008-10-03T03:11:34+00:00,fintail,"I saw 2 MB badged Sprinters today. I know the Sprinter is not new, but are they coming with the star already attached now?

I also saw 2 new Fits."
18,2008-10-03T11:25:50+00:00,guss,"The Sprinter had a Mercedes star and a Dodge name plate ? That is weird.

My company bought a Sprinter 3 years ago and it is tough enough already to get a union member to drive it , I am sure within a week the star would disappear."
19,2008-10-03T15:12:45+00:00,kyfdx,"Sprinters come badged as MB, Dodge or Freightliner..

Don't think there are any actual differences, other than the badges.."
20,2008-10-03T21:13:05+00:00,fintail,"Today I spotted a new M3 Cabrio and a C63 parked within a couple blocks of each other.

Also, I saw a Genesis...caught the corner of my eye, and without looking at it couldn't decide if it was an Accord or a BMW. So I had to look closer, and I saw what it was. It does have an upmarket look."
21,2008-10-03T22:01:06+00:00,boomchek,"Fintail, you always seem to spot the nice high end stuff.

I actually saw a VW Phaeton today, and a slammed new M5 with chrome deep dish rims yesterday.

New 2009 Ram just arrived as well to our showrooms. Not bad looking truck."
22,2008-10-04T01:22:17+00:00,fintail,"Too many people around here with a bit more money than sense, methinks.

I like the C63 a lot for what it offers, but I think AMG cars have lost one of their key values - subtlety.

I see a Phaeton parked on a street near where I live from time to time. They look like a used bargain. Locally I saw an 04 W12 model for under 20K."
23,2008-10-04T07:30:26+00:00,boomchek,"I'd hate to run into problems with a Phaeton though. I wonder what the advanced electrnics cost to fix. It's pricey enough in a run of the mill Jetta, let a lone a flagship. :surprise:"
24,2008-10-04T17:39:13+00:00,fintail,"Audi parts availiability combined with VW service, sure to be fun as the car ages."
25,2008-10-04T18:59:54+00:00,boomchek,"Especially stuff like the draft free quad zone electronic climate
control. I bet if the system goes it would cost as muich as a decent used car to fix. :surprise: :lemon:"
26,2008-10-04T20:24:08+00:00,fintail,"I think those cars have a few application-specific bits that will eventually die and never be fixed. Imagine a 15 year old Phaeton with 150K miles on it, needing HVAC and engine management work."
27,2008-10-05T02:59:52+00:00,lemko,"I imagine at least 2 tons of very prestigious scrap metal.

I saw a 1988 Rolls-Royce Corniche at the Fall Carlisle meet for sale. A sign taped to the windshield claimed ""$10,000 in mechanical repairs recently completed."" What did he have done? A brake job, an oil change and maybe a radiator flush?"
28,2008-10-06T00:47:11+00:00,fintail,You're probably not far off on that

32,2008-10-09T17:06:00+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw my first new model on the roads. Looks better in person than it does in photos.

Basically looks like they modernized the old one...an evolutionary update. Which is exactly what they should have done."
33,2008-10-09T17:08:46+00:00,qbrozen,"I've been seeing those for about 9 months, maybe more. I guess its just more popular in my area? Although I can't figure out why. Fugly hummer-inspired styling, heavy, bad mileage, low power, etc, etc."

38,2008-10-20T17:17:13+00:00,boomchek,"I'm seeing the all over the place. Saw 3 new ones on Sunday.

Also saw an orange Lambo Gallardo with an N sign in the back. In BC, N signs signify New Drivers (both young and old that just got their license).

The driver of the Gallardo looked like an 18 year old (lucky bum!). He pulled off into an expensive nighbourhood."
39,2008-10-20T17:56:10+00:00,fintail,"I've noticed quite a few new style Fits around here too. If I had one I think I would rebadge it as a Jazz.

I bet the Lambo has some ""custom bodywork"" within 6 months or so :sick:"

Makes for a different kind of bodywork."

46,2008-10-21T14:48:56+00:00,ateixeira,"And I saw a soft top one this morning.

What bothered me about that car is that the hard top's window is no bigger than the soft top. That's lame. Visibility isn't any better than with the soft top.

Look at the Miata - the hard top is totally different. The rear window is both wider and closer to the driver, so visibility is notably better with the top up. Chrysler should have done the same thing.

I saw a new Fit as well, plus one of those new Jag sedans."
47,2008-10-24T02:04:25+00:00,fintail,"Spotted another Genesis in traffic today...same color as the one I saw a few weeks ago so I suppose it could be the same one, but it was about 15 miles away. Strangely enough, the driver looked Korean, too. Also saw a MKS."
48,2008-10-24T03:05:14+00:00,boomchek,"A subaru Impreza STi, pulled up to our showroom.

I like the bulging fenders, quad exhaust, the wheels, and the interior seats. Really nice all around package. Silver color too."
49,2008-10-24T13:15:06+00:00,guss,"I saw it from behind and thought it was a new Acura because Acuras have gone weird now. Well, at least the MKS is something different from the usual Lincolns, I can't say I loved it but it was OK at best."

However, the LED DRLs have got to go... They are so hokey looking... Plus, whenever they use the turn signal, the one on that side goes out.. :surprise:"

I got a good look at a Hyundai Azera today and I was pretty impressed by the quality of the (silver) paint as well as the tight shutlines . I wonder why it doesn't sell better as it would seen a good alternative to buyers of Centuries, Sables and the like."

I remember when in early 90s I had a buyer's guide and there was a picture of an Aston Martin Virage interior, and the steering wheel was straight out of the Taurus."

Here's a '92 - different wheel.

Here's a '95 with a suspicious looking wheel. :shades:"
20,2008-11-21T22:12:48+00:00,fintail,Ouch! That's just shameful.
21,2008-11-21T23:47:15+00:00,boomchek,"Yes way Fintail.. I think the Astons that were sold in markets that required a driver's side airbag, came with the FoMo corporate wheel. Probably cheaper to install then to reengineer a new one.

If I'd be the owner the first thing I'd do is swap it for a Momo wheel or something.

This is not the first time that an exotic shared parts with a lowline car.

Check this out: Lotus Esprit vs Saturn SC1 coupe."
22,2008-11-22T02:54:02+00:00,fintail,"I can see sharing parts, like Ferraris that have had Fiat switchgear...but the steering wheel! For all that money couldn't something exclusive be designed?

I always thought it was amusing that early MB R129 have the same steering wheel as later W126 cars, but those ones you post are just insane. I honestly had no idea about that Aston or the Lotus."
23,2008-11-22T17:32:22+00:00,boomchek,"Yeah it's funny. Good thing it has sorta went away.

I think the big reason the steering wheels were shared was for the airbags, as initially they were big and bulky, and you wouldn't be able to fit one in a smaller sports type steering wheel.

The Aston/Taurus steering is probably the most extreme and ugliest example of parts sharing."
24,2008-11-22T18:11:42+00:00,fintail,"That Taurus wheel irks me...my mom had a Taurus of the generation that had that wheel, and although it dodged the common maladies (trannies and head gaskets)...it wasn't exactly a leather lined luxo cruiser like the Aston is supposed to be. I can't imagine any of those still wear that wheel...if the owner realizes where it came from, anyway.

Does anything like that exist today at all?"
25,2008-11-22T19:06:20+00:00,boomchek,"Maybe secretly, the Taurus owners bought these cars to feel like they're in an Aston"

I did find out that the stock tires on my new AWD Subie are really crappy in the snow... which makes no sense at all.

Messing around with my son... driving down the street... almost took out a neighbor's mailbox... :surprise: So much for fun in the snow.."
38,2008-12-08T21:28:51+00:00,imidazol97,">. Can't really see someone switching out for winters on a Lotus..

I asked the local Ford dealer a couple years back about the GT they had in the showroom and if snowtires were available for it. I'd imagine it's like driving a Firebird on snow.

The salesman didn't seem very amused. Maybe that's why they're closed."

0,2009-01-13T22:11:58+00:00,andys120,All of my ambivalence about the styling of this car disappeared with the sight of this jet black GT-R. It's amazing what coat of shiny black paint will do for the looks of a car about which you are ambivalent. I've noticed the BMW 1-series coupe which looks a little tallish and/or cutesy in other colors looks sensational in black.
1,2009-01-18T00:23:43+00:00,andys120,"I saw a silver four-door backing out of a space and at first thought it was an E60 BMW 5 Series and I'm thinking ""If you don't see the nose, that's a good-looking car"".

Then he came around towards me and I could see that it was no Fiver but the new Hyundai Genesis and it was indeed a good-looking car for lacking the visual trauma of the E60's nose but retaing the clean sides and roofline.

Thus it is pretty generic but quite handsome in it's way."

A mess of random angles and edges, the weird grille, the somehow unhappy greenhouse...it's like a Japanese version of Art + Science, but a lot less unified.

4,2009-01-21T18:34:59+00:00,boomchek,"The 04-08 is indeed very nice looking. Even the generation ebfore that I enjoyed.

I agree with you on the new TL. I think there's a lot more ""handomse"" luxury vehicles out there in this class.

Lexus ES, Infiniti G or even M.

I'd actually even get a Hyundai Azera or Genesis over the new TL."

I think all their names come from the African desert (remember Scirocco?)."

Golf, Scirroco and, Jeta, Bora and Passat were all names of winds that originate in North Africa and blow across the Mediterranean into Europe. Maserati also used the same naming convention in the 70s- Ghibli, Khamsin and Bora were all winds from Northern Africa.

The Toureg was named after a tribe of nomads from Morroco and Mauretania. I think they just made Tiguan up.-they could've used Bedouin or Berber."
8,2009-01-21T23:02:46+00:00,fintail,"All of those look better than the new TL, for sure. It's just such a disjointed design, harsh for the sake of being harsh."
9,2009-01-21T23:45:04+00:00,fintail,"Lots of new E-class pics have been releases

I don't like it. It's funny how the Asian makers for so long have copied German styling, and now the Germans copy Asian copies of German styling. What a horrible cycle! Look at those Hyundai taillights...inexcusable. Maybe proof that Europe is going downhill..."
10,2009-01-22T00:52:53+00:00,boomchek,"I can't believe the E class is already due for a redesign. Has it been that long? Time flies.....

As for the styling I was going to say the same thing. The tail lights look like they came off a Genesis.

I don't mind the looks, but I agree with you. Mercedes looks like it ran out of styling ideas about 10 years ago. The C Class looks nice, the S Class is new but nothing that blows other luxury sedan away in the styling dept, and this E Class is ok I guess.

I do like it in the chocolate brown color, I think it look very elegant."
11,2009-01-22T02:16:32+00:00,fintail,"W211 was introduced for the 2003 model year, was in Europe by spring of 02. It's getting pretty old.

I don't mind the C, and parts of the S, but this E with its wannabe Asian styling doesn't warm my heart. Jeez I miss the days of cars like the W124, such competent solid designs, not needing gimmicks and derivative cliches.

Not many cars can pull off brown."
12,2009-01-22T03:59:49+00:00,boomchek,"I agree with you on the W124. I think my fav is the W140. I know most people though it was bloated and heavy looking, but it had presence, even the big coupe.

The W126 would be my second place choice as one of the modern Benzes that had presence."
13,2009-01-22T04:51:15+00:00,fintail,"I used to like the W140, then I didn't, now I am appreciating it a little...maybe as it is heading for 20 years old now. The coupes always had a strange interest for me, such a big bulky thing, very odd, but it pulled it off, maybe not as well as the 126 coupe. Bruno Sacco owns a beautiful blue C140.

I see the W126 as pretty much a perfect design, I can't imagine MB or anyone else repeating something so balanced and timeless. Modern cars don't seem to bother with simple elegance."
14,2009-01-22T19:05:27+00:00,lemko,"Sheesh! Until I saw the three-pointed star, I thought I was looking at a concept car for the Lexus GS! What's with those goofy taillights? They DO look more Korean than German.

Someboduy visiting a next door neighbor pulled up in a black W126 S-Class. That is still a sharp-looking car to this day!"

16,2009-01-22T19:43:48+00:00,boomchek,I like the first and mildly redesigned second gen Lexus LS too. Very hansome lines imo.
17,2009-01-22T20:33:01+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, I don't mind those either, they were derivative of something good. Lots of them still out there too, so they have proven themselves.

The 01-06 (I think) design has to be a derivative of the W140, too. It wasn't quite as decent looking, a big isolation tank.

The current pretentious model does nothing for me, although I should give credit that it is finally its own design."

Odd front (especially in black, I imagine silver would conceal the grille surround), odd front fender bump, odd rear side window, heavy looking rear trunk, narrow/slanted rear window. The Genesis looked fine, nothing that offended, clean lines. If I had to choose between those two it'd be the Genesis. I'll be going to the Dallas car show in two weeks, I'll compare the Genesis to the CTS."

The TL really is a train wreck.

Local MB dealer has half a dozen GLKs sitting on the lot now. Not worthy of me snapping a pic...the world doesn't need more dopey little SUVs."

30,2009-02-09T14:20:13+00:00,lemko,...dark blue Maserati Quattroporte at Rhawn and Bustleton in NE Philly.
31,2009-02-09T14:46:11+00:00,texases,At least the Venza's styling is an improvement over Toyota's previous station wagons. They seemed to have a knack for some odd styling on the Camrys. Corollas were OK.

The grille is a bit overdone.

It might make sense to someone shopping for a Lexus RX that wants to spend a bit less."
34,2009-02-09T17:40:04+00:00,fintail,"I was thinking the same, it has a strong resemblance to a RX but probably costs 40% less. It'll probably sell quite a few on that alone.

I'll take a weirdo Toyota over a boring one. Bizarro dual rear wiper Camry wagons and strange boxy 4WD Corollas are almost exotics in a world of pigsnout Camrys and Matrix (or Matrices?)"
35,2009-02-09T17:42:37+00:00,ateixeira,"Yup. Dealers near me have well equipped models from $31k or so and up.

42,2009-02-09T18:19:43+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Yeah, I'm not really a fan of that one. Too Generic.

There are a few neat styling touches on the Venza that I think sets it apart from the Nissan or the Ford. Most notably the rear with the Volvo-esque tailight treatment and the contouring on the hatch. And the Grill, while a bit overdone I think it works with the overall design and is inlike anything else out there. I might even go so far as to call the Venza styling ""Bold"" or even ""Daring"" (Ducks behind computer screen) I also like the cockpit dash layout and the interior has a really rich look to it in higher trim levels. I think it's classier than the new Highlander even.

I mean, the Venza isn't rolling excitment, but it has a bit more style than more recent models. I'd like to think that this is at least a sign that Toyota is going to add a bit more styling to the budget on future models."
43,2009-02-09T18:20:49+00:00,ateixeira,"I know what you mean. Even though I don't like the grille, I do prefer the Venza over the Zio, and that's probably because of the risks they took."

That one was loaded save for the engine, and the dealer still had the nerve to put a $999 ADM on it in this economy. Idiots. They also had a barebones version. It's a pretty elegant car all in all, and an interior that's exceptional looking even for VW.

Stopped by the BMW dealer, they had a smattering of lowline 1 series coupes, kind of odd to see them not loaded up. Audi dealer had a loaded RS4 with some kind of titanium trim package that looked pretty mean. They also had a CPO 07 S6 and S8 side by side...those can't be common.

Another dealer carries some odd makes, had a trio of Spykers in the showroom, including a convertible - never seen one of those before."
46,2009-02-16T18:21:38+00:00,boomchek,"The Passat CC is a nice looking car, but for the money I think there are other nice alternatives.

Yesterday I saw a new Jag XF black on black, looked really stunning. Driven by a upper class looking older lady leav9ing the liquor store parking lot. As we were leaving the store, the bums in front of the store were admiring it too out loud.

It's one of the nicest sedans out there right now imo."

Therein lies the problem IMO, they tried too hard to make the S and X-Types look like MkIIs and ended up with dated looking cars out of the box. Methinks they tried too hard to come up with a contemporary look for the XF and ended up squeezing the ""jaguaricity"" out of the XF.

OTOH, if they'd reshape those headlights they might have something."

positive: its unique and stands out

negative: its very tall (was behind it as we drove past many other cars, and it seemed to fall just between a minivan and 300C). And what the heck is up with the upturned rearend? I could see everything up to and including the rear suspension. Very unattractive from that angle and once the exhaust pipes start to gather rust, it will look HORRIBLE."

5,2009-03-03T19:12:31+00:00,ateixeira,"Really?

I guess I didn't realize the Passat had crept up in price so much.

On the new car front I saw another new TL yesterday. That design is just a mess. The TSX can almost carry it, but the TL is a nightmare compared to the nice looking previous model."

Same reaction to the TL at the Dallas car show. One other bad trend-instead of shiney chrome-plated plastic grilles, lots of makers are now going to matte-finished chrome work. Didn't look good to me. :lemon:"
8,2009-03-03T20:19:35+00:00,fintail,"I have noticed the TL kind of carries the hokey shield design at front and back, while the sides are forgettable blandness. Did Honda hire the Aztek design crew?

The matte finish chrome, which usually looks like plain old silver paint, doesn't give an air of quality."
9,2009-03-03T20:23:33+00:00,texases,"I'm going to give Acura the benefit of the (great) doubt - lots of cars are now showing up with tall grilles and hoods, thanks to the EU. I wonder if the Acura ""shield"" is part of meeting those pedestrian crash requirements? Like the 'nose' on many recent Toyotas? (equally ugly, to me)"
10,2009-03-03T20:26:38+00:00,fintail,"I think the TL might be a NA-market-only product, or maybe NA and Japan...I don't know of they are sold in Europe. I know the RL exists there, but it isn't offensive. I believe they are just trying to develop a corporate styling theme, like the Europeans have done for generations...although I am sure the ugly high front does help in dubious pedestrian regulations."
11,2009-03-03T20:33:45+00:00,boomchek,"I haven't seen too many of the new TLs, at least not up close to be able to have a good look.

I'll reserve my judgement to when I go to our Auto Show. The trunk lid crease though reminds me of the old CL coupe."

That rear shield...I just can't like it. What's the point of that?

Oh yeah, the auto show is coming in a few weeks...I'll be coming to Van for that too"

15,2009-03-03T20:55:04+00:00,fintail,"My theory behind it all is that BMW has seen massive success with questionable designs that are pretty much different for the sake of being different. Acura wants to see if this can help them now.

These just aren't cohesive designs."
16,2009-03-03T21:04:17+00:00,boomchek,"Also I don't know if I read it here, but I heard the trunk access into ther TL is inconvenient due to the shape of the trunk lid.

Let me know which day you'll be down here fintail, maybe I'll run into you at the show."
17,2009-03-03T21:10:09+00:00,fintail,"I'll be there for several days, an acquaintance of mine has a vacant condo near there they rent out now and then, so I have it for about a week, a nice mini-holiday. Are you working the show, or does your dealership do that?"
18,2009-03-03T21:13:53+00:00,boomchek,"Our dealership had a day allocated at the show last year and I worked it. However this year the show has been cut to only 5 days I think, so not sure if we get a day. I usually end up going 2-3 times every year anyways, so there's a good chance we can meet there."
19,2009-03-03T21:20:29+00:00,fintail,"Do you actually sell anything via the show?

I noticed on the website it's shorter this year. Somehow I prefer it to the Seattle show...easier access to the highline cars, and the venue is more fun. I have that entire week free, so something will work."

That was my thought when I saw one."
21,2009-03-03T22:45:39+00:00,boomchek,"By law we're not supposed to doi any transactions at the show, so no, we can't sell.

Last year a customer wanted to buy a Cahllenger, so we whisked him back to our dealership where he laid a fat deposit on one."
22,2009-03-03T23:20:49+00:00,stever,You mean the dealer is afraid that the buyer could try the three day cooling off period rule and try to back out of the sale if a car was sold at the show? I don't think that's an issue from some links I found a year or so ago. link
23,2009-03-03T23:27:34+00:00,kyfdx,"In Ohio, dealers aren't permitted to sell off-site.. (including the car show) I always assumed that it had something to do with the three day, right of recission laws..

However, in KY, the local dealer association will have a big ""tent sale"", anywhere there is a huge parking lot (university, race track), and all of the dealers will trundle their stock over there, and can sell freely.

Just two examples.."
24,2009-03-03T23:50:33+00:00,fintail,"Probably a tough venue to get a sale anyway...so many lookie-loos. Of course, if one is spending $10 to look at cars, a few might be serious.

Maybe I will ask the MB guys weird technical questions about the cars and receive puzzled looks in return....that's always fun. Either that or asking when each model will finally come here in diesel form."
25,2009-03-04T00:04:29+00:00,boomchek,"No it's not that. We don't have a cooling off period in British Columbia. We (dealers) are governed by a motor dealer council that isseus licenses to premises and salespeople selling cars. A dealer that wants to sell off site, like at an auto show, needs to apply for a seperate license which in most cases is not worth the money time and hassle just for a 5 day show.

Hence there is no selling at the auto show.

It's easier to bring the customer from the show to our dealership. Or to take their name and number. Besides the vehicles at the show are usually not dealer owned, but manufacturer owned and travel across counrty during the show season, so we cna't even sell those if we wanted to."
26,2009-03-04T00:41:28+00:00,stever,"Ok, but why are you there if you aren't ""selling""?

Seriously, are you paid to attend and do you hang out at the cars your dealer sells to answer questions and chat folks up? (I don't want to know if you have to wear an evening gown and heels :P )."

31,2009-03-04T15:51:15+00:00,ateixeira,"I think it peaked at least one generation ago.

I can see why they want a family resemblance, but I don't like chrome and they seem to have a lot of it, and the fake stuff at that."

Stormy Blue Mica, hard top, Touring with the suspension package.

Basically the sportiest Miata you can get - 6 speed manual, Bilstein shocks, uprated springs, fatter roll bar (PRHT's front anti-roll bar is bigger than the soft top's), Torsen limited-slip rear differential, summer tires on upsized 17"" rims.

I took a look at it during lunch and the exterior is too extreme to go with the base wheels and tires. I think the Type S trim works better here. The interior is fantastic though, and a definite upgrade over the outgoing model. The seats, the ergonomics, the drivers view is excellent. The only thing I don't like about it is the rear view is tricky with the raised boattail, and the long nose which is tough to judge. I'm not toally enamoured with it, but I don't find it offensive. Once the Type-S AWD, 6-spd comes out, I'll definitely take a more serious look at it.

Also, the Venza seems to be selling very well around here, and based on this link, it satnds as the #3 ""mover"".

It's a good sign that so many higher priced vehicles are popular, maybe it's a good sign for the economy."
6,2009-03-19T00:32:41+00:00,berri,Isn't it ironic that the Venza seems like it will be a hit while the Chrysler Pacifica and Taurus X were essentially marketplace failures? I wonder how Honda's entry next year will fare?

ELGIN, Ill. - He freely admitted that his dream car is a red Nissan Altima with a push-button ignition. A 21-year-old man was charged Monday with burglary and attempted theft for allegedly trying to steal one from a Nissan auto dealership. Police said the man saw the car on the showroom floor around midnight on Sunday.

Police said he broke in and started the car, but couldn't find a way to get it out of the building. Police said he then broke a showroom window, but was unable to maneuver the auto out the building.

He was discovered a short time later by police, who arrested him"

I had a nice laugh."

16,2009-03-25T17:36:13+00:00,boomchek,"Sometimes it's funny when journalists pretend like they know what they're talking about but they really don't. Once our local paper did a story on modified cars but the terminology used by the reported didn't make sense.

17,2009-03-25T20:11:03+00:00,ateixeira,"Funny.

Speaking of which, I saw a Tiguan at White Flint Mall on Saturday.

Those things look sooooo small. Our Forester dwarfs it."

Very odd proportions. It has a big greenhouse yet it's stubby, sort of like a short guy with a big head.

I have yet to see the new Volvo but I actually look forward to it, as those are attractive."

28,2009-04-02T06:02:54+00:00,boomchek,"Thanks for meeting me there Fintail. We had a good chat about cars in general as we strolled through the show. Here's some observations:

Ford: If the Fiesta and the Transit van are previews to what's coming soon from Ford, the company should fare really well through these times.

Saab: Some ok products, but most are long in the tooth like the 9-5. The 9-7X, although I don't recall seeing one there, it's still in thier brochures. I'd drop it as it's based on an outdated model (old Trailblazer) noteven sold by GM anymore.

Sitting in the MB S Class: The centre screen on the dash, that looks in photos like it blocks the view ahead, is not that obtrusive in real life.

Volvo XC60 wood/leather steering wheel still looks like a $5 aftermarket cover.

Mazda3 mouth: Looks better in real life than in pics, but still too big for my tastes.

Kia Soul: pretty funky for an entry level car.

Nissan Cube: Funky looking too outside but plain compact car look inside.

Nissan Versa sedan bottom feeder: I agree with Fintail, the shape looks like a Dacia Logan, especially with the cheap outside trim, and no radio or a/c. But for $12495 CDN what can you expect?

Hyundai Genesis: still love the looks, and price wise it's a bargain to german luxury cars of same size (5 series, E class).

Mistu Lancer Sportback: loaded with every option priced at $39495. Nuff said :surprise:

Camaro: ok, small athletic looking, but not a head turner in my opinion.

Spyker: cool and different. First time I have seen one.

Acura TL: That plastic metallic trim outside will look like crap after it wears out from use and weather. Very odd shapes and proportions and grille. What were they thinking.

Infiniti FX: I dont like the front end looks. Weird."
29,2009-04-02T06:35:29+00:00,stever,"Kia Soul: pretty funky for an entry level car.

Is that funky in a good way or bad?"
30,2009-04-02T12:16:19+00:00,lemko,Spotted a silver Saturn Sky and a black Cadillac XLR this morning on my way to work.
31,2009-04-02T15:49:58+00:00,fintail,"Yeah it was cool. As you said once, had we known each other when we were kids, we would have been very good friends. And at least a few automakers are still printing brochures for your hoard :P

Something funky about the Soul I noticed is that there is an interior trim that has ""Soul Soul Soul"" printed over and over on the seats. A friend of mine has some Camaro promotional material from around 1983, and it had a seating option that said ""Camaro Camaro Camaro"" over and over on the seats. So, that's what came to mind when I saw the Kia.

And speaking of the Camaro, I have to say I sensed a slight rattle when closing the door with the window down. I didn't notice this in other frameless doors. It's really a retro car then!

The Fiesta and Transit vans were pretty cool. The NA market dearly needs the cool Euro material.

The weird rear window dip on the Genesis coupe isn't nearly as annoying in person as it is in photos. But, that non-metallic red the loaded model was in is a bad choice.

It's good to see that MB hasn't lost any appeal compared to the rest.

And I have to agree about the TL....it's just such a disjointed design. And what gets me the most is that I see them now and then, so someone is buying them."
32,2009-04-02T17:31:29+00:00,boomchek,"Funky in a good way. And speaking of Kia, they also had their new Forte sedan. It's nice to see at least that driving an entry level sub compact these days is not as embarassing as it used to be. At least the cars look the part.

Oh, yeah, forgot one more... the MB GLK. Still not so nice in real life. Looks like a Mercedes version of the first gen Subaru Forester, as someone pointed out on Edmunds I think,"
33,2009-04-02T17:39:33+00:00,boomchek,"Yeah brochures are getting scarce.

I need to go on their websites and order a bunch for the manufacturers that didn't have any. Now that they're made to order, there's gonna be even fewer of them meaning my gigatic collection should fetch a few bucks in about 10-20 years, if like I mentioned to you at the show, I won't have to use them for a fire to keep me warm during post nuclear war. :P"
34,2009-04-02T18:15:03+00:00,fintail,"The Spyker brochure you managed to get has potential to be a minor collectible, I'd think.

As automakers are going ""green"" (read: cheap) and printing less brochures these days, modern literature will probably be less common than older material. You're paying virtually nothing for your collection...so there are certainly worse ways to spend a little time.

Be sure to get one for that Dacia Logan Nissan, too :shades:"
35,2009-04-02T18:18:52+00:00,boomchek,"One thing I would like to start collecting is press kits for new car releases that media gets. Usually they got a bunch of photos, slides, brochures, and other interesting history. Wilkinsons has some but I haven't really had a chance to look into them closely."
36,2009-04-02T22:19:47+00:00,fintail,"I stopped by Wilkinsons today - the guy there offered to get some brochures for me to look at, but I already have all I want for my cars."
37,2009-04-03T04:42:10+00:00,boomchek,"I should stop by and support them,. It might be hard to stay afloat during these times."
38,2009-04-03T17:06:28+00:00,fintail,"There was actually a steady stream of people there when I stopped by. One guy bought a vintage diecast and another placed an order for an upcoming model, so combined with my purchase, they sold a little anyway.

I can't think of another shop like that for at least 1000 miles around here, so they might actually be in good shape."
39,2009-04-03T17:23:56+00:00,lemko,Does this place have a website? I'd be interested in some of those really nice Dinky diecasts.

41,2009-04-03T17:37:09+00:00,lemko,Cool site! Thanx!
42,2009-04-06T02:06:02+00:00,fintail,"Saw a late model Z06 at a gas station today. Looked special, sounded very nice, driver was the old Corvette stereotype from 30 years ago.

47,2009-04-13T19:31:50+00:00,ateixeira,"It's a 2+2 yet it's heavy and kinda big.

I bet a Mini Cooper Clubman has more space."
48,2009-04-13T20:44:17+00:00,qbrozen,"That's exactly what they are, hatchbacks for the image obsessed.

hmmm... not sure how I should feel about myself after that comment.

I like them. My G35X with a bit more utility is pretty appealing to me."
49,2009-04-13T20:49:41+00:00,ateixeira,"The back seat in the G35 is roomier, though, at least as far as I remember.

I guess if you don't often use the back seat and it's not a priority, that may not be a big deal.

For me, though, I guess I like small/light cars, so I'd want a compact vehicle like that to be lighter and smaller."
0,2009-04-13T20:50:54+00:00,qbrozen,lighter I agree with. But most complaints are that it is already too small. go figure.

Stunning!"
3,2009-04-14T15:52:00+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw the new Jag sedan, but get this - it was FILTHY.

For shame... :sick:"
4,2009-04-17T18:13:06+00:00,qbrozen,"Well, I went to the NY auto show yesterday, so I spotted LOTS of new stuff.

short list:
* I was very disappointed that Ford felt the need to lock down more of their vehicles than Porsche. Why? Is the new Fiesta so valuable?
* Very disappointed in the XC60. First Volvo I ever met that I didn't feel comfortable in. The seats try to be SUV'ish while the floor is sedan'ish. So I'm sitting upright with my legs stretched out before me and I wind up FAR away from the windshield and controls.
* Very disappointed in the Camaro. Narrow windows and low ceiling don't mix. By the time I got comfortable, I was almost laying down and could not see the hood.
* New Taurus is too big for my taste. So even with the impressive SHO package, I don't think I'd consider it.
* EX35 - OK, not new, but my first chance to sit in one. I really liked it. I don't know what the complaints are about with the rear seat. Seemed to be just the same as my G on which it is based.
* Mazda3 - very weird grille. The overall shape of the hatch seems to be smoother than current gen. I THOUGHT I sat in one and was pretty impressed with it, till I got out and realized I sat in a 6 instead. Huh. I didn't get to sit in the 3 because my son ran to the next ""booth"" before I got the chance.
* Metallic brown seems to be this year's color. Volvo, Ford, Porsche, BMW, Infiniti, and several others all had a metallic brown car on display.

And for those counting, yes, I used ""very disappointed"" 3 times. Possibly exceeding my allocation."
5,2009-04-17T20:18:32+00:00,boomchek,Fintail and I were talking about the resurgence of brown colors too. There were plenty upscale cars with some sort of brown variant. Not too bad imo.
6,2009-04-17T22:35:32+00:00,fintail,"I think I remember a Volvo and maybe an Infiniti in a light brown, yeah.

Not really my cup of tea...has a strong mid-late malaise era connotation to me. The Ciera my mom had was kind of a bronze, which is related to brown, and the S-10 Blazer my dad was a nice medium metallic brown, which suited the vehicle perfectly if you know what I mean.... :shades:

But I guess it won't look dirty easily."
7,2009-04-18T15:30:03+00:00,boomchek,The new 7 series was in bornw too.
8,2009-04-18T16:00:53+00:00,qbrozen,"I like the brown. My wife knows it, too. The first one we saw was the S80 and she said, ""oh, look, its the color you want."" Then we went on to see a dozen other cars in a similar color and I began thinking maybe I don't want it (only for the reason that now I'm worried it will become too popular)."
9,2009-04-20T14:17:58+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I am seeing the whole ""Chocolate"" color theme in many different products, especially in the home improvment shows on television. I like it as well, very modern, very classy, yet Earthy. Heck, even the new Lowes commercial advertises the new Weber Grills which can be had in the Chocolate Brown.

I think it's a fad that will whither eventually, but for now its' a pretty cool new addition in the sea of Beige and Sand colored cars. :shades:"
10,2009-04-21T14:42:23+00:00,ateixeira,"I've even seen chocolate brown leather. Check out a Miata Special Edition, or the two-tone mocha-chocolate & cream leather on the Malibu. Love 'em both.

I went to the same car show, let's see...

I also tried the doors on the Fiesta. What gives?

The SHO was closed too, IIRC. They've been teasing us with talk of the EcoBoost and when we finally see a product it's locked up? This is a Taurus, not an Aston Martin.

I sat in the EX35 also. I may have been a bit harsh, I could actually squeeze in to that back seat. Not roomy by any means, but technically I did fit behind myself. Plus the trend seems to be small - the Tiguan, Q5, GLK, and XC60 are also not exactly roomy.

Call me practical but I'd pick a Forester XT over any of those. More space for less plus you're not giving up any performance.

The interior is not as nice, though, and I noticed that was true of a lot of the mainstream small crossovers. RAV4, CR-V, even Tiguan, you expect a VW to be nicer inside but it only had about half the upgrades I expected, maybe even less.

Mazda3 - over styled. Honestly I think Mazda hit its peak one generation ago for the 3 and the 6 as well. The new grilles on just about all the models are way overdone, from the CX9 to the CX7 and even the Miata.

Honda had base model Pilots and CR-Vs and those interior seemed lacking also. I think to leave Acura space to be better, well, they did just that, leaving room for improvement all around. Especially the Pilot.

I'll write about the Miata in a seperate post."
11,2009-04-21T15:14:42+00:00,ateixeira,"OK, I bought a 2008, which are a great deal right now, so I looked very closely at the new 2009.

They gave it the smiley faced grille that the whole lineup has. It's less bad in the Miata, because it's smaller, but I still prefer the 08's simple oval. The headlights are more cats-eye and less oval as well. Both are OK to me.

The tail lights are now red and they bulge out, which is another new trend I've noticed. I'm not sure I like it, though the rest of the back view is clean.

One change they added is models with the manual trans have plumbing from the intake straight in to the cabin to increase the amount of engine noise you hear. Personally I think that's absolutely ridiculous. My 2008 is borderline too-loud already and that might cross the line and become obnoxious. I would probably figure out a way to disconnect or insulate that.

Inside, I was looking to see if they addressed 3 comfort issues: hard left elbow rest, cup holder that rubs the left knee the wrong way, and a padded center console.

1. The left elbow rest is now padded. Amen. Problem solved.

2. The cup holder is now sunk in to the door, and no longer protrudes. Resolved.

3. Only the cover of the cup holders is padded, and it's sort of far forward. My elbows landed on hard surfaces. Nice try but no cigar.

They also made some slight revisions to the engine, so now the redline is higher, which is cool I guess. More power but only at 7000rpm.

That redline is now actually visible, too. With mine the red marks disappear almost completely at night. Not a major problem unless you are in the 24 hours of Daytona, I suppose, but they still fixed this.

The most important fix was the bottle holders in the doors, ironically, but the 2008s now have a $5000 rebate plus they cost less to begin with, so there's no way I'd choose the 2009 over a bargain 2008.

No regrets."
12,2009-04-21T17:29:39+00:00,boomchek,"I agree about the Mazda3. The new face with a ton of exposed black plastic doesn't do anything for me.

Maybe they could have put a body color strip on it, or a chrome strip or something to break up the black plastic in the front."
13,2009-04-21T18:29:43+00:00,ateixeira,I will say this - feature content was impressive. Even the interior materials were definitely a step up from competitors.
14,2009-04-21T18:33:20+00:00,qbrozen,"I was really in love with the color combo on the EX they had there.

Yes, the SHO was locked up, too. Really ridiculous.

We didn't stop at the Honda display ... which reminds me...

I forgot to mention I stopped to check out and get in the G5. Not nearly worth the money. I think it had a tag on it of about $17k. I wouldn't touch it for that price when I could get a Fit for similar money, which would be a big step up. If I wanted something so tin-can like as the G5, I could buy a Versa and save a bundle."
15,2009-04-21T18:39:13+00:00,ateixeira,"I'm so sick of seeing GM clones that I don't even look at them any more. Either model.

Chevy had their new small sedan (Cruze is it?) but it was closed."
16,2009-04-21T18:54:51+00:00,texases,"Yeah, the SHO was locked up at the Dallas show, too. That's irritating, but pretty normal for cars that aren't yet in the showrooms. I'm interested, but $40k is a bit much...

And I don't like Mazda's new corporate front, either, it's goofy looking. The 6's 'coupe' roofline is style over function."
17,2009-04-21T19:01:26+00:00,ateixeira,"I have to duck when getting in and out of the back seat, and it's HUGE. No excuse for that."
18,2009-04-22T12:22:22+00:00,guss,"I think Mazda had their niche withe the previous 6, sized between a compact and a midsize. The new 6 grew so much it is one of the larger mid sizes. Bigger goes against their sporty image."
19,2009-04-22T14:53:55+00:00,ateixeira,"I liked the outgoing wagon - it was right-sized.

The 5 door was a little cramped in the back, too close in size to the Mazda3 5 door.

I can see why they made it bigger, but the roofline almost made it more of a 4 door coupe."
20,2009-04-22T15:08:09+00:00,andys120,"Browns were popular in the late 60's and early 70s on various German cars, especially Mercedes and Porsche which were offered in nice shades of Chocolate with matching tan upholstery.

American makers picked up on this and began offering various shades of metallic brown during the 1970s but browns haven't been much in evidence since the 1970s.

I think it was the Buick Enclave that reintroduced browns to the spectrum in the last few years."
21,2009-04-22T16:52:31+00:00,lemko,...black Mercedes-Benz CL550 AMG and dark gray Acura TL.
22,2009-04-22T18:15:12+00:00,boomchek,I agree about the Enclave. I think brown is the only right color for it.
23,2009-04-22T18:44:42+00:00,ateixeira,That is a nice color...
24,2009-04-22T19:22:10+00:00,fintail,"MB had a dark brown named 'Havana Brown', but after the silliness with Cuba, it was named 'Tobacco Brown' and was seen on many models through the late 70s.

Not my first choice, although a brown on caramel 6.9 could be fun as a period piece."
25,2009-04-24T01:46:47+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Murcielago Spyder this evening, yellow-orange color...I think that's something new, or at least unusual."

27,2009-04-29T21:25:55+00:00,06stang,"I spotted two new cars today-
2009 Volkswagen CC and the new 2010 Ford Fusion. Both were black and both were stunning cars- especially out on the road driving around."
28,2009-05-01T17:51:17+00:00,lemko,...a black and red Smart at the Lowe's last night. I think he was there to pick up 14 sheets of drywall! :P
29,2009-05-03T22:26:21+00:00,fintail,"Saw a black Genesis today...have still seen only a few of these. They are going to be a secondhand steal, I think. I still have issues with laying down 40K for any car, and the swoopy H doesn't help."
30,2009-05-03T23:08:13+00:00,scscars,LMAO!!
31,2009-05-04T19:13:28+00:00,fintail,Saw a Q5 and a GLK within about 5 minutes of each other today...looks like the small/kinda pointless and kinda pricey crossover segment is alive and well.
32,2009-05-05T17:28:52+00:00,boomchek,"I see a ton of GLKs around here. At least 4-5 per day. Also some of the new Tiguans, but no Q5s."
33,2009-05-05T19:10:47+00:00,fintail,"Van is still a big MB town for sure.

I think I have only seen one or two Tiguans. I have seen a few of the XC60 too.

Also several new style RX, but those are pretty forgettable."
34,2009-05-05T20:12:38+00:00,boomchek,"I've seen a couple XC60s as well.

The new RXs are very common here. We have a large population of Asians from Hong Kong here, with a lot of money, and they seem to buy up the newest and best cars on the market. Hence I see a ton of Benzes, Bimmers, and Lexi (Lexuses ?)."
35,2009-05-05T20:53:00+00:00,fintail,"I remember back in the 90s it seemed every third car in Van was a MB W140, that was when the HK influx was at its peak. Must be good work being a highline salesman there."
36,2009-05-05T21:08:45+00:00,boomchek,You also gotta speak the language.
37,2009-05-05T22:11:28+00:00,fintail,"Just a minor detail

It'd be even better to own a highline dealer there...probably good volume for about 20 years now, and the somewhat secretive nature of the money seems to be resistant to the great recession."
38,2009-05-06T17:50:09+00:00,guss,in black. Kinda reminds me of the first generation CR-V for some reason. Kia made the boxy hatch look cool.
39,2009-05-06T18:34:32+00:00,lemko,...white Nissan Maxima. These are kind of rare compared to Altimas.
40,2009-05-06T19:02:42+00:00,lmp180psu,"Kia Soul...very interesting compared to the boring and just ugly new xB I also saw today

Ford Flex in a maroon color. I have seen 2 of them, and both were maroon."
41,2009-05-06T19:35:07+00:00,fintail,I've seen ads plastered on the tube for $299 leases on Maximas. They must have a shipping terminal full of them somewhere.
42,2009-05-06T19:46:26+00:00,texases,"There used to be a clear reason to go with the Maxima over the Altima-not any more. I see very few here, too."
43,2009-05-07T14:14:13+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a new Maxima the other day, also.

The Volvo dealer on Route 50 in MD had a bunch of XC60s but I still don't think I've seen one on the road.

Saw it at the auto show - very stylish. Doesn't seem as small as the Q5 either."
44,2009-05-12T12:24:29+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I didn't think they were for sale yet?

I couldn't tell if it was a GT or not since it was heading the opposite direction on the highway this morning, but it was black and it looked, um, well,

meh.

It's gonna take some time getting used to the new look."
45,2009-05-14T20:32:58+00:00,ateixeira,"Dealer car?

Production started last week or so, but I doubt any have been delivered to customers already."
46,2009-05-14T20:34:48+00:00,ateixeira,"Finally saw one out on the roads. Very sharp looking, perhaps the looker of the upscale small crossover segment."
47,2009-05-15T01:52:30+00:00,fintail,"Two ends of the automotive spectrum on my street this evening, within 5 minutes of each other.

First, a Zap Xebra drives by - the heinous looking three wheeled electric beast that is probably a good prediction of what cars will look like once the scourge known as globalization infects motoring and dumbs it down like it does to everything else.

Then 5 minutes later, a new unplated Maserati Quattroporte with a delicious exhaust note."
48,2009-05-15T14:54:21+00:00,ateixeira,"Not hardly new, but I was surprised to see one of these awful cars still running at all.

I remember these had the worst depreciation in the industry, worth something like 22% of the new value after 5 years. The best cars held 55% of their value."
49,2009-05-17T01:25:50+00:00,fintail,"I saw a new style Z4 today, I don't recall seeing one yet."
0,2009-05-17T15:45:17+00:00,bumpy,"looks like a cross between a Veracruz and a Rondo, with taillights from those Volvo XC wagons. Does not resemble an Elantra in any meaningful way."
1,2009-05-17T20:42:38+00:00,ghulet,"....today at the grocery store; kind of resembles a 7/8 scale xB, but it's uglier. It also, due to its narrow stance and smallish greenhouse, doesn't look like it has too much room, either."
2,2009-05-18T12:45:06+00:00,anythngbutgm,"3 new Challengers, 2 Red R/T models and a smokin hot Black SRT.

Also a ton of Venza's, new Pilot's, a few GLK's, new model Accord's in every color and trim level out there and a few new Lexus RX's. Even cooler than any of these was a Porsche festival that was in the area and seeing a dozen or so old 356 Speedsters wizzing by."
3,2009-05-18T18:31:47+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw a gorgeous yellow 356, I'll guess about 1964 or so, on a trailer on I-270 in MD. Last night so he must have been coming back from the same event."

It really looks like a cartoon car... Without the big star on the grill, it could be the Kia Soul's big brother....

A poor showing by Mercedes.. I like the look of most of their cars, but this one and the R-Class... what were they thinking?"
6,2009-05-19T15:28:50+00:00,ateixeira,"I couldn't agree more.

And the new ML looks so good, too. They should have just done a mini-ML.

The GLK looks stubby, too upright and maybe even a bit dorky.

The R class is avoid and not as well executed as Benz' own B-class.

I pretty much like the whole lineup minus the R and GLK."
7,2009-05-19T16:09:46+00:00,anythngbutgm,My wife and I both agree the GLK looks like the last gen Forester. I think it's the big wheels that throw off the whole profile.
8,2009-05-19T16:14:20+00:00,ateixeira,"You think?

I owned one of those, I guess the tall greenhouse has a bit of resemblance.

The GLK is fat on the bottom half, though, while the old Forester was low and more sleek. The GLK has that bulldog look to it."

11,2009-05-19T18:53:29+00:00,lemko,"Amazing! How can you distinguish them from Pruises without seeing the ""H?"""
12,2009-05-19T19:05:34+00:00,fintail,"The rear quarter treatment is different. They are less dorky than a Prius, but attracting the same basic customer no doubt."

14,2009-05-19T19:45:37+00:00,andys120,"They are less dorky than a Prius, but attracting the same basic customer no doubt.

I doubt it. The Prius appeals to a crowd that wants to proclaim ""Look at me, I""m getting better mileage than you, saving the environment etc.""

The first Insight with it's even more outre styling said the same thing but was too small to be successful. This new Insight looks like it could be a Civic hatch. I think it'll be a huge success for Honda."
15,2009-05-19T19:49:28+00:00,lemko,"Wow, if only the dorky clothes Mom bought for me from the 1973 Sears and Roebuck catalog could still fit, I could be GEEK CHIC!!! Hey, where did that wallet inspector go? :confuse:"
16,2009-05-19T20:25:26+00:00,bhill2,"Actually, I don't think they are after the same customers. The Prius is larger, better fitted, and more expensive. I think the Insight targets a younger and/or less affluent customer than the Prius, although they will both tend to be tree huggers. Oh by the way, the Prius is also more efficient and gets better mileage than the Insight. One of the reasons that it is more expensive."
17,2009-05-19T21:07:10+00:00,fintail,"I agree with that much, the Insight will be a hit. I might actually even prefer it if I had to choose between it and its counterpart. I bet it drives better, anyway.

But I see both going to the enviro-chic types."
18,2009-05-19T21:08:11+00:00,fintail,"Other than gas mileage, how is the Prius more efficient? More efficient use of profit margins? :P"

22,2009-05-20T14:05:42+00:00,ateixeira,"Insight costs more than early forecasts thought. Edmunds had one article where the estimated starting price was $18 grand.

Turns out with freight it starts at close to $21 grand. :surprise:

And it is smaller than the Prius, plus Toyota has a base 2010 Prius with a price very nearly the same as the base Insight.

Honda missed an opportunity, IMHO. Either that or Toyota got smart and de-contented the base Prius to remain competitive. The starting prices are only about a grand apart IIRC."
23,2009-05-20T14:08:28+00:00,ateixeira,"First a black Challenger SRT8. Very nice, lots of presence.

It was right next to a new BMW 328i sedan and I swear the BMW was completely invisible. The Challenger is so much wider, grabs so much more attention.

I liked the car on the show stands but out on the street it stands out even more, and it's not even my type of car.

Another unique car, and get this: a one-off, custom Cadillac Deville 4 door....convertible! :shades:

I wonder about the structure for that hack job but it looked GREAT. Total flashback to the big convertible barges of the 60s and 70s. I thought it was so cool."

The styling is odd to me - somehow it gives me a strong sense of large Honda DNA. The front is very odd to me as there's really no front bumper, the grille drops right off. I guess that's the trend. I could live with the styling, but it doesn't seem either revolutionary or evolutionary to me. It's just kind of there. Inoffensive. I do appreciate the heritage-themed accent line above the rear wheel opening, which is influenced by pontons and fintails.

The interior was excellent - quality of materials and fit and finish seemed top notch. This car should be on a success, as it improves some of the iffy interior quality seen in W211 cars.

Here's a couple phone pics I took:"
44,2009-05-26T14:16:30+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a couple of those at the beach this weekend, Ocean City, MD. They don't look nearly as good as the outgoing ""retro 1967"" models.

Also saw a Kia Soul, all white, this morning. Those things are TALL. Nearly as tall as the new MDX in front it."
45,2009-05-26T14:22:58+00:00,ateixeira,"Exterior styling peaked with the previous model, which was timeless and looked good the day it came out.

I agree the front bumper (or lack thereof) is a bit odd, but it's probably due to pedestrian crash standards in Europe.

Overall is looks like it was inspired by the little C-class, but somehow didn't turn out as elegant, and it should be more elegant, not less."
46,2009-05-26T17:20:02+00:00,fintail,"The W210 and W211 have aged pretty well, and are the basic design most people seem to associate with MB today. This new design, with the 'edgy' theme being embraced by lemminglike designers everywhere, is not timeless, and could look dated with the next fad emerges. The W211 was an evolutionary step from the W210 - this one abandons that old path.

I guess the lack of a bumper doesn't matter when it is often the same piece as the fascia anyway. If you damage it, it is replaced whether or not it protrudes an inch."

The previous E 'bumper' was a very small extension on the front end...maybe it doesn't make a difference...but its a new look for MB. The C and S have just a tiny bit more of a hint of a traditional bumper shape."

I guess BMW is making room for the smaller roadster, Z2 IIRC?

I remember a while ago the Miata was 400-500 lbs lighter than the Z4, now the difference is something like 900 lbs! :surprise:

As for the Cube---ick. Actually, the front is fine, I kinda like the unique window shapes and configuration, but the rear end looks like a cross between one of those mid-size GM wagons (74-77 Malibu) or an old Infiniti J30, either way with a camper top graphed on."
17,2009-06-05T11:34:36+00:00,andys120,"They've grown so big, though.

I guess BMW is making room for the smaller roadster, Z2 IIRC

Size wise it is perhaps half a size larger than the original Z4/E85 so it's not really very big but unfortunately it is fairly heavy, some of which is attributable to thew folding top.

There certainly is room for a smaller Z2, just as the ""big"" Healey 100/3000 left plenty of room for a basic 4 cylinder Sprite. Rumors of a Z2 persist but are regularly knocked down. It will probably depend on the state of the world economy.

There are also substantial rumors of a smaller Porsche $40K roadster based on a chassis to be shared w VW and Audi (R4?). See the new issue of CAR for some very interesting speculation."

20,2009-06-08T15:22:51+00:00,ateixeira,"Drove through the auto park yesterday, everything was closed (sign of the times?) but we were able to check out a bunch of new cars.

Saw another 09 Miata in that Sunburst Yellow color. Beautiful, but why didn't they make it available in the hard top models?

Then we saw a new Cube, 5 of them actually. Prices were $16-24k, with a $2000 dealer markup (good luck with that). Nice rims on the high-end ones, but at those prices you're competing with far more substantial vehicles. Didn't like the drum brakes or the black plastic trim on the D-pillar of the driver's side.

Also saw the new BMW Z4, it must have the longest hood in the industry. At least proportionally. Feels like a giant hood with a small passenger cabin tacked on to the back of it.

It has definitely grown bigger, more of a GT now than a sports car, must dwarf the old Z3. This one was silver, with a red leather interior that was to die for. 3 metal ringed dials at the center of the dash actually wake up the usually dull BMW interior. They seemed to have moved it up to compete half way between the SLK and the SL.

Took yet another look at the 1 series convertible - again concluded the back seat is a +2 at best, and that's being generous. Sticker shock, too, when I saw a $41,000 price tag for a 128i, the base model. Seriously?

That's about it. Had the dealers been open I would have checked out a few more cars."

So what was it? Blown engine? Blown head gasket? i know they have some big problems with camshafts breaking but wouldn't that render the vehicle undrivable? Any of these?

ghulet: to feed your flame even more, a 2008 Miata with a $5000 rebate is now actually the cheaper 2 seater option, and 0-60 comes in less than HALF the time, really (14.4s for the ForTwo with Premium fuel BTW vs. 6.9s for the MX-5 per C&D)."

Ya know ... and not that this reflects where you live, but just brings something to mind ... I am sometimes baffled by where I see cars parked sometimes. For instance, there is this tiny bungalow on a major road in my town with a Hummer in the driveway. In my old neighborhood of Cape Cods on postage stamp lots, there was one house with a Jag and BMW in the driveway. The list goes on."
46,2009-06-17T19:36:37+00:00,fintail,"I know exactly what you mean. In my area, where housing prices really inflated before the bubble burst, it wasn't uncommon to see a high end MB or BMW parked at a pretty dumpy place - of course the place was still worth 500K+. The key is ""was""...parking a new CLS or 6er in front of that unrenovated concrete block bungalow seemed normal for a while.

In my building someone else drives a current model Lexus LS, which also seems a bit fancy for the place. I'm trying to think of the worst cars there...a few of the really neglected ones (old Accent that was never washed, leaky filthy early 90s Legend) moved recently...someone drives a ca. 1993 Camry that appears to have survived a Taliban battle, someone else has a dodgy sounding 80s Jeep...those might be it."
47,2009-06-17T19:51:34+00:00,qbrozen,"Come to think of it ... something else strikes me as a bit odd. Down the street from me at the McMansion part of the neighborhood, there are several houses with cars like Cavaliers, 20-year-old BMWs, Civics, etc. So the guy with the bungalow has a Hummer and the guy with the 5-bedrooms and 3-car-garage on an acre of manicured lawn has a mazda3. I guess its all about priorities."
48,2009-06-18T03:27:06+00:00,fintail,"Reminds me of a house I see in a nice low traffic area I take my old car cruising in when I have it out - a nice house, still worth nearly 2M even in this market, always has the same three cars side by side in the driveway (as with most people lucky enough to have a 3 car garage, theirs is full of no doubt worthless junk and the cars get to sleep outside). The cars are a pair of ca. 1995 LS400s and a ca. 1990 300E."
49,2009-06-18T11:26:58+00:00,ghulet,"....I live in a very un-fancy part of the city of Chicago (Humboldt Park); most of the cars (parked on the street anyway) tend to be early-to-mid '90s smaller Japanese cars (a first-gen Protege, plenty of Civics, Accords, Camrys, even a very early Kia Sephia), with lots of cheapo domestics thrown in (think 99-ish Malibu); the homeowners generally have nicer cars (one neighbor has a LR Discovery, one a Saab 9-5 Aero, one a new Altima) but nothing super-glamorous. A newer Benz or BMW would stick out like a sore thumb around here.

We also have the distinction of having one of the highest rates of depreciation in housing stock in the last year (we bought in 2006, naturally--this was supposed to be the next hot neighborhood). Look like we'll be here a while, barring a job loss and/or short sale! :P"

Also rented a new Accord with a 4 cylinder. What a disappointment. Very noisy on the road and rough riding. Got 30 mpg highway, not much better than the 28 I get with my smoother, more powerful ES300. Good rear seat room, at least."

Middle manager gets laid off, and he keeps his house, but no new cars for a while. Hence the 19 year old Benz.

Could also just be happy with the cars and not feel the need for a new one. I bet a 95 LS is still pretty decent if it was well taken care of. Same for the 90 Benz."

3,2009-06-18T19:50:27+00:00,fintail,"I was thinking the same thing...the house is probably from the late 80s, so if it was bought by an affluent person when new (under 500K then without a doubt), their peak earning years likely have passed, and they are now a little more conservative with their money. The place also has a property tax bill well north of 10K, that can eat into car money too.

Those cars are both good examples of models from prestige badges that are easy to live with, so it might just be sensible too."

I actually like low-slung sedans like the CLS and Passat CC, I can see the point at least, even though I'd just get the E class or regular Passat for the extra head room. But at least they're more attractive outside.

Not so with the X6. It looks like a gigantic hatchback. Sedans and SUVs are simply more attractive. The raked rear window kills cargo space and end up looking...awkward, like you said."

I think dumb styling cues (like aggressive headlights) ar an admission that designers can't do anything else.

The tank-window look is about safety...not actual safety, but the feeling of safety and isolation. I think the sheeple value that in these times. Even MB, which has a history of tall-windowed cars, has shortened them up a bit."

I actually measured the rear window on the soft and hard top Miatas to see which offered better visibility. The hard top does - mostly because the glass is closer to your eyes."

It seems, especially in these troubled days, the masses do want isolation - most of the popular small SUVs that somehow make their drivers feel safe aren't vehicles with the most glass area, either. People want to feel like they are in a room...and their driving often reflects it."
6,2009-06-26T03:13:21+00:00,fintail,"I agree with the rear end - it is VERY Asian derivative. It reminds me of the Lexus IS, myself.

Lexus used to copy MB pretty much line for line...now something has reversed. Hopefully this new E can have some Asian reliability to match its rear styling. I'm taking a trip to Germany this fall and have already booked a new style E (350CDi) as a rental...hopefully that's what I get, unless they want to upgrade me."

9,2009-06-27T15:29:42+00:00,fintail,"I attended my local MB dealer's new E-class preview hoopla yesterday evening. They had 3 E350 coupes, 3 E350 sedans, and an E550. The coupes are interesting - like a mini CL in a way, but with an odd soft pillar in the rear side window. Pano roof is standard on the coupes, which is cool. The coupes I saw had somewhat odd bucket seats that reminded me of the high back one-piece units from 70s domestic cars. The odd edgy detailing and fakey Japanese rear ends will take some getting used to. I did notice that on one sedan, where there is no real front bumper and it simply ends at a peak or a ""beak"", there was already a scratch on the frontmost pat - I suspect this part of the car will take abuse from bad parkers.

Fit and finish on the cars was pretty much flawless, and the paintwork on the cars was perfect - of course the cars were screened before being shown, no doubt."
10,2009-06-27T16:12:04+00:00,boomchek,"The front beak of the bumper - wouldn't the front license plate holder go there anyways, at least in the states that require front plates?

I can see how that part can wear out first though.

Fast forward 10 years and most of these E classes will have a ""usual"" front bumper beak chipped off.

I notoiced that soft pillar in the rear side windows too. I guess the window was too wide to roll down without hitting the wheel well area so they had to shorten it with the pillars."
11,2009-06-27T19:00:24+00:00,fintail,"Good point about the license plate - none of the cars were registered or even had front plate holders, so that didn't cross my mind. Hopefully they will mount in a way to protect the beak. For the people who live in no front plate states...be careful. This will be a problem area. For a car with a couple hundred miles on it to already have mark there doesn't bode well.

Oh, this is what struck me the most - the grille doesn't go up with the hood when the hood is raised. This is the first MB with a prominent sedan style grille that operates that way, IIRC. I can't say I like this change from tradition. Having the grille raise with the hood enables me to have access to the area around the radiator, and gives me something to hit my head on.

Something else that is odd are the fog lights. You either get bizarre twin lights on each side, or on a higher model, weird looking trendy LEDs.

I think the mini-CL coupe should be a success...it looks like a car costing twice as much, and the pano roof will help sell it no doubt. It also costs no more than the sedan."
12,2009-06-29T15:58:13+00:00,anythngbutgm,Another new Subaru Legacy in Black and a new Ford Fiesta! It was green and had sme lettering down the side which led me to believe it was a promo car. I couldn't read it though becasue it was zipping by the other direction but it looked fantastic!

But, that face!! :surprise:"
17,2009-06-30T14:48:27+00:00,ateixeira,"Mazda overdid the styling. I didn't even like the concepts (Nagaro) that inspired them, and I feared this would happen.

The Mazda3 is by far the most radical ""face"", and I still can't get used to it, even after seeing many of them. I have a Miata so I've been to Mazda dealers a lot recently, including for accessory purchases.

The Mazda6 is also overdone.

The rest of the lineup is OK, but I still think every predecessor looks better than the current car, and that's for the entire lineup, even the 2009 Miata doesn't look at good as my 2008."
18,2009-06-30T18:15:35+00:00,fintail,"I have seen several of the new 3 already - I have to believe there is actually a demographic that wants something with a cutesy/goofy/stupid face like that. I won't go into details, but I do think there are groups who are attracted to that, and don't mind the overdone detailing either. This is not a society built on good taste :shades:

The 6 to me seems big and bland more than anything else. The original was relatively subtle and restrained, a very clean and homogeneous design that seemed elegant, especially when the design was brand new. The new one...it's just kind of there. I've heard a lot of them are going to fleets."

The Nissan/Suzuki/Kia/GMC dealer had about 3 salespeople way at the Kia end of the lot a half block away. Otherwise the lot and showroom were empty. We would have liked to have looked inside the Cube and taken the SX4 out for a spin.

My wife ran into a couple she knows at the dealer and they are shopping similar small cars - Fit, Soul, etc. The woman made an insightful comment that every one of them had some little something missing. The problem with the SX4 is the mpg, although you can turn the AWD off, but you still have too short of a range between fill-ups.

We also drove an xD again and my wife, who shattered her left leg skiing back in February (rod, 9 screws), was happy to see she could use the clutch in the manual transmission one we drove."

40,2009-07-14T20:26:34+00:00,lokki,"The guy with the (reserved) parking spot next to mine has a new silver Camaro RS. ( I have actually never met the guy - he comes in before I do, and leaves before I do.)

I like the looks of the Camaro very much in the sheetmetal, but don't like them either. Every line is very good, but somehow the thing doesn't work overall.

I've been musing all day about it, and I think I've finally put my finger on the problem.

It looks as if someone took a high-pressure air hose to a 1969 Camaro and over-inflated it. The lines are all the same but the car is bigger, and every line is exaggerated - the car is a caricature of itself.





I still like it, and it really seems beautifully done. The leather in the interior, seems to be very good quality. Overall, great car.... but it's a HotWheels Camaro."
41,2009-07-14T20:45:10+00:00,texases,"Good comments on the Camaro, Lokki - you figured out what I was trying to...just something doesn't look right to me on the new one - overdone, exaggerated. Particularly with both pics. I like that red one better than any Mustang, Firebird, Barracuda, or Challenger, new or old."
42,2009-07-14T21:13:50+00:00,ajvdh,"It's like the designers tried just a little too hard. IMHO, the new Challenger is a better retro effort.

We were up in Yellowstone over the weekend of the 4th. It looked like Ford had a stranglehold on the rental market: There were tons of new 'Stangs and Flexes. While I'm sure the Flex is practical as all get-out, it's not real pretty. Imposing, maybe, but not in a good way.

Back in my 'hood, the guy who owns the gray Ford GT has been exercising it pretty regularly. I also saw a gray IS-F running around."
43,2009-07-15T12:05:48+00:00,anythngbutgm,"LOL, I'm sure he's been there himself. This guys idea of a test drive is to take it on the highway up to tripple digits and back down again at the next off ramp. He lives and breaths Benzos. He also has a CLS and before that an E500."

4,2009-07-17T18:04:59+00:00,fintail,"Maybe not brand new, but I saw an E63 wagon the other day. Yes, please."
5,2009-07-17T18:54:27+00:00,boomchek,That's gotta be a rarity.
6,2009-07-17T19:16:15+00:00,anythngbutgm,That and the RS6 have got to be the ultimate sleepers in my books... Top gear did a great comparo and the E63 was just ridiculous :shades:
7,2009-07-17T20:03:55+00:00,fintail,W211 E55 wagons came over at a rate of about 100 per year...I'd bet the E63 is even rarer.
8,2009-07-17T20:04:36+00:00,fintail,"I think I remember that comparo.

The performance figures are also virtually identical to the CLK63 Black Series - in a wagon!"
9,2009-07-18T01:39:56+00:00,british_rover,"I think the M5 Touring was in that comparo too.

Not on the same level of performance but I have always found the V70R a lot more fun to drive."
10,2009-07-18T01:47:08+00:00,fintail,"A V70R has to be a pretty rare bird, too."
11,2009-07-18T01:55:55+00:00,british_rover,"Probably not as rare as the E55 wagon and definitely not as rare as the E63.

We end up selling four to six V70Rs a year on average sometimes more. I think we are on number four so far this year. Usually only get two with manuals though."
12,2009-07-18T03:01:10+00:00,fintail,"I don't know if I have ever seen a V70R on the road. I have seen a few S60R. There is something to be said for exclusivity, especially if it is subtle.

I have seen 2 E55 wagons, and the E63 I saw was my first sighting in the wild."
13,2009-07-18T11:35:44+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I'm a big fan of the V70R, especially with the manual. Now that Subie doesn't offer the Outback X/T nor the Legacy GT wagon , it would be nice to see Volvo offer the R-spec wagons with the next iteration of the V-series."
14,2009-07-19T21:35:39+00:00,stever,"Guess they don't really count since we went to a dealer and test drove an Elantra Touring.

They had several Genesis sedans and a few coupes too, including one in a semi-bright green that was very attractive and sporty looking. The salesperson said that yellow cars were the worst for getting speeding tickets but that the bright green one was sure to attract its share. Maybe I'll be able to recognize them in the wild now at least.

The Elantra Touring wagon we drove was bright bright red and a bit much for us. The blue was bright too, but at least it matches Boise State blue. Nice ride but they're about two grand too high at this dealer."
15,2009-07-19T22:02:47+00:00,british_rover,"The current V70 is a bit too big to make a good V70R the way the old one was.

I guess the current gen V70 with the new 280ish T6 engine and a bigger turbo with more boost would make a great high speed tourer. The new V70 is just way too big to be a tossable car like the old V70R was. Either that or the 311 hp V8 from the S80 maybe with a single turbo would be hot too.

EDIT:

I saw an Elantra Touring today as well. I actually kind of liked it."
16,2009-07-19T22:26:55+00:00,stever,"Wagons are the new crossovers, lol. I think we still are going to sacrifice some space and comfort and get a hatch, but you never know. We may just sit on our hands another six or eight months."

It most reminds me of a Matrix but the Matrix/Vibe are not quite so wagonny looking.

I finally realized what bell and whistle was missing - they don't offer factory navigation. That's fine with me - they have a little flip up box on top of the dash that looks fine for sticking a portable nav in, although there's no power in the box.

The heated/cooled glove box was a bit of a ""huh?"" too."

28,2009-08-04T19:25:23+00:00,ajvdh,"Open track on Sunday, the largest single contingent was a group of 7 or 8 new Camaros. I'm pretty sure they were all V8s. Most of them went out on the track, but typically for only a couple of laps at a time. A couple of them did show some interest in learning the line. The one who was trying the hardest had his brakes go completely south.

The majority were good about checking mirrors and pointing by, but one guy needed a little attitude adjustment. A dive-bomb pass is a good way of disabusing someone of the notion that being fast down the straight is the same thing as running a quick lap."
29,2009-08-04T19:40:04+00:00,xhe518,"V8 Camaros have Brembo brakes, so maybe those were V6s"
30,2009-08-04T19:41:33+00:00,xhe518,Saw one on the road with manufacturer's plates. Looked nice!
31,2009-08-04T20:27:19+00:00,ajvdh,"Nope, It was an SS. Even said ""Brembo"" on the calipers. Doesn't matter who makes the brakes, they're still bound by laws of physics. You need big, honkin' rotors and lots of cooling to dissipate the heat generated by slowing a 3900 lb/426 HP car lap after lap.

In fairness, he almost certainly had street pads on, and swapping to track pads and proper brake fluid can make a big difference. It usually takes more than a few track days to get to the point where those are required - I don't know how much experience this guy had."

I'm sure it's got gobs of room inside and plenty of functionality but the stylists went overboard IMO.

And I am one who really likes the Honda Element..."
38,2009-08-06T14:11:40+00:00,british_rover,I think a 320d would sell well here. With VW nearly completely sold out of TDIs till the 2010s get here maybe that will help convince BMW to bring some of the cheaper more fuel efficient Diesels here.
39,2009-08-06T14:23:23+00:00,fintail,"I wonder how they would price it...seeing as a loaded 335d flies past 50K, and the 1ers sell for barely less than 3ers...

MB has a huge range of diesel engines in Europe too. E220/E250/E350 and C200/220/250/350 is quite a lineup, not to mention the other cars."
40,2009-08-06T14:57:07+00:00,ateixeira,"Base wheels are small, but that's probably intentional, so they can sell the big wheel package for a hefty profit.

Think about this - the Versa starts under $10 grand. A loaded up Cube, over $20 grand. That's a lot of fluff (and profit)."

I also saw a Toyota Prius Hybrid sedan while in California last week but couldn't get close enough to see what kind of glue the owner had used to move the badges around. Either that or I missed a good opportunity to pull a Brenda Priddy and get a spy shot. :shades:"

I'm still not a fan of the exterior (My wife likes it alot)... The profile is awkward, the tail end is too blunt and Sebring-ish and the pulled back headlights dominate the front profile.

But, step inside and my opinion changed dramatically. It is very well done. The seats are excellent, the visibility is good, the rear seat is commodious, the materials and build quality was top notch. Really dig the new layout. My only gripes were the uncovered cupholders and the notchy gerabox. I didn't drive it unfortunately, but I plan to.

I am also warming up to the new Outback as well. Still ticked that they got rid of the large sunroof and the X/T model."

I also saw a new Challenger from behind, probably the angle from which it most resembles the '69-'70. Not bad but too damn big for a Pony car."
1,2009-08-16T20:27:41+00:00,fintail,"This weekend I have seen 2 new Camaros, a new Fusion (delivering pizzas no less), several new Prius, a couple new Insights, and a trophy wife in a new Quattroporte who apparently stalled it when pulling out of a driveway."
2,2009-08-17T00:03:45+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw a Legacy 2.5i, with paddle shifters and that new CVT. 31 mpg highway, yowsah. Not bad. Our Forester gets 5 fewer mpg with the same engine.

Also liked the interior, though I like the exterior more than you did. Reminds me of the G37, in a good way.

I don't like the Outback's styling as much as the Legacy sedan. It's more 5 door hatchback now, less wagon, and I think it would be more practical if the rear glass was more vertical.

A loaded up Outback 3.6R Limited was $34k, which is entirely too close to the price of the Genesis 3.8 sedan with tech package ($36k) that was sitting right next to it (the dealer sells Subarus and Hyundais in the same bldg).

Sure, it's a Hyundai, but I'm impressed every time I sit in one, and that was probably the 4th time. My wife sat in it and said ""Wow AJ"", and couldn't hardly believe it was a Hyundai.

So color me impressed with the low $20s Legacy, but at $34 grand I'd like to see thicker carpets, fabric wrapped A-pillars, and more padding in the dash plastics (the Hyundai had all that plus real leather on the dash).

Basically you get a lot more value at the starting prices, IMHO."

This one is customized a bit:"
15,2009-08-19T20:36:08+00:00,stever,"Well, the inside on the Soul we looked at was so disappointing we didn't bother to try to find anyone to let us test drive it. Didn't think we could live with the materials after comparing with similarly priced cars (xD, Fit, etc.).

And I'm a snowboarder. :shades:"

Someone please holler when they spot a 2010 xD in the wild. Or even on a transport truck."
18,2009-08-20T02:20:09+00:00,fintail,"I saw a new Impreza wagon/hatch whatever today, as a co-worker bought one. Blue, moderately equipped, nice enough little car.

Not brand new, but I also saw a fairly recent (2002+) 7er that was smoking like a chimney - kind of a mix of black and blue smoke, an unpleasant grey. I bet that's going to be expensive."
19,2009-08-20T14:31:41+00:00,ateixeira,"They're a good value for the price. You can get an Outback Sport, for instance, for mid/high teens money, and it's got heated seats and a roof rack for your bikes or kayak.

A loaded Fit, Cube, or Soul cost more and all are far less substantial."
20,2009-08-20T14:36:08+00:00,fintail,"The one I saw stickered at just over 20...but it is a ""premium"" model with deluxe wheels, roof, and a few accessories. Still not too bad, I sat in it and it seemed put together very well, although the plastics were a little hard."
21,2009-08-20T14:39:13+00:00,ateixeira,"$19,428 for the only one currently in stock at Fitzmall. That's not sticker, though, it's the no-haggle price. I've seen Cubes for more than that.

Thing is, Cube is trendy and cool, but let's face it, it's based on the $9995 Versa platform. Paying more than double for the trendy look is a bit much IMHO."
22,2009-08-20T14:42:57+00:00,fintail,"I'd much rather have the Subaru over a Cube. The 5 door isn't too hard on the eyes, it has interesting engineering, and should hold its value, at least in my area.

Trendy gets old fast. PT Cruiser and xB come to mind."
23,2009-08-20T14:45:32+00:00,ateixeira,"I think it's OK to buy those as long as you don't pay too much.

Remember when the PT Cruiser came out, some dork paid $25k for one on E-bay?

What is that car worth now? What's the scrap value for that much metal?"

Canadian dealers were selling their allotments to the US, as the demand was so huge and the greenback was stronger then.

Still get around 30 mpg on the highway with a stick and it holds a fair amount.

Drives kind of piggish though. Imagine how could it would have been if they had bothered to update it."
29,2009-08-20T16:33:48+00:00,ateixeira,"Well, 2.5l plus AWD.

Subaru needs to put the Legacy's CVT in there, that gets 31 mpg highway. It would be competitive even with AWD.

I also think Subaru should offer a 2.0l entry-level Impreza, but I won't hold my breath."
30,2009-08-20T16:40:16+00:00,stever,"That's good to hear - I didn't think any Subies were rated for over 30 highway. (Not counting the Justy of course.)

I've hit 30 a few times on the highway on my '97 Outback but it was mostly the high 20's on my road trip a few weeks ago over to the coast. I did hit a couple of roads that I didn't see any Prius's on too though."
31,2009-08-20T16:46:36+00:00,ateixeira,"We can squeeze out 30mpg out of our Forester, but you gotta keep speeds down.

Think about it, though - their entry level engine is a 2.5l. That's big!"

I usually like sitting well off the floor as that is how rover seats are but in the PT cruiser it just felt weird. My arms are short too so it is a long reach down to the shifter."

He did not hit hard enough to total it, but hard enough that I would not want it back."

Yakima just says ""we cannot fit your vehicle with a top of car rack system but you can always have one custom installed.""

I assume Thule is using some spreader setup - those always seemed to be a bit of a kludge solution to me."

22,2009-09-11T16:14:12+00:00,british_rover,Well you have a ton of new money around your area right? New money wants flashy stuff and at least in my experience is even more concerned about brand snobery then older money.
23,2009-09-11T16:41:02+00:00,fintail,"There's a mixture of new money and some slightly older money - which means Bentley Continentals probably outnumber Genesis by 10:1, but then again, so do Lexus ES/LS of the same year."

so, stopped at the dealer yesterday for a test sit. Nice. Seats were pretty comfy, and the back seat was relatively huge compared to the old one. Looked OK too, but I liked the legacy sedan they had out front even more.

Oh, the outback even had the 6 speed stick! try to find that on another SUV/CUV thingee."
25,2009-09-11T18:33:22+00:00,boomchek,"I'm still having a hard time getting used to the new Legacy's headlights. They look very Sebringish.

I think the previous generation Legacy had some of the most handsome lines of any Japanese sedan."

Surprise - the new Outback is a tad shorter than the 05-09. It's much taller and a bit wider, though, so it does look bigger overall."
27,2009-09-11T19:24:12+00:00,boomchek,I see a bit of Infinit influence in the C pillar now that you mention it.
28,2009-09-11T19:29:55+00:00,ateixeira,"Naaah, really?

The straked hood is what stands out on the Sebring. Plus the headlights fall down in to the bumper. It looks sort of blocky, heavy.

The Legacy has headlights that look pulled back, almost stacked, Nissan/Infiniti style. Look at the bumper, the big fender flares.

I don't see it at all.

I see this:



Minus the trick photography."

If you ask me Nissan ought to liberate the side of their design department that comes up with funky designs like the Figaro, S-Cargo and Cube, they're a lot more interesting than most of their regular stuff.

The new Maxima looks good though."

One cool thing though...the RRs were part of a fleet brought by RR itself - and they had several PR/demonstrator people with them. After I insulted a British guy by calling a Phantom a ""hybrid"" car (A British-German hybrid that is...when I said it he wouldn't look at me from there after), my friend asked the nice looking woman if he could sit in the Cabrio. She said yes, and he just about died. Then she asked him if he wanted to drive it! :surprise: - he didn't take her up on that though, he knew he'd be scared to drive something so expensive, especially on the crowded roads here."
40,2009-09-14T17:25:54+00:00,boomchek,"lol. People forget that hybrid does not necessarily mean gas-electric. It just means a combination fo two different parts. Back during the height of import tuning (mid to late 90s) Hondas with engines swaps from Acuras or other Hondas were called hybrids too.

Snooty Brit. You should have asked him for some Grey Poupon. :P"

43,2009-09-14T17:39:30+00:00,boomchek,"I like all of those models. Beautifully styld bodies with reliable V8 muscle.

I once even met someone who thought the Smart car was a hybrid. I said it's a diesel, and just because it's samlla nd fuel efficient, it doesn't mean it's a hybrid."

I have to wonder if there is a certain designer or team at GM who gets to add their own touch to things. The company still has too many heavy handed designs. And that makes me think of the Volt, which has too many shades of the 1990 Lumina in it. Do these bastards have lifetime tenure?"

Actually now that I remember it, he was afraid to drive that car when he took delivery - so he had me drive him around in it for a few days. Pretty funny."
24,2009-10-07T20:28:52+00:00,boomchek,"One guy that worked with us was telling me of his ""friends"" that livged in the same building as him. One has a new GT-R, and a CL63 AMG, and another onee just got an Audi R8, and another got something else.

I see kids driving in Aston Martins around here too."
25,2009-10-07T22:27:28+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, that is something I have noticed in that area for awhile. I remember maybe 10 years ago walking on Burrard and seeing a kid in a F355 Spider who was doing a laughable job operating the transmission. I rarely see such shenanigans with young people in my neighborhood...at most a kid dorking around in mommy's Range Rover or daddy's high end Porsche. Cops around here are usually strict, so they don't flaunt speed too much."
26,2009-10-07T22:35:20+00:00,british_rover,"I tried to sell a SC range Rover sport to a kid like that from Turkey.

Truly insane money but a decent enough kid. Was trying to trade in a beat 335i hard top vert that was probably the second or third sold in the state. He had managed to do a number on the paint in 8,000 miles though."
27,2009-10-08T00:37:55+00:00,boomchek,"Most of the satellite kids here are from Hong Kong and China.

When I worked at my old Honda dealer, there was a lot boy working at another dealer across the street for $8/hour, but he was driving a brand new black Land Rover Sport, right when they just came out. Crazy."
28,2009-10-08T03:08:56+00:00,fintail,"My old roomate was from Taiwan. He said his father drove a big old MB, a very unusual car there. He didn't know what it was...so I gave him a book and had him point it out. He was sure it was a W126. Those have to be uncommon there...although many were sold in HK. He'd sometimes go with me out in the fintail...he got a kick out of something so old, and maybe it gave him a little feeling of home, too.

I remember he also said Ford Taurus and Nissan Altimas were considered to be high class cars there."
29,2009-10-08T03:10:35+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, those might not be the best people to buy used cars from. As many would say, people who don't buy their own things don't take care of them.

I remember the guy I knew would see me using a squeegee to dry the old non-clearcoat paint on the fintail - so the first time his new car got wet, he did the same thing. Put a big scratch right down the hood. He took it back and begged the dealer to buff it out, which they did."
30,2009-10-10T18:40:02+00:00,explorerx4,"saw my first 'on the road' Ford GT. White with blue stripes.
then in the parking lot at Lowes, a new Camaro, a new Challenger r/t, a Charger r/t, and a Mustang GT500.
it's October in New England and I am in the home improvement store parking lot.
felt weird."

I'm worried about the company already."
34,2009-10-13T18:36:07+00:00,boomchek,"The website is not working and I think this is the wrong thread for it anyways.

If you guys want some exposure you should contact Edmunds and either get them to review and test drive your vehicle, or put in some paid ads

For $14k - $15k I'd rather buy:

A Kia Forte, Rio, or Soul and have a 10 year warranty
A Hyundai Accent or Elantra
A base Ford Focus or Nissan Versa
A Dodge Caliber
or even a Chevy Aveo
A Smart car.

All of the above come from an established manufacturer, with some sort of a decent warranty, and most important, they look like normal vehicles with 4 wheels. Plus I'd feel much safer in the above than in a 3 wheel golf cart thingy. Even the smart car is priced less, offers decent fuel economy, and was engineered by Mercedes.

Maybe your product would do better if it's priced at the $7k-$8k mark.

PS: you spelled Seabring wrong. It should be Sebring."
35,2009-10-13T20:32:24+00:00,stever,"Runs on spam?

I must have seen half a dozen new Prius yesterday.

In this political town, no surprise, I guess."

I say this because I was driving the fintail, and I pulled up beside him at a gas station. He looked at me like I was stepping out of a spaceship :shades: ....it was cool to see 50 years of progress next to each other."
44,2009-10-19T17:39:21+00:00,boomchek,"That's funny. And here he thought he'd be youthful by buying a new E class, and then he sees a youth driving something that's almost half a century old."
45,2009-10-19T17:42:01+00:00,ateixeira,"Well, new may be youthful, but I doubt the median age for an E class owner is any lower than 50 plus.

Of course to someone that old, 50 may seem ""youthful""."
46,2009-10-19T19:06:04+00:00,fintail,"I'm no youth anymore lol ...but yeah, this guy was probably in his late 70s at the youngest. Although I have to say, if I am that old and driving that car, I'd be pretty happy.

His wife did look a good 20 years younger...but it was probably his daughter :shades:"

27,2009-11-10T23:11:43+00:00,lvranger,I was in Tucson last weekend and saw a VW that looked like the old Eurovans they used to sell here only it was twice as big. Looked like a Dodge Sprinter but it was definitely a VW. It was going the other way so I couldn't read the model emblem. Any ideas?
28,2009-11-10T23:15:25+00:00,stever,Was it new? Not a Routan? They look more like Dodge Caravans (which they are). Not twice as big as the old EuroVans though. Maybe a Mexican VW (Volksbus)?
29,2009-11-11T00:22:28+00:00,kyfdx,"Routan..

Ford Transit Connect

Audi A6 Avant (really cool)"
30,2009-11-11T22:35:19+00:00,lvranger,"Definitely not a Routan. This looked like a work vehicle, a Sprinter with VW emblems. Tucson is about an hour from the border so maybe this was something sold in Mexico."
31,2009-11-11T22:41:00+00:00,lvranger,"I had a Transit Connect blow by me doing at least 70 in a 45. I didn't think that little 2.0 had it in it. There were pest control signs all over it.

34,2009-11-12T17:06:30+00:00,lemko,...black Mercedes C300 at the Acme market on Oxford Ave in NE Philly at lunchtime. It's a lousy day to be driving a black car! It's going to be a spotted mess when the sun returns. I left my black Cadillac DTS at home today!
35,2009-11-12T18:15:05+00:00,boomchek,Maybe it was the VW Transporter. The current generation is sold in Mexico under the Eurovan nameplate.
36,2009-11-12T22:17:56+00:00,british_rover,Lots of Transit Connects around here. Good vehicle for a small business that needs to carry medium to light weight things plus the FWD for screwy new england weather.
37,2009-11-12T23:45:39+00:00,lvranger,Thats it! What a cool van. If it was cheaper than a Sprinter and came with a diesel i'd sell my long bed for one. Too bad no USA version. Maybe there is a grey market for them.
38,2009-11-18T13:45:51+00:00,lemko,Spotted both a silver 2010 Ford Taurus and a dark grey 2010 Fusion on my way home from work last night.
39,2009-11-18T13:45:59+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Got tailgated on the highway (in the fast lane doing probably 80) by some prick in a new jet black CTS.

Here's the weird thing, is it normal that when you turn the blinkers on on those things that the headlight turns off? It was night time and he had the headlights on (No DRL's) and everytime he put his blinker on, the headlight would go out. :confuse:"
40,2009-11-18T17:10:24+00:00,british_rover,"Did the headlight go out or did it move? Many newer cars have adaptive lights that will turn to the side when turning or when using the blinkers.

Saw the first SHO Taurus out with real plates on it today. I live midway between three large Ford dealers so have seen a few with dealer plates but first one out in the wild.

Also seeing lots more Transit Connect Vans those are selling very well."
41,2009-11-18T18:00:11+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I think it just went out, it was like the headlight and the blinker were switching blinker on, headlight off and vice versa. It was too fast to be actually turning away and back again. And we were driving on a straight highway, He was using the blinker so he pass me on the inside."
42,2009-11-18T18:13:52+00:00,british_rover,Maybe its a short thats a weird thing to happen on any car but it is possible.
43,2009-11-18T19:20:44+00:00,boomchek,"It's normal. Chryslers and Dodges have the same feature. When you put a blinker on the headlight goes off, I presume to make the blinker more visible.

I was weirded out the first time I saw it too on a brand new Dodge Ram I sold. mistakenly thought it was an electrical problem."
44,2009-11-18T19:54:39+00:00,stever,"That's odd; never heard that one before.

My van has a ""cornering"" light - when you put the blinker on, another light comes on to illuminate the side that you are turning toward. I don't think I like the idea of my headlight going off when I signal."
45,2009-11-18T20:15:07+00:00,boomchek,"Not both of your headlights go off, just the one next to the blinker."
46,2009-11-18T20:15:17+00:00,british_rover,"I can see that happening when the DRLs are on but with full power lights too? Seems dumb.

Now I am going to have to go next door and drive a Ram to see how that works."
47,2009-11-18T20:40:54+00:00,stever,"just the one next to the blinker

Understood, but I don't think I like the idea of any of them going out. Maybe I need to be educated more about the benefits but it seems ""wrong"". Is it really that hard to see an amber turn signal against a headlight?"
48,2009-11-18T20:54:17+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I don't know if Crysler does this, but the yahoos over at Government Motors also thought it was smart to have the reverse lights stay on once the vehicle was put in park :confuse: . So I'm not really surprised that they have this feature as well, they probably think its some revolutionary breakthru when it's really just awkward."
49,2009-11-18T21:17:26+00:00,lvranger,I wonder if the new caddy headlights are LEDs. I know the LEDs on Audis turn off when the turnsignal is used.
0,2009-11-19T02:55:21+00:00,imidazol97,"GM had a ""safety salute"" when dimming headlights a few years back. When switching between brights to dims, the lights would do an extra blink to draw attention to the dimming."
1,2009-11-19T12:17:47+00:00,rockshocka1,"I know the LEDs on Audis turn off when the turnsignal is used.

I had read somewhere on these forums, maybe a blog, a similiar statement with regard to the S5. That the DRLs shut off on whatever side the blinker being used is on.

I can't say for sure what happens at speed, but while sitting at a light waiting to turn, I can see the headlamp, DRL eyeliner & blinker all on at the same time in the reflection of the car in front of me.

I'll have to have somebody drive in front of me to see if there is any difference when changing lanes at speed."
2,2009-11-19T14:40:24+00:00,fintail,"I've noticed that too, at speed anyway when a modern Audi signals, the LED goes out while the signal is on. Saw a lot of them in Germany (where the A4 sells like a Camcord), it caught my eye."
3,2009-11-19T15:04:25+00:00,lemko,"Hmmmm! I wonder if my DTS does the same thing. If it does, I never noticed it while driving the car. Does it only happen when the car is moving or can I park it in the driveway at night, turn on the lights, turn on the blinker and walk in front of the car and see it?"
4,2009-11-19T21:49:26+00:00,british_rover,Your DTS has LED daytime running lights?
5,2009-11-20T12:05:35+00:00,rockshocka1,"Upon further review, my LED DRLs do cut off when the blinker is on, even if the car is in park.

Only excuse I can come up with is the reflection of my headlamp from the car in front of me shines back on the DRLs making them appear (to me) to be on in tandem with the blinker.

That's my story & I'm sticking to it. Off for an eye exam. :blush:"
6,2009-11-23T20:20:42+00:00,fintail,Saw one of those new retractable roof Lexus coupes today. The driver was the exact stereotype of who would drive such a car. I love the relationship between smoke and fire :shades:

I can't get wormed up to it's looks. I like the sedan but the convertible seems odd proportioned, especially the rear end. The BMW 3 series is so much nicer imo.

I even like the Lexus SC converttibles better than the IS."
8,2009-11-23T21:28:34+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, the IS. It is odd behind the A-pillar, and has big obvious ""cracks"" in the roof where it folds. Not a pretty design, but pretentious enough to attract its chosen demographic."

It wasn't until we were all accelerating onto the highway that it caught my eye. If it wasn't for the Robin's Egg Blue color, even then I might not have taken note. Then it took me a little while to figure it out. I thought Eclipse? (thanks to that rear seat window kink) Na. Lexus? (not sure what made me think that) Na. Tibby? Na. OH! Now I see the 2.0T badge and it all makes sense.

Eh. Not a bad looking car. It just doesn't stand out."
11,2009-11-27T19:40:01+00:00,boomchek,"They're pudgy looking things. I saw one at a dealer close by. Weird proportions, High cowl, just odd looking car. The new RX looks odd to me too. I don't like the styling of many of today's new cars. It seems like they have weird lines just for the sake of having weird lines. Tack on chrome in random places and played out fender vents and supposedly you have a luxury car. Blah :lemon:"
12,2009-11-27T20:47:06+00:00,fintail,"Different for the sake of being different...no doubt that mindset exists in more than a few designers. The Lexus does seem kind of stubby, like the hood and trunk should be a little bigger to make it look balanced.

Fake (usually) fender vents are probably one of the lamest things seen on recent cars."
13,2009-11-27T21:32:35+00:00,boomchek,I agree. Especially the ones on the recent Focus. They remind me of the shiny plastic chrome on toys that peels off after a few years.

17,2009-11-28T04:40:11+00:00,fintail,"I think it's funny that the Focus moved away from that. If it's too lame for the already dumbed-down NA Focus, that should give people a general hint."

20,2009-11-30T16:37:15+00:00,qbrozen,"but I spotted a 2010 Stang on the road. Was driving alongside it, in front of it, and behind it for many many miles on the Parkway. Seeing the original pics prior to its release, I didn't think it would be easily distinguishable from the outgoing model. But I see now I was wrong. I immediately identified it and could see how different it actually is from every angle."
21,2009-11-30T17:11:15+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw this at a dealership, went just out of curiosity.

It looks a little less ugly in person, still not attractive by any stretch. It just looks like a pregnant Accord. Not really crossover-ish like the Venza, not as raised up as an Outback.

There's only 31"" between the wheel wells, hard to believe for such a large vehicle. Outback is a whole foot wider there. They really sacrificed cargo room plus 1500 lbs towing really limits the utility.

Blind spots are pretty bad for lane changes. Backing up is fine, as it has that Insight-style mini-window under the rear hatch.

Interior is decent enough, pretty much Accord.

EX-L with Navi stickered for $37k, ouch.

I still bet they sell a bunch of 'em."

24,2009-12-02T14:19:23+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Went to N.O. for the Patriots stomping game over the weekend and saw a few interesting sightings. First, the place is awesome but for car owners, it wasn't exactly a macca of clean, well maintained vehicles either.

Anyways, lotsa Mercedes (C-classes especially), many 3-series and even a brand new Ferrari parked on Bourbon St. at the height of foot traffic I think there was a muscle car convention going on somewhere because there were parades of Mustangs and Camaros cruising Canal Street all weekend.

The only other thing worth mentioning is the disturbing trend for jacking up cars to SUV heights and slapping 24"" low profile wheels under them. I must've seen a dozen of these jalopies (Older GM Caprices, Fleetwoods, Delta 88's and Malibus) and once you get past the gaudy paint jobs and flashy frying pan wheels, they were one foot in the scrapyard and creaked, groaned and squeeked badly. Blech. :sick: The roads are a disaster down there and wreaked havoc on suspensions so I wasn't surprised/ But what I was surpised by was the number of later model vehicles that also creaked and squeeked and how a majority of them were GM and Fords (Trailblazer clones and Explorers).

Saints romped the Pats and it was tough to hang my head up high after witnessing such a beating. Still a great place though. :shades:"
25,2009-12-03T21:57:38+00:00,lvranger,Not trying to nit pick but I think they are supercharged. The last TT S4 was two generations ago.

36,2009-12-10T03:06:49+00:00,fintail,"Not brand new, but I had a S63 AMG parked beside me in the garage at work. It backed into the spot...against a wall...so close I think he might have bumped it. Must be another one of the overpaid executive clowns :lemon:"

40,2009-12-10T20:14:43+00:00,british_rover,Ferrari does that to some extent. When the Enzo came out he wanted to buy one and certainly had the money but Ferrari wouldn't sell him one. At the time he had only owned two Ferraris. He had a F360 at the time and had had another Ferrari previously. He hadn't owned enough Ferraris to qualify for an Enzo so they wouldn't sell him one. He bought a 575M instead and then later on a F430. When he was going to replace the 575M with another F430 he had a chance to buy an Enzo used but just couldn't justify the price.
41,2009-12-10T20:32:41+00:00,boomchek,"I heards that too with the F50. After you passed the requirements of owning XX ferraris), and then you try and get an F50.

According to my desktop Car and Driver calendar:

""In order to protect it from market specualtion, the F50 was leased to its ""owners"" for two years ($240000 down, $5000 a month) with an option to buy at the end of the lease for an additional $150000,"
42,2009-12-10T21:10:40+00:00,bumpy,"Back in the bad old days, the luxury marques wouldn't sell to blacks, Jews, etc. in order to maintain their cachet with their bigoted clientele."
43,2009-12-10T21:40:11+00:00,fintail,"No worries, smart money buys late model used anyway. :shades:

A few brands for a while have become a magnet for idiotic corporate clowns or leaser poseurs who often drive like jerks and create negative associations with entire brands. BMW was there, Audi is getting there."
44,2009-12-10T21:43:55+00:00,fintail,"He was probably better off anyway :shades:

And that strategy doesn't look to have turned him off the brand either....maybe a better owner than some of the lameo celebs who ended up with those things."
45,2009-12-10T21:46:28+00:00,british_rover,I think that would be more the dealers then the brand themselves. Few brands have the kind of control of their dealer network that Ferrari does.
46,2009-12-10T22:41:14+00:00,lemko,"Just the fact that he parked the car so close to the wall risking scuffing the bumper shows he has no respect for the car. He's so rich, he can just buy another one tomorrow if it becomes too marked-up. Whereas if I had scuffed the bumper on my Cadillac, I'd be apoplectic! People who really care about the cars and don't just have them as shiny status symbols have a far different attitude toward them."
47,2009-12-10T22:58:57+00:00,boomchek,"I see that with young kids who's parents just buy them whatever car they want. They usually don't look after them very well, and end up crashing them. :sick:

49,2009-12-10T23:23:08+00:00,fintail,"It was insanely close, less than a cm no doubt. I should have snapped a pic. I know the car has parktronic, and maybe he just likes to test its accuracy...but I doubt it. The car was also dirty. I have also seen a SL63 in the same garage...I wonder if it is the same owner. Of course, the rank and file have to live lean while these guys buy these things. Where's the mob with pitchforks and guillotines when they are needed :shades:"
0,2009-12-10T23:24:54+00:00,fintail,"For me, those vehicles make the image no matter who drives them.

Always amused me that wannabe gangsta rappaz, vacuous affluent housewives, and aging WASP men like the same vehicles.

And on the new car subject...in this economy I notice a lot less newer versions of those things than I used to spot. Maybe one good thing about these slow times."
1,2009-12-10T23:26:27+00:00,fintail,"That's probably more of a problem in Van than most places on the continent, with the abundance of transplanted, suspicious, and often irresponsible wealth. I see things there that are never seen to the south."
2,2009-12-10T23:58:55+00:00,boomchek,"Hmmm. Should I consider myself lucky for driving in a sea of BMWs, Mercedeses, and new Porsches among other things, or unlucky because I'm not the one driving them

Heck, I see a Porsche Cayennes and BMW X6s probably 4 to 5 times a day. It would be more if I'd poke my head out of my showroom more often. And this isn't even in down town or any affluent area.

Last cool sighting was a new S Class with what appeared to be a full on Lorinser treatment. The wheels looked very sharp."
3,2009-12-11T01:29:24+00:00,lemko,"Where's the mob with pitchforks and guillotines when they are needed

If for nothing other than to rescue beautiful cars like the S63 from neglectful rich slobs. I bet most of the surviving classic luxury cars out there belonged to original owners who were true auto enthusiasts or second owners of more modest means who appreciated them - not status-seeking overpaid fat slobs whose only notable trait is having been born with the right last name."
4,2009-12-11T02:06:58+00:00,fintail,"It's exactly the same in the boom-burb where I live. I see high end everything all the time - I am desensitized to it. Sometimes it hard to turn a corner without seeing a late model Range Rover/Cayenne/GL-G/X5 (X6 isn't so big here for some reason) etc. It is kind of cool in that one gets to see new models pretty quickly after introduction.

Around here my old W210 is probably seen as old and worthless by the trust-funder cowards and other posers...but that's fine with me. Real enthusiasts know better.

I saw some kind of tricked out W211 on my way home tonight...lowered looking, big wheels, silver and spotless...but I don't think it was an AMG car."
5,2009-12-11T02:10:57+00:00,fintail,"I have a feeling the original owner of my E55 was that way. It had low mileage, sold just out of warranty. It was spotless inside, but showed some careless ownership outside, that I corrected over a period of months. No window sticker or important records were kept, and the jerk lost the spare key. The dealer told me the guy came in and bought a new LS (this is when the new style just came out) for cash. I bet that harsh suspension wore him out, and he needed some isolation :shades: The car certainly gets more love now than it did the first half of its life.

A spotless older model gets more respect from me than a neglected new car being driven for attention. That works for all makes."
6,2009-12-11T13:13:57+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Spotted a new Panamera in Silver.

Um no thanks. :sick:"
7,2009-12-11T15:29:34+00:00,lemko,"Your blue fintail, (what year is it again? I keep thinking 1965) would attract more attention than a slovenly new S63. There's a lady in my neighborhood who drives an early 1980s W126 that looks spotless. When I traded my 2002 Cadillac Seville STS, I had provided a thick binder with all the service records going all the way back to the day I purchased it. I hope somebody who really appreciates the car bought it.

Per new car spotting, I spotted a new dark gray Challenger Hemi across from the neighborhood post office on Rising Sun Avenue this morning."
8,2009-12-11T16:15:01+00:00,fintail,"The fintail is a special case...it gets attention like a Ferrari would (it's a 64). I've had someone follow me in it to ask me questions...and almost every time I drive it I get a wave or a thumbs up, and people will often compliment it in a parking lot or gas station. I do keep it spotless, and it is a perfect period color...that helps.

When I sold my W126 I wanted it to go to a good home, and I made sure it went to someone who knew MB and would keep it maintained. I have no doubts it is still on the road. Those cars will always turn my head. A pristine W126 has as much class as any new car.

I think I actually saw a Panamera this morning too. It was still pretty dark and it was at a slight distance, but I saw something with that big and weird shape."
9,2009-12-12T22:17:18+00:00,fintail,"Quite a few new cars today...saw a new 5er, E63, various new normal Es (at the MB dealer), a couple of S400 hybrids (one loaded sticker at 110K!), Panamera, Accord Crosstour, and the big new Subaru sedan."
10,2009-12-12T23:42:02+00:00,boomchek,"Yeah I saw a new Legacy Wagon today, not sure if it was an Outback or not, but it looked huge, like a mid size SUV, not just a jacked up wagon anymore."
11,2009-12-13T00:47:50+00:00,fintail,"I think Subaru might get a little too big and SUV-ish...they'd better be careful.

The Crosstour is also even more bland and pointless looking in person than in pics. Sure beats the cool Euro Accord wagon, right :sick: ZDX will be just as awesome, can't wait to see one of those."
12,2009-12-13T04:14:18+00:00,qbrozen,"I think Subaru might get a little too big and SUV-ish...they'd better be careful.

They already crossed that line, IMHO. :sick:
The new outback is only an inch shorter (height) than a Murano. So much for being a station wagon."
13,2009-12-14T00:01:43+00:00,fintail,Saw a Kia Forte today...on a local Enterprise lot.
14,2009-12-14T13:51:12+00:00,anythngbutgm,"but 2 Crosstours on Saturday, both in the same read that has been shown in photographs. Compare to the 30 odd Venzas I saw as well that afternoon and it'll be interesting to see if Honda can crack that market."
15,2009-12-14T16:38:41+00:00,ateixeira,"Folks, Outback sales were up 142% last month. :surprise:

They actually ran out of 3.6R models with Navi. 6-8 week wait for those via factory order.

They're big, sure, but Subaru is building exactly what Americans want."

Oh, I'm sure they are.

But they never did before, so why start now? :P
I assume they've decided that being ""niche"" is not enough. Took them quite some time to come to that realization, though."
17,2009-12-14T16:51:28+00:00,ateixeira,"LOL!

Apparently US buyers did not want compact, manual transmission-ed, station wagons.

20,2009-12-14T19:08:10+00:00,boomchek,"it'll be interesting to see if Honda can crack that market.

Not with the Crosstour they won't. The Venza is so much more stylish. It can totally pass off as a Lexus just with a different badge."
21,2009-12-14T19:39:50+00:00,ateixeira,"Problem is if you asked enthusiasts like us to build a car, you'd end up with a diesel-only 6 speed manual sporty compact wagon that 3 of us would buy and love, but the public wouldn't go anywhere near."
22,2009-12-14T19:41:31+00:00,ateixeira,"I went to check out the Crosstour...31"" between the wheel wells, more than a foot more narrow than the Outback's cargo area.

Blind spots were bad, except backing up.

Price is a couple grand higher, and that Honda dealer was out of brochures already.

I'm not sure how many people will actually buy them, but they get a ton of traffic from Accord shoppers so it will probably still sell well."
23,2009-12-14T21:36:37+00:00,british_rover,Now take the profits from those sales and build a couple of neat midsized to compact wagons with manuals. You won't get a lot of sales but you would be the only company building them so you would get a few more sales.
24,2009-12-14T22:18:55+00:00,fintail,That will tell us what Subaru is all about today...what it does with the profits from these overgrown things.
25,2009-12-15T00:49:03+00:00,ateixeira,"Let's be fair - they still make the WRX with a manual, not to mention the Impreza and Outback Sport 5 doors, also with manuals.

And the Legacy GT is among the sportiest in the mainstream large sedan class.

Too bad they don't sell the Legacy wagon here. They do in other markets."
26,2009-12-15T02:46:33+00:00,fintail,"That new Legacy just looks too big to me. That and it resembles an Accord to my eyes. So now it's an Accord with AWD... I hope that isn't Subaru's product differentiation plan.

It seems the NA market is where one can find all of the heavy and kind of dumbed down products. Shocking. Other markets also get diesel models...a ""new"" car one will probably never see on this side of the pond."
27,2009-12-15T03:36:11+00:00,qbrozen,"The Legacy is now 3500 lbs! No thanks.

A compact manual diesel wagon? Hey, Juice, are you reading my diary?! :mad:"
28,2009-12-15T15:00:27+00:00,ateixeira,Actually the diesel is supposed to come. I think it would pair up well with the mission of a Forester or Outback.
29,2009-12-15T17:00:25+00:00,british_rover,"Yup like Porsche. They took a good junk of the profits from the pepper and made the Cayman which is an awesome car.

31,2009-12-15T18:49:25+00:00,fintail,"Wasn't a Honda diesel supposed to come too? I haven't spotted one yet.

In Europe, Switzerland especially, I saw several Foresters - all of them diesel. However, I have to wonder if this new SUV-ish model might be too big for the continental market. It wouldn't be cool if Subaru developed like Honda, with better or more sensibly sized cars available on the Euro market."
32,2009-12-15T18:51:05+00:00,fintail,"Yes, Porsche managed the Cayenne right...sold to a certain target market, but put the money back into real cars. Normal Porsches are as good as ever today...a testament to good intentions.

German megalomaniacal automotive management is amusing...it goes back at least to the time when MB tried to take over BMW 50 years ago."
33,2009-12-15T18:52:35+00:00,ateixeira,"Foresters are still very compact - shorter overall than a Chevy Cobalt coupe.

I guess in Europe it may be considered a mid-size, but not large."
34,2009-12-15T18:53:49+00:00,fintail,"But wider and taller, yes? It sure looks like a little tank, compared to the more petite looking old model."
35,2009-12-15T18:59:27+00:00,ateixeira,"Well, I feel qualified to comment since I owned the original (1998 model) for 9 years and we now have a 2009.

It is a lot taller, but that doesn't make it any harder to park.

It's a little wider but still feels small compared to the Sienna we also own.

The best part is that the turning circle is actually tighter, despite a much longer wheelbase. So it's easier to manuever and park. Visibility is excellent on both, with narrow pillars and acres of glass.

Overall I think the 09 is just as suited to Europe's small spaces as my '98 was."
36,2009-12-15T19:04:24+00:00,fintail,"I guess we will see how the market there reacts to an obviously Americanized product. You are probably right in that it probably won't matter, as Subie is a much more niche player there even than it is here."
37,2009-12-15T19:05:53+00:00,ateixeira,"It did get biggie-sized, but the Forester didn't get big the same way the Outback did. It's still lighter and smaller than most of its primary competition."
38,2009-12-15T19:12:49+00:00,fintail,"And if anything, maybe Euro customers put off by the gigantic Outback will move to the Forester. I think the brand does develop loyalty. The Outback at least looks bigger than the Forester now."
39,2009-12-15T19:45:04+00:00,ateixeira,"I think the brand does develop loyalty

Big time, per RL Polk Subaru is the #1 mainstream brand, Forester is the #1 compact utility, and Outback is the #1 mid-size utility for owner loyalty.

We're on our 3rd Subaru. :shades:"

The car refusted to start one morning, :mad: luckily in the hotel lot outside Yosemite and not at a parking lot inside the park. The rental company trucked up a replacement 4 hrs later. A Monte Carlo, :sick:"
4,2010-01-10T20:12:55+00:00,stever,"I reserved a car from Alamo last month down in Austin. Naturally they were out of the subcompacts I had reserved (er, yeah, that's why I reserve 'em - I like free upgrades).

They sent us down the aisle and told us to pick whatever we wanted among the dozen cars parked there. There was an HHR, two PT Cruisers, a Dodge Magnum, and the little white car we chose. A Hyundai Elantra. We came real close to taking one the PTs, but didn't make the plunge.

We put ~1700 miles on it; I did all the driving and found it quite comfy. Plenty of cockpit room for an Idaho wide stance driving position (I hate it when my knees get cramped by the armrest or console). It only felt a bit ragged flooring it onto the freeways up to 80mph. The only regret was that I forget to bring a UBS stick loaded with tunes."
5,2010-01-10T21:33:07+00:00,fintail,"My mother was thrown off by the window switches being high on the console...she never even thought to look there. She had to dig out the owners manual to find them. She also didn't like it because she thought it was too loud, and kind of shoddily built. But at least it didn't break down.

Speaking of rental convertibles, a friend of mine rented a deluxe convertible (I forget from which company)..he got a Z-car...but the convertible top was jammed and wouldn't go down. He exchanged it for a Solara, which for some reason he liked. He's on the road now and called me this morning about his current rental. He reserved the cheapest thing, and he got it - a Kia Rio.

It makes one envious of the rental fleets I saw in Germany."
6,2010-01-10T23:04:28+00:00,ghulet,"My mom, since her 300E died some two years ago, has been driving rental cars exclusively (I know, don't ask, it's a point of much debate). So far: a basic Mitsubishi Galant (liked), a Maxima (hated it, said it was a guzzler), Charger (hated, she referred to it as 'the Batmobile'), a Sonata (recent, she mostly liked) and several HHRs (she pretty much likes, for the cargo space). She's convinced, because of retirement and apparently so-so credit, that she can't buy a car....apparently it's better to spend twice as much on a monthly rental. :confuse: Because nobody else in the U.S. in a not-so-great financial position (never mind her home equity) has ever bought a car."
7,2010-01-11T00:12:23+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, like all of our mothers can be, she's a little off. What's a monthly rental running her, maybe $600/mo? Even if her credit isn't perfect, I have to imagine she could get something of her own for that. I bet if she checked her credit report she would be pleasantly surprised, too.

I rented a Galant back in November...it was so-so. It was economical and had no problems even at 40K, but the throttle was way too sensitive for my tastes, and the interior plastics were less than impressive."
8,2010-01-11T01:19:51+00:00,kyfdx,"HHRs are actually okay..

PT Cruisers... less so, but bearable..

Calibers... worst ever.."
9,2010-01-11T01:45:57+00:00,andys120,"Actually a Cobalt was one of the better rentals I've driven in recent years, it was fairly lively yet economical. Much better than the PTC and a little better than a Focus.

The lame-o styling would keep me from ever buying one but it's a good temporary car.
IIRC the HHR is the same car with different bodywork."
10,2010-01-11T01:52:01+00:00,kyfdx,"I will say.. if you are driving the HHR in an unfamiliar location, in the dark.. trying to follow a detour on your GPS, because a co-worker, (who drives for a living), failed to tell you that a major state highway was closed for a bridge outage (when you specifically asked him about the route you should take), and you slam on the brakes because the road is out ahead, and you need to make a left turn...

.. then, that box of donuts on the back seat will flip over on to the floorboard... but, you'll put on the flashers.. get out and pick them up and put them back in the box... and, never say a word when you put them out at the meeting..

Other than that, the HHR was just fine.."
11,2010-01-11T02:03:17+00:00,ateixeira,"I talked a friend out of a PT, asking him, ""you really want a Neon-based multi-purpose vehicle built in Mexico?"""
12,2010-01-11T12:05:46+00:00,ghulet,"that sounds like a completely rhetorical situation, though. Still, I guess that could happen, though."
13,2010-01-11T18:50:40+00:00,boomchek,Would that be an Edmunds hosts' meeting by any chance? :P
14,2010-01-11T20:04:31+00:00,qbrozen,Saw my first X6 in person today. A bit better looking than in the pics.
15,2010-01-11T20:15:32+00:00,boomchek,"One looked like a base model with ugly wheels. Dark blue. The other a yellow RS.

Not a bad car but not special looking by any means. I think the Challenger looks a bit more stylish."
16,2010-01-11T20:17:23+00:00,ateixeira,"Same here, in terms of styling. I'll like the way the Mustang sounds the best, and the Camaro's performance. Any chance to combine the 3?"
17,2010-01-11T21:14:35+00:00,fintail,"Local MB dealer suddenly has a pile of new E-class on the lot...must have been 15 cars. Must be expecting good sales.

The diesel version of that thing needs to come back asap. I have read in 2011 we'll see a C250 diesel."
18,2010-01-11T23:42:09+00:00,kyfdx,Ha! No... we only meet in cyberspace!
19,2010-01-14T20:22:37+00:00,lemko,...champagne-colored Mercedes CLK 320 - a true hardtop - next to me in traffic where Oxford Avenue and Verree Road fork in Fox Chase in NE Philly.
20,2010-01-14T22:58:34+00:00,fintail,"It may have looked new, but model year 2005 was the last for the CLK 320 IIRC...replaced by the 350 for 06 and with slight cosmetic changes in 07. :shades:

On the hardtop note, MB has offered at least one true hardtop model in the US each year from 1961-today."
21,2010-01-19T15:09:04+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Saw my second new SRX this morning, once again this one was Silver. Looks decent but heavy. I also don't think it will age well over the long run.

I have yet to see a new Lacrosse on the road and the new Equinox is rare. Still only seen one new Terrain which is the same one I see every morning on my way to work. In contrast I've seen 2 new Sorrentos already and those things just came out...

Outside of Government Motors stuff, couple of GLK's, lotsa new Outbacks and Foresters, only one or two new Legacys mixed in with the numerous Accords, Altimas and Camrys out there.

As far as exotics, as expected none with all the white stuff around"
22,2010-01-19T15:58:29+00:00,anythngbutgm,"You know what I've been seeing a bunch of lately? Mitsubishi Outlanders! Even the brand new, redesigned model with the EVO nose has been sighted a bunch of times already. Heck, the first generation models 2004? can be found, I just saw two of them in a small in town parking lot over the weekend. Seems like a popular model or are they just giving big incentives on those?"
23,2010-01-19T16:25:49+00:00,ateixeira,"Outback and Forester are indeed selling briskly.

Legacy sedans are not being produced in large numbers, plus demand for Outback is stronger, so in the Subaru threads there are people having trouble finding loaded Outbacks and Legacy sedans, too.

Equinox is selling well - again it's a matter of not enough supply. Same for the Terrain."
24,2010-01-19T22:59:46+00:00,fushigi,"I see the Outlander all the time. There's a red '10 GT in my garage.

There were just a couple of incentives on it when I bought it last month beyond the owner loyalty (which I got) and other day-to-day incentives like college grad & military. There is/was a Sam's Club deal on leases but leases don't make sense for my ownership pattern. There was also a 0% for 36 months, which I opted out of as I didn't want a payment that high. They may have added incentives since I bought; I don't know & the Mitsu site is down due to the California weather.

There were numerous improvements for 2010, including a better interior, more powerful & fuel efficient V6 with better AWD system, better stereo (now 710 watts), etc.

And Mitsu, following their typical advertise-one-car-at-a-time pattern is advertising the Outlander right now."
25,2010-01-20T01:45:39+00:00,ateixeira,"That's the ad with the invisible people in it, right?"
26,2010-01-20T02:07:35+00:00,fintail,"I've seen several new Equinox and/or their clone in the past couple days.

Spotted a Taurus too."
27,2010-01-20T02:10:05+00:00,ateixeira,I see more Equinox (dozens) than I do Terrains (2 or 3). Wonder what the sales split is?
28,2010-01-20T11:48:57+00:00,fushigi,Yep. Not really the best car commercial I've ever seen but not bad and at least it is somewhat unique.
29,2010-01-20T13:05:57+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Seen a bunch of the new Golf model (love the redesign btw) and this morning saw my first new GTi. I don't know what it is about the GTi but it just has the right look about it. The proportions, the short overhangs and the tight seams just makes it look so much more expensive than it actually is. I can't for the life of me figure out why no other automaker can come up with their own 2 door hatch like that with a hot drivetrain. Hey, maybe someone unexpected like Mitsubishi can jump into the ring, I bet it would be a gamechanger for them. I had hopes for Honda but unless they can make it a jacked up SUV over 5 times bigger and twice as heavy they won't go for it :P"
30,2010-01-20T14:07:43+00:00,lemko,...just bought a new Chevrolet Cobalt sedan. It's sort of a greenish-silver color.
31,2010-01-20T15:00:34+00:00,ateixeira,"Found it, for those who haven't seen it yet:

That reminds me of this Kia commercial with the hamsters, except it's all other cars that are invisible, besides the Soul:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUiO7Ouon9c"
32,2010-01-20T17:09:23+00:00,ghulet,"....but I just saw 'The Price is Right'; one of the showcase contestants overbid on his showcase, which included a Porsche Boxter, by $176 :sick: I wanted to cry for him. I very rarely see Boxters here in Chicago (they don't make a lot of sense here--well, once in a while I'll see one in the tonier neighborhoods, i.e., the Gold Coast and some north shore suburbs)."
33,2010-01-20T17:22:17+00:00,fushigi,It definitely doesn't qualify as new but once or twice a year I'll spot a Delorean driving around Westmont. Then again my commute does take me past the Bentley & Lambo dealers. :surprise:
34,2010-01-21T13:59:17+00:00,lemko,...new black 2010 Buick LaCrosse at Bleigh and Oxford in NE Philly this morning on my way to work.
35,2010-01-21T19:36:36+00:00,boomchek,Last time I saw a Delorean anywhere in the wild was in Beverly Hills 2 years ago in Beverly Hills when I was with my wife on her business trip.
36,2010-01-22T02:23:05+00:00,fintail,Spotted another Taurus today...a few must be selling.
37,2010-01-22T14:58:41+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw one on Canal Rd in Georgetown going home yesterday.

I dunno, not liking these narrow windows. I'm sure visibility was better on the Five Hundred.

Plus it just seems huge. The Fusion is more right-sized.

Of course from a Miata anything seems big."
38,2010-01-22T15:36:21+00:00,fintail,"There's still a market for larger cars, I guess.

I don't like the gun-slit window trend, in the name of ""safety"" but also to give an isolated feel as demanded by the lowest common denominator driver who doesn't pay attention to their surroundings anyway.

The Fusion is a much more appropriately sized vehicle for me too. I remember someone mentioned the Taurus is reminiscent of the 65 Ford...in a way I can really see that."
39,2010-01-24T18:04:40+00:00,fintail,"About a dozen new E class sedans and half a dozen new E class coupes at the local MB dealership this morning. Three Camaros at the Chevy dealership, and a Panamera sitting at the Porsche lot."
40,2010-01-25T13:14:05+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Spotted 2 new 4-runners. Like the redesign but the last one was still my favorite. It's funny because I have yet to see an ad for this new vehicle, it's like Toyota is very quietly releasing this one with little promo.

Ironically, I saw an ad for the Volvo C30 this weekend. I've always criticized Volvo for not marketing this vehicle whatsoever and I was told here on the boards that they were not going to advertise this (then new) model. Glad to see they gave in and started advertising this cool, funky little hatch :shades:"
41,2010-01-25T15:13:13+00:00,ateixeira,"Our cub scout troop leader got a new one of these.

Roomy little bugger. I swear it has more useful room than a Civic."
42,2010-01-25T15:20:05+00:00,lemko,...a couple of new Nissan Muranos. Strange-looking beasts!
43,2010-01-25T19:19:10+00:00,boomchek,I don't really care for the design that much when I see it in person.
44,2010-01-29T17:48:04+00:00,ghulet,"oh yeah, those Fits have an astonishing amount of interior space. Plus, unlike the majority of Hondas, you don't feel like you're sitting on the ground, or at least in a tunnel."
45,2010-01-29T17:55:45+00:00,ghulet,"....but what is the difference between a 550i Gran Turismo (for which I've seen many commercials) and an X6 (which I have seen in person--they's UGLY)? BMW has a really dizzying array (48 models, not counting those with transmission choices) available in North America right now, good Lord. I can't imagine dealers even keeping one of each (even just the 'good sellers') in stock. Then you count interior color and textile choices, stand-alone options, packages, wheel/tire combos....it's like GM in the '60s. I'd think for their own sanity, they'd reduce at least a little of the redundancy, or at least otherwise streamline a bit.
Funny, in 1988 there were like ten or so models available in NA, most of which offered very few options."
46,2010-01-29T18:50:16+00:00,ateixeira,"The 550i Gran Turismo is a 5 door hatchback version of the 5 series sedan. At least is adds utility to the equation.

The X6 is a ""coupe"" version of the X5, i.e. a low roof SAV with half the utility removed. BMW gives it more powerful engines to set it apart from the X5, but I'd rather have an X5 with the X6 engines."
47,2010-01-30T01:38:10+00:00,british_rover,"The Gran Turismo also sits higher then the regular five series, has a longer wheelbase and is actually built on the 7 series platform.

I hope it actually does sell well as it will hopefully encourage SAAB to build an affordable five door hatch that actually gets good mileage and doesn't sit on stilts."
48,2010-01-30T03:41:14+00:00,ghulet,".....it's highly unlikely that the U.S. would receive it, what with SAAB having sold all of seven-thousand-whatever units here last year."
49,2010-01-30T16:02:03+00:00,kyfdx,"Yeah... the 5-series GT is really a 7-series...

I've heard that all of the new 5-series will be moving up in scale, though.."
0,2010-01-30T22:03:32+00:00,ateixeira,"Watch, they'll base it off the new GT."
1,2010-01-31T15:31:01+00:00,kyfdx,"Definitely... in this age of fuel efficiency, I really don't get the bigger is better thing.."
2,2010-01-31T15:42:39+00:00,ghulet,"....though I guess if you can afford a vehicle that starts at $63k, fuel costs aren't an issue. But still, its garishness vis-a-vis the economy and at least looking like you're making an effort to be efficient, this vehicle is a bit much."
3,2010-01-31T16:29:02+00:00,kyfdx,"It's funny, though...

You'll hear all sorts of enthusiasts say, ""People that spend $35K+ for a luxury car don't worry about the extra cost for premium!"", but that is probably the #1 thing that keeps people away from the luxury imports.. Especially, potential Acura/Lexus buyers..

The vehicle could get 9 mpg, but it's the extra $0.25/gallon that they can't tolerate..."
4,2010-01-31T17:23:19+00:00,fintail,"Probably because CR makes such a big deal of it, and the sheeple just love to abide by those opinions."
5,2010-02-01T18:01:55+00:00,ateixeira,"It would be even worse for used or CPO luxury cars, because those buyers are on a tighter budget.

There is a psychological barrier.

We had a 1995 Mazda 626 that wanted premium, and so we used nothing but 93 octane, and proceeded to have fuel system problems in the 6th year of ownership. :sick:

That soured me on paying a premium for fuel that isn't necessarily better quality (only higher octane)."
6,2010-02-01T19:49:27+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new style Maserati Quattroporte today, with the ""Sport GTS"" badging. White, filthy, parked at a pet store. I can envision 90lb trophy wife with a yappy ankle biter dog driving it."

You mean like this?"
8,2010-02-01T20:13:52+00:00,ateixeira,"I've been seeing a lot of these lately, the new style. All over the place.

No runaway sudden acceleration cases among those."

11,2010-02-02T02:11:51+00:00,fintail,"Is that a good thing?

Today I saw a SRX"
12,2010-02-02T14:16:19+00:00,lemko,I've always gone to Pat's.
13,2010-02-02T16:19:54+00:00,ateixeira,"Pat's for me, too.

My brother visited from Brazil last summer, and driving back from NY to DC we stopped in Philly for 2 reasons:

* to see the Rocky statue
* Pat's cheesesteak ""wit"" onions

It was worth it."
14,2010-02-02T18:56:18+00:00,boomchek,The current redesign made the car more average looking. Really blends in with the traffic. Nothing special imo.
15,2010-02-02T19:02:59+00:00,fintail,I think it really resembles an Accord...and the current Accord isn't exactly a beauty queen.
16,2010-02-02T20:30:02+00:00,ateixeira,"Buyers disagree, though. Sales are up by leaps and bounds.

January was another strong month, Subaru was up 28% in the US.

Folks north of the border agree - Subaru of Canada had their best January ever.

And keep in mind supply is still limited, especially loaded models."
17,2010-02-02T20:48:51+00:00,fintail,"Making the cars bigger and blander looking is a sure way to help sales in the US, no doubt."
18,2010-02-02T21:00:47+00:00,boomchek,I know sales are up and that the general population likes maintsream cars more than specialty oddballs that us car enthusaists like. I always though the previous Legacy was the nicest one yet.
19,2010-02-03T15:30:02+00:00,ateixeira,"Me too, I loved the 2005 models. Gorgeous. Inside and out.

Keep in mind that when it came out, though, people screamed about it being boring and that it ""looked like a Camry"". I felt like I was the only one who liked it. Seriously.

Auto designs take a while to grow on people.

Got the detailed breakdown: Legacy up 110% in January, Outback up 117%! :surprise:

PS Canucks love it even more, Outback up by 382.9 percent!"
20,2010-02-03T16:58:07+00:00,bumpy,"Front end looked like a squarish interepretation of a VW nose, and the rest was straight Generic CUV. Nobody would know who made it without the GMC badge."
21,2010-02-03T21:36:55+00:00,ateixeira,"They're very ""blocky"" looking. I much prefer the Equinox for styling.

Saw a 'nox at the DC Auto Show that stickered for $38 grand. If that doesn't shock you, the fact that it was FWD might. :surprise:"
22,2010-02-03T21:51:29+00:00,bumpy,They have to repay the Feddies somehow...
23,2010-02-04T22:54:50+00:00,british_rover,"Just a sudden case of the uglies.
That new RX is one of the worst looking vehicles on the market. Not that any of the Lexus models are beauty queens but the RX has to be close to the worst."
24,2010-02-04T23:36:00+00:00,texases,I agree on the RX - I was amazed how they made it blocky/stumply looking. Not that it was a looker before but now? :sick:
25,2010-02-04T23:50:14+00:00,boomchek,"I agree too. The first gen RX was stylish, the 2nd generation too I think. But this one has styling lines just for the sake of having styling lines.

But the Lexus ugly duckling that takes the cake has gotta be their new HS. Also has angles and lines that don't necessarily go together but are just there for no reason.

They look even worse in person. Like an uglified first generation Prius."
26,2010-02-04T23:51:42+00:00,british_rover,"The first generation model wasn't too bad looking and they aged well. I think they still look pretty good now.

I have to wonder what Toyota is feeding their designers. Nothing they have designed in the last what six or seven years is remotely attractive at all.

If the car isn't attractive, or fun to drive and it might suddenly accelerate or not stop and wreck itself then why do you buy it? Good gas mileage isn't a good enough reason."
27,2010-02-04T23:56:47+00:00,texases,"""I have to wonder what Toyota is feeding their designers.""

Same chow they're having over at the Acura shop, I'm afraid!"
28,2010-02-05T02:15:49+00:00,fintail,"Cars for people who hate cars.

At least they made them easy to spot, with the reflectors low on the bumper...so you can see them from a distance at night as they are LLCing/merging onto a highway at 30mph/going half the yellow sign limit on an off ramp.

There does seem to be an ""ugly war"" between Lexus and Acura, too."
29,2010-02-05T13:15:32+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Are you combining Lexus in with that? I have to disagree with you, I think the IS line is sharp and in the realm of ultra-luxury sedans the LS is pretty classy looking IMO as well. As for Toyota themselves, it's not supposed to be gorgeous but I find the Tacoma to be the best and most rugged looking of the compact class and RAV is pretty sharp for a sport ute.

Now this is only a small fraction of their product lineup but I don't think their designers are all clueless."
30,2010-02-06T22:22:57+00:00,ateixeira,"Lexus may be bland, but not ugly.

Acura trade marked that.

I will say that Acura interiors are among my favorites, though.

Just went to the DC Auto Show and I hated how BMW's dash protrudes out towards the front passenger. The dash is close to the knees and made me feel claustrophic, even in bigger cars.

Contrast that with Acuras, which have a more cockpit like design that swoops away from your knees and adds room.

Lexus has nice interiors, too. I think they have to do that - to differentiate from the Toyotas they're often based on."
31,2010-02-08T13:29:40+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Checked out the latest Acura at the dealer over the weekend and I thought it was pretty cool looking. The wheels are on the small side which look kinda disproportionate but I dig the profile myself.

The interior is a knockout.

I'd drive it. :shades:"
32,2010-02-08T15:08:37+00:00,british_rover,"The IS is about the only ok looking model Lexus or Toyota puts out now. That it looks ok don't overshadow that it just isn't a very good car. The IS250 is way underpowered with no torque and you can't get AWD on the IS350 that has good power because the AWD system will get toasted AFIK. Then if you do get AWD the front driveshaft takes away the driver's leg room because there is a hump in the transmission tunnel and the driver's side floor for that shaft. Your right leg rests right on it and it hums at speed. You can't see out the back at all and the back is cramped. You get a lot of technology for the price though if you are into the gadget factory. Me I would rather have a competent car and less gadgets.

I guess the Tacoma looks good too but the look of a truck never really mattered to me and the hilux is just so much better then the Tacoma in every way that I just sort of forget about the Tacoma. Plus the Tacoma is way, way too big like all other compact trucks now."
33,2010-02-08T18:03:43+00:00,stickguy,"Oh yeah, I test drove an IS when they first came out (maybe just test sit) and that hump was a deal breaker. Horrible, horrible design.

The ZDX should be taken off the market. It is too dangerous. Why you may ask? Well, only slightly kidding, but the back door is going to poke an eye out (""you'll shoot your eye out kid!"")

the top edge comes to a very sharp point. Hit me right in the chest, and my daughter right in the face. And the door (and that spike) is pretty long, so the odds of running into it are pretty high!

Just IMO one of thos style over function issues that come to light in real world usage. Like the 1/4 views on an FJ cruiser."
34,2010-02-08T22:56:13+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw one on the road, and it does not look better out in the real world. Frightening, actually, I quickly told the kids to close their eyes.

Even my wife said she hated the black stripe on the back (it's a tinted window) and asked if hatchbacks were making a comeback."
35,2010-02-08T23:32:59+00:00,fintail,"Saw my first SHO badged new Taurus today.

Haven't seen a ZDX yet, maybe it will flop. Then again, the hideous BMW X6 seems to be popular enough in the money-but-no-class-or-taste set, so that might bode well for Acura."
36,2010-02-09T00:00:48+00:00,andys120,I don't think I've seen more than two X6s in a year--even in Scottsdale where every other Desperate Housewife drives a big SUV or Crossover..
37,2010-02-09T01:58:39+00:00,fintail,"It took about a year for them to get going here, but if I drive around enough, I see them almost daily here now. I do live in an area with way too many trophy/Stepford wives, that has to be part of it."
38,2010-02-09T02:12:00+00:00,british_rover,I have been seeing a couple X6s here and there now. I think BMW might just be the next Toyota unless they learn from Toyota's and GM's mistakes that is.
39,2010-02-09T03:00:28+00:00,fintail,"BMW certainly is getting to a point where it all might be too much. Every little segment, with so much debatable styling...but their quality seems to be holding up.

I hope MB had its problems in the last decade and can move on now."
40,2010-02-09T21:10:24+00:00,boomchek,"Unusual for Vancouver at this time of the year to see exotic cars on the road but we had some mild weather and plus crowds of people in downtown for the 2010 Olympics = guys showing off their toys.

In a 5 minute span in downtown saw a Ferrari F430 spider in light blue color driving with the top down, a Nissan GTR painted flat black, and my first one on the road:

A black SLR McLaren roadster, driven by an older dude. From far away I thought it was an SLK until it got close. Cool cause it's gotta be one of a handful in Canada, maybe the only one in Vancouver?"
41,2010-02-09T22:54:42+00:00,fintail,"I got beside a F430 Spider yesterday a couple blocks from home, yesterday. Red, maybe late 50s driver...crawled along IMO looking to be seen....but the crossovers and minivans around him couldn't have cared less. It sounded nice, anyway.

Crapload of new E-class at the dealer yesterday , maybe 20 of them sitting there now. They do seem to be selling, I see them all the time. The brown one I spotted there some time ago was not in the lineup...someone must have bought it. Local airport Hertz is renting them out in their prestige group, too."
42,2010-02-11T13:28:41+00:00,ateixeira,Top down? What are the temps?
43,2010-02-11T14:37:10+00:00,fintail,Probably in the mid-upper 50s F when he saw it. El Nino has been strong this year. Some of the Harley posers are already back on the road here...teriffic...
44,2010-02-11T22:56:38+00:00,boomchek,8-10 degrees C (yeah in the 50s as Fintail said).
45,2010-02-12T00:44:58+00:00,ghulet,"I saw my second BMW X6 today, it looked much better in this color (Burgandy/light tan interior) than the first one, but it's still ugly.

I also saw my first Mitsubishi Lancer Sportback (I think that's what it's called) in that bright blue that all the lil sport hatches have been wearing the last ten years or so. Nice looking enough car, though."
46,2010-02-12T18:47:30+00:00,ateixeira,The concept looked even better.
47,2010-02-14T23:46:18+00:00,lemko,...a shimmery lime green Hyundai Genesis coupe at Willow Grove Mall yesterday afternoon while doing some rush Valentine's Day shopping since the recent blizzards have kept me indoors for quite a spell. I didn't think I'd see my Mercury Grand Marquis until April when I looked out on my street Thursday morning.
48,2010-02-14T23:57:40+00:00,fintail,New style A4 showed up in the garage of my building today.
49,2010-02-16T23:44:04+00:00,lvranger,"Saw a new 4Runner the other day. It looked like it was trying too hard to look off road ready. Don't they have the FJ for that? It made me miss my Land Cruiser, which looks much better and has more off road prowess."
0,2010-02-17T17:56:30+00:00,ateixeira,"Starting to see a lot of these. Saw a couple today, then a Lexus GS, and noticed that from the rear view, there is a resemblance."
1,2010-02-18T00:49:42+00:00,kyfdx,"Audi A5
Audi A4
Hyundai Genesis Coupe
Jaguar XK coupe.."
2,2010-02-18T17:52:47+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a Genesis coupe also.

I gotta say, it has grown on me. That dog-legged rear window definitely stands out.

I wonder if the lightning-bolt on the Odyssey will grow on me, as well? Right now I find it awkward."
3,2010-02-19T13:10:55+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Followed a brand new Sonata home on the highway. Dealer plates and everything.

Impressions? It looks pretty good from the back, lots of detail. The side profile, meh,but in the rear view the nose on it is a mess. It looks like a Zamboni with stretched eyes and a large grill. Now, this was a lower trim model with a single exhaust and base wheels (no hubcaps) so maybe a V6 model will look a little more agressive with bigger wheels and duallys out back.

Overall though it is actually a small car, more inline with the first generation Mazda 6 than a late model Accord or Taurus. It wasn't as striking as I expected it to be."
4,2010-02-19T14:53:14+00:00,qbrozen,"Followed a brand new Sonata home on the highway.

You followed it home? Did it ask its mommy if it could keep you? :P"
5,2010-02-19T15:27:48+00:00,anythngbutgm,LOL!
6,2010-02-19T15:45:11+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw some pics of a loaded up V6 that was lowered a bit and had big rims. It looked SOOOOO much better.

It has that coupe-like silhouette so big wheel gaps (i.e. base models) sort of spoil the whole look."
7,2010-02-19T15:50:47+00:00,british_rover,I didn't think the Sonata was getting a V6 for the new version. Something about DI Turbo 4s instead.
8,2010-02-19T16:36:58+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, I think that's right, no V6 in the new model."
9,2010-02-19T16:41:54+00:00,anythngbutgm,"No V6, I just meant a higher trim level with bigger wheels and foglights and other exterior sporty touches might be beneficial to the looks."
10,2010-02-19T17:26:58+00:00,ateixeira,"Found that pic I mentioned, looks much better lowered and with rims that fill up those wheel wells:



That's customized but Hyundai should consider offering a Sport model that's similar."
11,2010-02-19T17:36:06+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Oooo, now that works. Much better."
12,2010-02-19T17:43:38+00:00,fintail,"Are those wheels on some kind of camber kit, or is it a photochop job? Something just doesn't look right. Either way, that thing would ride way too rough for the average beige Sonata/Camcord buyer. That one also seems to have sprouted some weird fender bling.

Do those actually have a pano roof option, or it just faux-painted?

This is more along the lines of what a nicely equipped Sonata will resemble:"
13,2010-02-19T17:53:12+00:00,ateixeira,"Ah, yes, Americanized. Big wheel gaps, tacky faux chrome grille.

Hyundai should take photos from a top angle, they look better than this ground level shot.

Not sure about the roof, I just saw the image somewhere else and felt like sharing."
14,2010-02-19T18:04:34+00:00,qbrozen,"yikes!
Looks like a Chinese knockoff of a Korean knockoff of a German car."
15,2010-02-19T18:10:05+00:00,fintail,"I suspect the body color grille and black roof treatment are custom and unavailable from the manufacturer. I think this new Sonata will be something that is interesting from some angles...and not so much from others. It's an odd design. But, a lot more engaging than the current wannabe- 2003 Accord style.

White is very trendy on highline cars in the past few years, especially with black roof, especially on MB and BMW."
16,2010-02-19T18:18:52+00:00,ateixeira,"That one-off was probably mimicking the M3 coupe, which has a neat carbon fiber roof. They should have painted that effect while they were at it."
17,2010-02-20T20:33:41+00:00,fintail,"I've seen the new M3 with that black and white theme too...the one in my apartment parking garage is that scheme. Also seen on pano roof E-class from 2003-onwards, pano roof W204 C-class, custom W221 S class and CLS, 6ers, probably on other BMWs too.

Fake carbon fiber paint might actually be worse than fake pano roof look...hard to tell."
18,2010-02-20T20:35:25+00:00,fintail,"Yesterday evening - Audi Q5, new E-class coupe already dirty and not looking cared for, Panamera with dealer plates, this morning spotted an Alfa 8C eastbound on I90."
19,2010-02-20T20:41:29+00:00,boomchek,"8C; that's a rare sighting, especially at ths time of the year!!"
20,2010-02-20T20:43:25+00:00,fintail,"I had to do a double take...it was black. Awesome day for a drive in that thing.

I know there's another one in the area too, darkish red."
21,2010-02-20T23:13:39+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a Q5 yesterday, parked in front of my house (not mine).

Do they share a platform with the Tiguan?"
22,2010-02-20T23:56:06+00:00,fintail,I don't think they do...A5 seems to look like it is one size up.
23,2010-02-21T13:01:52+00:00,ateixeira,"A5? Was that a typo? I meant Q5, the little crossover."
24,2010-02-21T16:59:01+00:00,fintail,"Yep, typo :blush:"
25,2010-02-23T02:41:24+00:00,fintail,Spotted one of the Lincoln big butt Ford Flex things today.
26,2010-03-04T13:22:28+00:00,anythngbutgm,"3 new 4runners on my way into work, two Limiteds and a bare bones looking Sport model with flat black wheels. The one Limited I saw in a dark Carbon gray looked really sharp. My only beef with the new model is the minimal rear bumper protection which looks like a fender bender could be costly."
27,2010-03-04T17:39:16+00:00,ateixeira,"Temp tags and all. Silver.

I didn't notice before, but the chrome door strip extends all the way forward, splitting the hood from the front fender. Interesting and unique styling cue."
28,2010-03-04T18:33:20+00:00,boomchek,Never seen those on the road yet.
29,2010-03-04T18:40:32+00:00,fintail,"There were 3 of them hanging around the local dealer the other day. Odd design.

I'm seeing the new W212 E pretty often now, not a remarkable sighting anymore...they must be selling."
30,2010-03-04T18:41:51+00:00,boomchek,I see more coupes than sedans of the W212.
31,2010-03-04T18:43:18+00:00,fintail,I see mainly lesser-trimmed sedans (no LEDs). I have seen a few coupes though. At the local dealer sedans outnumber coupes probably 3 or 4:1.
32,2010-03-04T18:53:54+00:00,british_rover,"There is actually an economic observation that sedans typically sell better then coupes in a recession or bad economic times.

Similar to how skirts get longer in bad economic times and shorter the hotter the economy is going.

It is called the hemline index for skirts.

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/weekinreview/19lewin.html"
33,2010-03-04T19:08:42+00:00,lemko,"It's probably because people become more conservative and cautious when times are tough. A flashy sports car seems frivolous in light of today's economic climate. When I see everybody driving minivans, I'll know the economy's in the toilet."
34,2010-03-04T20:18:15+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, when the going gets tough, conspicuous consumption becomes undesireable...hasn't seemed to stop the local Bentley/Lamborghini/faux Tuscan villa McMansion set though :lemon:"
35,2010-03-06T00:14:55+00:00,lemko,...somebody at the end of the block on the next street over just bought a new silver Buick LaCrosse CXL. Better not let the wife see or she'll be wanting one too!
36,2010-03-08T18:12:11+00:00,ateixeira,"Is there a ""Most Improved"" award? It would win it."
37,2010-03-08T18:52:30+00:00,lemko,"The new LaCrosse makes her 2005 look downright OLD. Then again, the 2005 LaCrosse was a vast improvement over the 2004 Century."
38,2010-03-08T19:05:12+00:00,qbrozen,"Saw my first ISF .... well, at least that I noticed. I approached it from behind on the highway. I'm not really sure what tipped me off, but when I looked down and saw the quad tailpipes, I knew. It is a shame the owner drives it like a broken schoolbus in the left lane."
39,2010-03-08T19:06:35+00:00,ateixeira,"I think this actually looks worse in person, out on the roads.

Like a bloated, pregnant Accord."
40,2010-03-08T19:11:02+00:00,fintail,"I saw a few ZDX at the local dealer yesterday. Same disease, different patient.

I also saw a one-tone Audi R8...that on the other hand, I'd be more than happy to drive."
41,2010-03-08T19:17:06+00:00,british_rover,"They actually have a 2010 G550 on the showroom floor for 110,000 dollars. I thought those were now special custom order only. Who in their right mind would order one for stock?

Someone must have ordered it then backed out."
42,2010-03-08T19:34:58+00:00,fintail,"I can't remember the last time I saw a G at the local dealer...those things seem really 2004 these days.

That dealer is going to be stuck unless someone with way too much money and not enough taste or sense comes along. Lucky for him, those do seem to exist together all too often."
43,2010-03-08T20:41:43+00:00,british_rover,I wish I had looked at the build date on that car when I was there but forgot too. I might have a chance to check it when I go back to pick up the E-Class.
44,2010-03-08T20:55:43+00:00,fintail,"Good point, it might not exactly be new, unless it really was a custom build car. I doubt there's much demand for those things now outside of the Arabian peninsula.

There was a loaded brown W212 E-class hanging around my local MB dealer not long ago...I have to believe it was a special order too, but it is gone now, so someone must have wanted it. The W212 E63 is also now sitting outside with the normal cars...maybe they'd give me a deal on it :shades:"
45,2010-03-08T21:19:03+00:00,ateixeira,"I like the R8's carbon fiber panel, it distinguishes the whole car."
46,2010-03-08T22:34:50+00:00,kyfdx,"Accelerating away from a light,at full V-8 howl...

Don't love these... but, sounded pretty nice!"
47,2010-03-08T22:50:14+00:00,texases,What's not to like about the sound of a Ferrari Maserati?
48,2010-03-09T00:08:06+00:00,kyfdx,"Not quite Ferrari-quality sound..

To me, Maserati is an Italian Jaguar.."
49,2010-03-09T02:16:27+00:00,texases,"I'm sure they tune it differently, but those Maseratis use a Ferrari-based engine..."
0,2010-03-09T13:15:04+00:00,lemko,...dark red metallic Chevrolet Traverse in the parking lot of a bank on Rhawn Street in NE Philly.
1,2010-03-09T13:33:14+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Ya, for the longest time I thought Astons had the best wail but the Maserati coupe I heard at full bore in downtown Boston was heavenly."
2,2010-03-09T15:48:50+00:00,ateixeira,"A friend of mine bought one. Interesting looking vehicle, like a super-sized mini Cooper. It's big but it seems so low to the ground.

He's a Ford guy. Had 2 Freestars. Traded one for an Explorer, now he's got a Flex as well.

I like it, kind unique looking in a sea of look-alike crossovers."
3,2010-03-09T19:05:03+00:00,boomchek,"We have a used Flex on our lot. It's fairly roomy inside but I'm not into its styling.

For these type of crossovers I still prefer the Pacifica which I thought was ahead of its time."
4,2010-03-09T19:45:30+00:00,qbrozen,"We really liked our Pac from a fit/finish and function aspect. The drivetrain is what really help it back, though, IMHO. The 3.5 was adequate, but the antiquated 4-speed auto was horrendous. It would have been worlds better if they mated it to the Benz 5-speed. It would have helped greatly with mileage, too, which was pretty darned bad (18 mpg mixed for us compared to 21 in each our Pilot and XC90)."
5,2010-03-09T19:53:27+00:00,texases,"The Flex has gotten lots of good press, including Inside Line naming it one of their top 5 favorite long term vehicles. That, from a bunch of performance car nuts!"
6,2010-03-09T21:01:59+00:00,ateixeira,"You don't have to convince me that a big, comfortable car is great for trips. I love my Sienna for what it is."
7,2010-03-11T19:02:51+00:00,anythngbutgm,Brand new Sonata in Black. Looks good in that color. :shades:
8,2010-03-11T23:27:00+00:00,texases,"I tried out sitting in the new Sonata at the recent Dallas auto show. Disappointment, the 4dr coupe styling includes a very low roof opening, almost at my (unusually high) eye-level. Nope! I did like the Mustang, very good view all around, I may have to test one with the new v6. Major disappointment: No BMW...No Infiniti... :confuse: I was wanting to see that GT in the metal, along with (maybe) the new M37 and (not likely) 535i. Wonder why they dropped it?"
9,2010-03-12T19:03:41+00:00,fintail,"Maybe not brand new, but a Bentley Continental convertible has shown up in the parking garage at work...maybe that bodes well for this year's raises :shades:"
10,2010-03-12T19:11:41+00:00,boomchek,"Nice. Maybe they froze your raises to fund the big boss's raise, hence the Conti cabrio. :P"
11,2010-03-12T21:21:27+00:00,ateixeira,I wouldn't get my hopes up!
12,2010-03-12T21:45:51+00:00,fintail,"They did that last year...that's probably why the Bentley is here :shades: :sick:

Although maybe having the courage to park such an ostentatious thing among more pedestrian vehicles might mean everyone else might not feel bad soon...trying to remain positive..."
13,2010-03-13T20:19:51+00:00,ghulet,".....a half block north of our house, a brand-new Mercedes E350 4Matic (IL vanity plate ""PRADA""), I swear to God. Anywho, a car of this caliber is HIGHLY unusual in our neighborhood. Wasn't there long, shocking. Maybe a real estate agent?"
14,2010-03-14T02:20:34+00:00,fintail,"Realtor or a vendor of knock-off designer goods, maybe.

Anyone with a plate like that should be kicked in the head a few times until their brain starts functioning again."
15,2010-03-15T15:58:50+00:00,ateixeira,"I know these aren't all the new any more, but I think I've seen a dozen of these in the past day or two. Swarms of 'em.

Also saw a new Insight on the highway, a rare sighting."

17,2010-03-15T20:07:37+00:00,stever,First Boise sighting.
18,2010-03-16T14:08:52+00:00,anythngbutgm,"BMW's galore... Lotsa Mercedes GLK's, Audi Q5's and BMW X3's. The whole area in general was very import dominated.

Oddest sighting was a brand spaking new Maserati Coupe' parked outside the Billygoat Tavern tunnel which tells me even the rich guys enjoy a good greasy triple cheeseburger... :P

Wonder if the river is still green since I left :shades:"
19,2010-03-16T16:42:47+00:00,stickguy,See them everywhere by me. The company that manages the office park where I work has a bunch running around as the maitenance fleet. Much more efficient than a bunch of Econolines.
20,2010-03-16T17:03:23+00:00,ateixeira,"That's not a typo, I work near Embassy Row so I'm sure it was a european import (diplomatic tags).

I wonder if instead of trying to sell a FWD 0-series in the USA, wouldn't BMW be better off selling the 118i instead?"
21,2010-03-16T17:30:10+00:00,fintail,A young woman who lives in my building just bought a Tiguan. I saw her park it....or try to park it...comical...she's not fit to park a bicycle.
22,2010-03-16T17:46:37+00:00,ateixeira,"Also, a friend of mine's dad totalled his car and just replaced it with a shiny new Legacy sedan. He got a pearl white color that is arguably the best looking color on that car."
23,2010-03-16T17:56:16+00:00,boomchek,"Speaking of rich people enjoying inexpensive stuff, I saw a new Jag XF at a local Walmart. A well dressed family with kids doing lots of shopping. Heck I'd do the same even if I had lots of dough. Isn't that how people get rich, by being frugal?"

25,2010-03-17T02:06:16+00:00,stever,"It hit 68 today and we went down to a pizza joint around 6 pm. It's on a busy corner and there was lots of commuter traffic. Passed a Plymouth Prowler on the way there.

Lots of convertibles out, and just a lot of SUVs, sedans and pickups. Most were just ordinary cars and they really weren't all that attractive just cruising down the road.

Anyway, it's not strictly new, but it's a rare bird around here - spotted a Ferrari.

Beats me which one though - At first I thought it was an F430 because there was a hump near the rear. But I didn't notice any streamlined bodywork behind the seats. The badge was on the rear quarter panel instead of on the front fender, if that means anything."
26,2010-03-17T02:47:55+00:00,fintail,"The Ferrari crest was on the rear panel?

Hmmm...that doesn't ring a bell to me. Maybe one of the late 550 Spiders?"
27,2010-03-17T02:53:18+00:00,stever,"Yeah, behind the driver a ways, and before the rear wheel. It was a convertible if that helps.

It almost looked like some kind of air intake on the rear ""trunk"" lid - the hump wasn't all the way at the rear end. Maybe the guy had stuck a little luggage rack on there.

I don't think it was a fire engine red Audi TT with some Ferrari badging. :-)"
28,2010-03-17T03:51:04+00:00,fintail,Doesn't sound like a 550 then...did it have a spoiler? And not a 360/430...I'm stumped.
29,2010-03-17T04:23:46+00:00,stever,"No spoiler.

I should have posted this over Mystery car pix.... - the invisible one."

28,2010-03-29T19:48:23+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Yes, but the same could be said of all makers out there.

Check out the new Sonata for instance. You would think the lines and creases are for improving drag, which it does, coming in at a slippery .28 CoD (an improvement over the .30 of the 2010 model).

What's humerous is that is the exact same figure as the current generation Camry. The Camry hybrid rings in at .27.

Even more humerous, Toyota models in general are some of the slippperiest out there, model for model. While that doesn't necessarily transfer over in the looks dept. at least there is a function behind it.

FWIW, some Toyotas I find attractive are the Tacoma, Venza, 4runner, LC, Camry SE and the new Sienna."
29,2010-03-29T21:56:18+00:00,fintail,"I still can't get over the Camry's nose. And I think the Prius is dorky, but it isn't pretending to be anything else, and I do respect honesty.

Yeah I don't mind the Venza either...not the segment I'm looking to drive right now, but I would take it over its RX sibling. It's pretty smooth looking.

Regarding the drag coefficient talk, I remain amused that the angular and somewhat boxy MB W212 E-class has a Cd of 0.25...one would never guess by looking at it."

35,2010-03-30T12:33:29+00:00,vcheng,"The ""pig snout"" syndrome is partly the result of mainly european standards for protecting pedestrians in a crash. This also means that the rakish BMW profile is also turning more upright with higher hoods and bigger grills. There is a similar issue with new side crash standards causing higher beltlines and ""sitting in a foxhole"" sightlines.

Of course I agree with the comments that at least the designs can be more pleasing to the eye even with the new regulations."

Also, car designers in recent times are really just not very useful...I don't see how many of them actually work, so many just repeat the same old themes and styles. And the detail that irks me most are oversized or exaggerated front lights. IMO it's the laziest design.

Whatever happened to graceful design that ages well?"
42,2010-03-30T17:46:20+00:00,fintail,"That could be it...I have always believed something was lost when computers took over design. I don't see much timeless design being made today.

Panamera has quite a rump indeed...it is shocking as you really don't realize it until you look directly at it from the rear...then BOOM! Such cars are lucky they have performance to help distract from the looks. A 4-door 911 it really isn't."
43,2010-03-30T17:59:53+00:00,vcheng,"Well, there are some designs out there today that I find a bit more palatable.

The 911 is still good, but that's because Porsche has the best engineers but the laziest designers so they haven't found the energy to f- it up too much except the fried egg headlights from a few years ago.

The newer MB designs are good for the marque I think, except the GLK being too blocky, as well as Aston Martin, except for the goofy counter-rotating tach needles.

Audi has promise, execept for the wavy LED lines they follow inside their headlights. The Mini is a good design. The Suzuki Kizashi is reasonable but much of the remaining Asian marques are mainly derivative designs. The newer BMW sedans are better than the recent disasters, but they still have a long way to go before they catch up to their previous graceful designs.

Don't get me started on engineering aspects though. :mad: Why have the cars so difficult to service and maintain these days? I suspect it is entirely intentional.

I could find a few more cars but it is much harder than it was some years ago, that's for sure."
44,2010-03-30T20:09:38+00:00,fintail,"Porsche could have detailed it a little better to look less bloated. IMO the Aston Rapide pulls off the big low supersedan much better. Although for me, all of that isn't necessary. I'll be more than happy with a big tank S-class and a big AMG-tuned engine. I don't need to look sporty, I just want fast :shades:

The GLK looks like a Tonka toy to me. The E isn't bad, but there's a hint of Acura in it. It does appear to be a sales success though, so whatever works....MB still has some work to do to shed the lowered quality image. I do think the new 5er and 7er are improvements, X6 an 5GT hurt my eyes though.

No automaker wants to build something with an infinite lifespan. Everything being dependent on relatively delicate computers should take care of that."
45,2010-03-30T21:23:16+00:00,boomchek,"Maybe more vehicles have sculpted sides (aka flame surfacing) but otherwise I don't see any direct copies of BMW designs.

And I still don't like the looks of the BMW Z4. It may be a nice car to drive and bring the ooohs and aaahs because it's a BMW but I don't think it's a well done design. It looks like a clown shoe to me.

Audi does have very elegant designs, especially the A6 and A8. The A4 is not bad but changes from generation to generation appear to be very minimal.

As for MB, I never liked the current ML as I think it's overstyled with all the creases and angles (looks like something Kia or Hyundai would have designed 5 years ago), and I don't like the GLK either. Too boxy with odd proportions.

Acura - yeah, the whole lineup looks like a fail in styling excercise."
46,2010-03-30T22:08:16+00:00,fintail,"MB has gained a kind of side swoop, especially evolving since the W203 and W211. It's not as severe as a Z4 or something though, thankfully. ML tries very hard to be butch.

Audi hasn't changed much in the past 15 years or so, save for the gaping grille and a few new models. They have a theme now in their greenhouse design, and it will last for the foreseeable future. Just like MB and BMW."
47,2010-03-30T22:28:00+00:00,fezo,"I will say that in black the pignose (or vacuum cleaner) effect is largely muted. The grill is black as well which helps.

Once it suddenly accelerates into something that'll flatten it right out."

1,2010-03-31T12:33:30+00:00,stickguy,"last time I drove one was back in about 2005 (it was a loaner while my tC was being worked on). Brand new, with like 20 miles on it.

I could not for the life of my figure out why anyone would buy one. Interior was cheesey, and the ride was downright scary being so floating. And the steering was like spinning the wheel on one of those arcade driving games.

I do remember that it was amazingly quiet. So I guess if that is all that matters to you, go for it.

'I also believe that a large percentage of the population knows nothing and cares less about cars, and have no clue what actual driving control is. They just want cheap an reliable (unless they have more money, in which case they want a snobby brand name).

You are exactly right. I learned to drive in the 60s, and back then almost anyone would interpret any feedback as 'fighting the steering' and carefully avoid it.

Speaking of slope-backs I saw a Panamera at a dealer some time ago and rather liked it. It looked dramatic, fast and very much like a Porsche, something I can't say about the Cayenne.

The MKS looks much better and was open. Very plush inside. Black on black, so it was a bit dark and dreary. Huge inside, acres of room. Very plush and comfy, double-stitched leather, padded surfaces, fabric wrapped pillars, the works.

14,2010-04-01T16:15:10+00:00,ateixeira,I thought it would last a bit longer than that.
15,2010-04-03T15:35:17+00:00,stickguy,but I like it way better than the sedan!
16,2010-04-04T00:29:22+00:00,3233,"Plenty of new E Classes rolling around in my area. I like how Mercedes seems to have avoided the super-high trunk/belt line that plagues Lexus (I'm sure you've seen the gawdawful-looking HS250 and the ""I hope there's nothing behind me"" IS).

Saw some new Terrains, Equinoxes and SRX's too. The Terrain's back end could be 10 years old, the Equinox looks like a Saturn, and the SRX actually looks decent, to be blunt.

And then there's the guy who apparently owns a Murcielago as a daily driver who goes past me every day. He downshifts and guns it too, just to rub it in my face :mad:"
17,2010-04-04T04:00:20+00:00,fintail,There's an older [non-permissible content removed] in a newer Quattroporte with a tuned exhaust who likes to taunt me by downshifting on the hill where I live... show offs
18,2010-04-04T05:56:45+00:00,boomchek,"Bunch of new rides:

-New 5 series BMW - much better looking than the outgoing model.

-Accord Crosstour - oh my what an odd looking thing. For $42k CDN I'll take an Audio A4 Avant thank you very much,

-Acuras - (and Hondas) - very disappointed in their curret lineup. I officially dislike the plastic silver Acura beaks; I wonder how they'll look when the silver color chips off after a few years.

All of the Acuras and Lexuses (oddly no Infiniti or Nissan at the show) are priced well in the german car territory but in my opinion don't offer the same heritage, dynamics, or engineering. Their allure 10 years ago was that you got similiar performance at a great discount. Now I see no incentive of buying one over a german counterpart.

Rolls Royce Drophead convertible - what ahuge car!
Aston Martin Rapide - very nice proportions.
Ferrari California - the retractable hard top has roof and trunk lines similiar to the Lexus SC.
Porsche Panamera - I like it a lot. Super comfy inside!
New Jag XJ - much nicer in reality than in pictures. Has lots of presence.

MB had their SLS at the show. Very nice!

Highlight of the show: A local exotic car tuner called SR Auto Group had a client's SLR 722 S that they modified, and another client's Lambo Reventon - #3 out of 20 in the world! That's in addition to a modified Aston and a LP640. Wow, I never knew Vancouver has these exotics around!

19,2010-04-04T18:56:42+00:00,fintail,"I think I got a pic of the Jag, I will have to look. It's a huge departure from the painfully slow evolution of previous models. Time will tell if the Jag customer embraces that or runs away.

I am still shocked at how insanely high new car prices are in Canada, with the respective dollars being virtually at par.

Some other new ones (to me) at that show: MB E-class cabrio, German Buick Regal, new style A8, a couple of Fiestas, Cruze"
20,2010-04-05T02:03:52+00:00,fintail,"Here's the Jag, in case anyone cares:





The SLS there didn't make me swoon, as I got to see it at the source:"
21,2010-04-05T13:26:21+00:00,ateixeira,So awkward looking.
22,2010-04-05T20:15:26+00:00,boomchek,Thanks for meeting up at the show and for the brochures and the magazines Fintail. I had a look through some of them yesterday and enjoyed them!
23,2010-04-05T20:25:48+00:00,fintail,"No problem, I knew you'd appreciate them, beats most of that stuff ending up in a recycle bin.

Oh yeah, I was emptying my trunk yesterday and found I forgot to give you something - that calendar. I'll hold onto it for next time, it'll probably be a minor collectible in time."
24,2010-04-05T20:31:10+00:00,boomchek,"Ok, no problem! Thanks!"
25,2010-04-05T20:33:49+00:00,qbrozen,"Of note:
2011 volvo S60. Not as dramatic in person. Also, very disappointed in the back seat space. Less than my '01 V70.

Fiat 500. SO SMALL. But still cool looking. Too bad nobody was allowed within 15 feet of it.

Fiesta. Actually allowed in it this year. Again, back seat too small.

Mazda2. Couldn't get in and all the windows were blacked out so you couldn't see inside. I got close to one and could see it had an interior. Maybe it was prepro and not up to scrutiny?

Nissan Juke. I really really like the looks of this. Again, a hands off display. I'm tall enough I could peek in and saw it was a right-hand drive model.

Mini Countryman. You could get right up and touch and walk around this (they had 2), but they were locked. This seems like a very good-sized vehicle. Looks to seat 4 comfortably.

As to the Mazda2 and Fiesta ... one of these days, a manufacturer has to come up with a subcompact where human adults could actually occupy the back seat. As it is, anyone who is over 6 foot and has kids (which, believe it or not, is about half the guys I know) has no chance in hell of ever being able to use one of these cars on a daily basis. It is a shame."
26,2010-04-05T20:36:51+00:00,ateixeira,"I think the benchmark for back seat space should be the old, original Scion xB.

Amazing back seat room. Incredible, really. I sat in that, and then a Lexus LS, back-to-back, and I swear the Scion was roomier.

PS You like the Juke? Seriously? :P"
27,2010-04-05T20:39:38+00:00,texases,"I wish I could get the headroom of an xB in any, repeat, any regular car"
28,2010-04-05T20:45:19+00:00,qbrozen,"agree on the xB.

yeah, i dig the juke. it borrows a bit from the FX/EX, which I also like. And a small, low sport ute (like the countryman and juke) makes sense to me."
29,2010-04-05T23:45:48+00:00,ateixeira,"The idea, yes.

The execution is a mess, though. Way too many gills/fangs/accessories."
30,2010-04-10T04:01:26+00:00,stickguy,"kid down the block has a brand new GTI. he was driving a couple of gen old 2.0 GTI. No idea where the $$ came from (or the insurance),since he is 19 and I am not quite sure if he actually graduated with my son (they were in the same class). He is kicking around at some menial job I believe, and if his parents gave him this, they are insane (and I don't think they have that kind of money, unless it is from the college fund he doesn't seem likely to ever need!).

Dark gray. I love it myself, but would want the 4 door.

The other one? A graphicguy mobile. Girl across the street (actual college grad with a job) seems to have traded in her prior gen (probably a 2008) TSX for a new TL. Dark Blue (almost like my 2000 TL, but maybe a touch darker) with gray leather.

Shockingly, I find it to be very good looking. Even the beak isn't too bad in that color combo. Not sure if it is just seeing it up close more, or the color which I love, but dang it is pretty sharp.

pretty sure it is just the base car. Did not peer inside to see if it has tech package."
31,2010-04-10T12:27:05+00:00,ateixeira,A body color grille would go a long way.
32,2010-04-10T21:02:48+00:00,stickguy,"even if it was a darker color instead of shiny silver. But, I know there is already 1 aftermarket grill (that I did not care for), so at some point, a body colored one will be available."

Someone visiting (I think, unless it stays around) across the street had a very new looking Porsche Carerra convertible. Looked like a light bronze/moondust color (in the dark).

And man, skinny little tires. Looked like rubber bands on the wheels. And with the bumper crop of potholes this year, I would be afraid to take it out of my driveway!"
35,2010-04-11T16:20:17+00:00,fintail,"Grocery store parking lot last night, new W221 S600, sitting there idling with no driver, but a passenger sitting reading a newspaper. Another person who shouldn't be driving such a car"
36,2010-04-11T18:57:52+00:00,3233,"The Infiniti QX56 has, by far, the most spacious rear seats of any vehicle I've been in-pro basketball players would have no trouble with head/leg room. But for that you have to spend 60,000 dollars and live with a gas guzzling truck with tank-like driving dynamics, and the 3rd row is little bigger than that of a Rav 4.

It seems that while cars have grown in the past decades, interior room has not caught up, with most of the expansion being safety or design related and not improving interior space, headroom especially. My father purchased a new A4 recently to replace an older Maxima, and while it has decent legroom the headroom is pitiful. Granted, it's a ""sporty"" car, but there's no reason for such a lack of headroom in a mid-sized sedan.

Back on topic, I saw a new Toyota Sienna today. The back looked good, kind of like the Venza, but the front just looked like the poor van had gotten beaten and was swollen. The number of Camaros has grown exponentially as the economy began to picked back up here in Atlanta during the last few months. The more I see these plastic, Hot Wheels-looking cars, the more I appreciate the more subdued styling of the Challenger and the Mustang. I'm also looking forward to seeing the new Infiniti M around town. It's a beautiful car from what I can tell, and should sway some people over from the mainstay MBs and BMWs, since it seemed like the styling was the big factor in limiting the car's success during the last generation."
37,2010-04-12T13:55:17+00:00,ateixeira,"It's hard to make a van look good. They're basically one giant box.

Having said that the new Sienna is the least ugly."

Sadly, we had to return to (I can't remember, it was 1986), either my Caprice or my companion's Scirocco and left the (usual red w/tan interior) Mondial alone."

48,2010-04-17T01:33:43+00:00,3233,"I think the Odyssey (current one) looks the best. The Sienna just looks like Camry headlights slapped on to a huge front fascia, making the whole front end look awful and bloated. I'd prefer the sharper looking Highlander if I was in the market for a people carrier, sacrificing a little room for better fuel economy and a halfway decent looking vehicle.

I saw a Porsche Panamera S today. A good looking car in person, if a little ungainly from some angles. I still can't understand why Porsche/Aston/Bugatti can't make a proper, 3 box four door, but if it goes fast while being practical I guess I can let it slide.

I also saw a 335d today. I know they've been out for a while but they're rare in the Atlanta area, at least compared to the ubiquitous 328i. I bet that car's awesome off the line with that torquey diesel and gets great mileage too. It's about time for the diesel stigma to go away here in America (taking the higher diesel taxes along with it)."
49,2010-04-19T15:00:09+00:00,ateixeira,"I'm not a fan of the Highlander. It's hard to make big boxy shapes look good. The Volvo XC60 is one of a few exceptions.

You reminded me, I saw a Panamera as well. Still getting used to that big rump.

I do like the AM Rapide, very much actually. Have yet to see one in the flesh, though."

* diesels

That's 3 strikes. They'd sell about 2 of them (yours and mine)."
4,2010-05-04T15:38:39+00:00,fintail,"Remember when it was rumored we'd get an Accord diesel? I was actually thinking about looking at it when it came out. Instead, we get the Crosstour and a blandified Acura wagon."
5,2010-05-04T15:52:05+00:00,ateixeira,"Is the TSX wagon going to be auto only?

With that 4 banger you really need the manual."

7,2010-05-04T18:15:08+00:00,ateixeira,"Weaksauce.

The Mazda6 wagon was offered with a V6 and a manual.

And, at under $26k, doesn't seem like a bad deal."

I sat in one at the auto show that was optioned up to $28k and still had cloth. Gotta pick options carefully, but it sure is a lot nicer than the Tiguan inside."

No wonder everybody buys a CR-V. Those things top out in the 20s even loaded."
12,2010-05-04T21:07:37+00:00,kyfdx,"Probably $35K-$36K.... more, if you get the Tech package..

""From all appearances, the only differences between the Euro Accord wagon and the TSX Sport Wagon are the addition of Acura badges and a slightly more upscale interior. Powering the Sport Wagon is the same 2.4-liter inline-four found in the sedan, mated exclusively to a five-speed automatic transmission. Official fuel economy numbers haven't been finalized just yet, but Acura claims that the wagon will achieve around 30 miles per gallon on the highway.""

So this says the 4-banger."
14,2010-05-04T22:17:40+00:00,qbrozen,"Ya know, I may be missing something, but can you even GET leather in the Jetta? I'm checking out the VW website and it seems like options are auto trans, panoramic moonroof, and a few choices of wheels. That's about it. Anything else is just accessories.

Sizewise, I think it is pretty big in its latest interation. I think it is at least as big as the previous gen Passat, ain't it?"
15,2010-05-04T23:58:31+00:00,kyfdx,"The TDI? I think leather might be standard... (but, see above.. I'm often mistaken..)"
16,2010-05-05T02:26:39+00:00,stickguy,pretty sure that the leatherette is standard across the line in the jetta. wouldn't be surprised if they don't have leather at all.
17,2010-05-05T02:46:57+00:00,kyfdx,"I think you are right... the Jetta GLI used to have optional leather...

You know what else the Jetta isn't available with? The 2.0T gas engine.. It's all 2.5 5-cylinders or the diesel.."

Now, I would be willing to get a diesel, but no interest in that 2.5 engine.

I did see a 5 speed jetta 2.5 for sale today. Was at the honda dealer for an oil change, and always cruise the used lot. They had a 2007 Wolfsburg edition. Roof, 5 speed. Nice gray color. Somewhat of an odd ball."
19,2010-05-05T12:18:12+00:00,anythngbutgm,"But my co-worker brought in a brand new Acura TSX today after trading in his 2001 Accord V6 that just bumped 250 thousand miles. The Accord was apparently bouncing back an engine code for a misfire and the mileage wasn't so hot so he moved on the Acura. The car was flawless up until a few weeks ago.

And the legendary Honda resale value kicked in as well. Got 2500 bucks trade in value. :shades:"
20,2010-05-05T17:23:30+00:00,boomchek,That's actually really good money for a miled up Accord. I'm sure someone who swears by Hondas will pick it up and drive it some more after a tune up.

I did end up buying one, but made sure to be careful in the lower gears."
26,2010-05-06T15:39:18+00:00,ateixeira,I hope Hyundai at least offers a real limited-slip.

Big improvement in looks from the 350Z... butt is much less droopy.."
28,2010-05-06T17:09:54+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I agree completely, the original Z was a C+ from a styling standpoint and about the same in quality. Timeless engine, excellent chassis, chintzy interior and porky looks. The convertible with it's bubbly butt did the profile zero justice. My S2k club commonly refers to it as the ""Wide [non-permissible content removed] Z""

The new one looks so much tauter and much more solidly built right down to the sheen of the paint. Interior is greatly improved as well. The convertible looks to be more purposeful rather than an afterthought like the last one."
29,2010-05-06T17:55:37+00:00,qbrozen,"Eh. I like the 350 better. Still one of the best looking cars on the road. I like the improvements on the 370, but not so much the looks. I just can't get used to the funky lights."

31,2010-05-10T12:30:03+00:00,kyfdx,Sonata is probably a rental car..
32,2010-05-10T14:01:24+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw 3 Sonatas over the weekend, all with temp tags.

That one leaped out of the starting gate and fast."

The Sonata is getting better MPG than her Elantra."
34,2010-05-10T21:41:39+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, definite rental, which is a good ploy by Hyundai, putting their latest and greatest into the mass market fleets. I have seen high spec previous generation Sonatas in local fleets too. The Camrys I see in local fleets are all SE models as well."

36,2010-05-12T19:01:08+00:00,ateixeira,"Looks OK top down.

A lot of the folding hardtops look awkward.

I think they look better in darker colors because you don't notice the trunk seams."
37,2010-05-12T19:35:47+00:00,boomchek,I don't like the back half. It looks very bulky. BMW did a much better job with their 3 series folding hardtop.
38,2010-05-12T19:48:40+00:00,ateixeira,The 3 is probably the cleanest execution of a 4 seat folding hardtop.

Ya, let's stick with the link instead..."
40,2010-05-12T23:32:50+00:00,boomchek,"When the top is closed on the G, it looks a bit akward. Probably because we're used to the sleek C pillar of the G coupe. The 3 series is closest to looking like the coupe."
41,2010-05-13T02:16:08+00:00,fintail,Saw a dark grey 5er GT today...don't call it a hatchback!
42,2010-05-14T14:59:07+00:00,ateixeira,"The G (and IS for that matter) folding hardtops have no back seat at all. Pointless - just get a roadster and save weight/cost.

The 3 at least has a back seat for kids."
43,2010-05-14T14:59:33+00:00,ateixeira,Another one with temporary tags. They're becoming ubiquitous.
44,2010-05-16T02:16:11+00:00,fintail,"Saw what looked like a late open Ferrari F430 on my street today...I've read these things are piling up at dealerships with the new generation of Ferraris in force. The guy driving it didn't look particularly thrilled...the guy in the 560SL a few cars behind him looked to be enjoying himself more,

Also saw another rental Sonata."
45,2010-05-16T21:28:47+00:00,fintail,"Saw another Sonata rental today, this one in white. I wonder who has that fleet...I have to rent a car next month, and I'd be interested to have one of those. Of course, I'll end up with a neglected Spectra reading 45K on the odo."
46,2010-05-17T18:00:51+00:00,ateixeira,"In a nice red.

Honda changed the Fit already? (has the NA version caught up now or something?)

Just did a 3+ day road trip over to Yellowstone and the Tetons. Only new car I spotted looked like a lifted Corvette from the back. Was a Camaro. Looked a bit like the Charger but I like the Camaro better."

The rear suspension seems to be sagging a bit. The gap in the front fender is bigger than in the rear. I wonder if it's just worn shocks? Or do those have active suspensions and maybe something needs repair?"
6,2010-05-20T19:47:09+00:00,fintail,"I think they just kind of sit slightly saggy in the butt, and the styling also adds to the look. I can't imagine a highbrow main dealer selling a defective car like that either."

By the way - it's a Hybrid.

No surprise, there are tons of soft-touch surfaces. Elbow rests, door panels, dash, fabric-wrapped A-pillars, padded headliners, plush carpets, the works. This is not a Prius by a long shot. It's better in many areas than my buddy's Camry hybrid, except interior room.

The seats are perforated leather, again glove-soft. The dash and other parts are wrapped in a soft-touch vinyl they probably call leatherette, but it's softer than you'd expect and may not be very durable with abuse.

It's eerily quiet at low speeds with the engine off, naturally. Very smooth in operation, but nothing here to get your heart pumping. I drove the last little bit, including a very challenging parking job in a tight spot. The backup cam came in handy, that screen is HUGE, too. 8"" at least.

She got Navi on it, and told me she loves the concierge service - you hit a button and it's like calling 411, except they find it for you and enter your destination. Very red carpet. It doesn't even use her phone, so I guess there must be some monthly fee associated with the service (wonder if it's satellite linked?).

Lexus knows their customers well. She's delighted with the car, FWIW.

$38 grand loaded up with Navi, moonroof, etc."
25,2010-05-26T20:04:55+00:00,qbrozen,"But I THINK it was a Ferrari California. Top down. Ferrari red, of course. It was just nosing out of a driveway when I was going past, so I only saw it for a brief second. But enough that I spotted the hood scoop and curvaceous fenders.

I don't believe there is anything else from Ferrari in recent years that has both those features. I didn't think California until I got to work and looked it up. I was thinking something with Maranello in the name (forgive me for not knowing all the damned numbers). So when I was perusing the pics on the web, that's when I discovered the scoop and curved fenders are not a common combo in their designs. The 575M Maranello is close, and probably what I was thinking of, but the fenders are definitely too straight on that model."
26,2010-05-26T20:07:35+00:00,fintail,"Saw another new Sonata...this one undoubtedly a private purchase, fancier wheels and new temporary registration on the window."

The Sienna tho is keeping right with it in my area, selling like gangbusters."
28,2010-05-26T20:17:54+00:00,ateixeira,"IIHS just gave the Sienna the Top Safety Pick designation (first minivan to do so), which won't hurt sales, which were already way up."

I really believe AWD popularity is on a huge upswing (Look at Subie ) so offering that feature in a minivan is a great alternative to conventional SUV's. Also, isnt the Sienna capable of carrying a sheet of plywood with the rear hatch closed?

Don't think there is a single ute out there besides maybe one of Government Motors school busses (Escalade, Yukon XL, Suburban) that can claim the same ability..."
30,2010-05-26T21:06:44+00:00,ateixeira,"Even the old one (2004-2010) could fit plywood with room to spare:

See more Car Pictures at CarSpace.com

I'm surprised you call it a 7/8 Odyssey, though, since it actually had more interior volume, 148.9 vs. 147.4 cubic feet."
31,2010-05-26T22:22:09+00:00,fezo,"And of course we know that plywood is the official measuring unit for such things.

It's right up there with football fields for describing how big a piece of land is... or a big building.

Speaking of that, my daughter used to go to a high school that was built inside the hanger that used to house the Hindenburg when it was stateside. Even with this high school built in it they said it was big enough to run three regulation football games in at once. When the Hindenburg was in it it stuck out at both ends."
32,2010-05-27T01:11:25+00:00,3233,"And those GM full sizers cost more, get 12-14mpg in real world driving (per a relative) and have less spacious seating than vans (again, per a relative). The normal family with 2.5 kids (rounded up to 3) should have plenty of space in a van.

On topic, a lot of Sonatas are springing up around here. I've spoken to a couple people who own them and they all absolutely love their cars. We all love to bash modern cars for being too heavy, too boring, too coddling, but I really think Hyundai hit it out of the park with this one. Great mileage, good driving dynamics, and an interior that belies its low cost. Not bad Hyundai."
33,2010-05-27T12:54:13+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Really? Wow that's impressive. I'll admit to not delving into too much research on minivans as I don't have any kids myself, but side by side I have always thought the Sienna was smaller than the Odyssey.

Impressive packaging"
34,2010-05-27T13:23:45+00:00,fushigi,The Sienna has always looked smaller on the outside to me as well. I haven't shopped the segment so I can't really say I pay that much attention to them. I'm sure the interior packaging/layout makes the space feel different and affects usability.
35,2010-05-27T14:11:57+00:00,ateixeira,"The new Sienna is wider outside, FWIW.

Inside, though, Honda puts the spare tire on the left rear side, upright. So that eats up some width. At that spot the Sienna is a good 5"" wider. I'm sure that's where it wins the cargo volume battle.

Toyota puts the spare under the vehicle. Honda puts the Lazy Susan storage system there instead. So, pick your poison, I suppose.

Saw yet another new Sienna this morning, in Silver.

Also saw a silver Sonata with temp tags.

Then I found myself driving behind a new 4Runner.

What a weird coincidence - I'm watching the Motor Week review of that exact car. They said it's slightly sportier than the normal Lexus, but far from 'sporty'. 'Soft suspension...plenty of body roll...fine on regular roads...more of a baby step'. Doesnt sound like the German 3 have much to worry about."
38,2010-05-31T18:18:45+00:00,fintail,"I wonder if the Germans made a softie version of their large cars, if any Lexus people would buy it. Probably not, as it would retain the Euro dealer and service experience.

I saw a fun one last night, at a gas station...a GT-R...decked out with an obnoxious bodykit and a big wing on the back. What's wrong with stock on a car like that? And the owner...I will just say it completed the full [non-permissible content removed] effect."

Pretty darned sharp looking. certainly makes a statement.

Almost seems like a Buick from the sides, with an almost Lincolnish grill.

But with the hood ornament, certainly makes a statement. And a really, really nice interior.

I know they aren't out yet, but I know someone in Hyundai corporate, and he always has the new stuff a few months in advance.

If Acura could have put this out as the new RL, it would have revitalized the brand."

I am seeing at least a couple new Sonatas a day here. However, a lot of them are rentals...I wonder of H is pulling a GM."
4,2010-06-07T18:58:40+00:00,ateixeira,"Loved it.

I don't like the styling either, but it's not nearly as bad as the X6, and has twice the back seat. Plus a huge glass roof to serve front and rear.

Likes: smooth ride combined with nearly zero body roll, so very impressive ride/handling balance. 550i had torque down low and boost up high so you're always happy with the engine. Trans was slow in D mode, but DS (Drive Sport) fixed that, and you have 8 ratios to play with.

Dislikes: black text on Navi screen was hard to read despite big widescreen (Benz' smaller screen was better, ironically). No manual or at least paddle shifters. And...I'm thinking...still thinking...OK, the boot was easy to open but noone could figure out how to open the hatch, including the BMW staffer (not a 3rd party employee, he worked for BMW).

$79 grand and change. Ouch.

I could get past the styling EASILY after driving it. Total non-factor.

The funny thing is the 550i GT revealed many flaws in the 535i - laggy engine, cozy back seat (relateive to GT and E class), no rear moonroof, no seat memory for the passenger, etc.

Moral of the story - if you want a good BMW, don't just buy the base model, get the right engine and options.

Personally I might go for a 550i sedan (are manuals still available?) if I were shopping in that class.

I should go test an M35/45 for reference."

I know the leading German rental car company has bought large quantities of the GT and if you rent in the LDAR group, chances are you'll get one or an F10 5er. I might be going over later in the year, and possibly renting a car for a couple days...if I do, maybe I'll get one (but I will be praying for an S-class upgrade of course).

BMW site lists a manual for the 550 sedan but none for the GT."

9,2010-06-07T19:54:35+00:00,fintail,"The head up display should be turned on via a button on the lower left dashboard, if it is like the 7er. There is also a recessed flat panel low on the top of the dash near the windshield to tell if the car has the feature. On the BMW system it is very handy, it gives many inputs - speed, speed limit, arrows and distances for nav directions. A case where it is very true the more options, the better...but I would buy it used and let someone else pay for that :shades:

I also see Surround View is available for October 2010, so not yet.

We did have lane departure warning but I didn't get how it worked - it seemed like both sides were lit all the time. Maybe it lights up even brighter, but of course I didn't test it out.

The brochure itself is WEAK, very little information, no technical specs at all. Almost more of a preview brochure. Not even options lists for each model."
13,2010-06-08T17:46:27+00:00,fintail,"My 7er had lane departure warning...it also vibrates the steering wheel. Pretty goofy, and I had it switched off most of the time. I guess if a person is a habitually sleepy driver it could be handy. The car also had the blind spot warning system, but I never was able to get it to react.

Something like a 550i is something to buy new if you like losing money...see what a 2007 model sells for now. Somehow those large engined 5ers always have poor resale."
14,2010-06-08T17:51:08+00:00,ateixeira,"Dunno, I spent 535i money on my Miata and Sienna combined. It's not as fun as the Miata nor as practical as the 8 seat van.

The 550i GT does a reasonable compromise at both purposes, but it costs more than I spent even if you add my wife's Forester and a new jet ski! :surprise:"

And if you buy CPO, do you still get the rest of the 4 year's free service?

I was admiring a convertible 335i, which had 9k miles but actually was priced the same as a 135i convertible in the same showroom. The 3 was CPO, the 1 was new.

$43 grand for a 135i seemed insane to me. :surprise:"

1er could be one of the most overpriced cars out there if you load it up...I think they can be pushed past 50K."
23,2010-06-09T15:34:06+00:00,ateixeira,"you have to pay to play with these cars

That's what I suspected.

I was lucky with a used Miata, cost me nearly nothing over 8 years or so. That's a car that totally broke that rule, you play but you don't pay (much).

For what I spent on my Miata and Sienna combined, about $48k, I could get one very nice Bimmer, I suppose. I drove an X5 and didn't like it much, though, too heavy. Plus we car pool groups of kids around for after school activities. A Benz GL would do but they're very spendy.

Back on topic, saw a MazdaSpeed3, and no the new face still hasn't grown on me."
24,2010-06-09T23:12:53+00:00,fintail,"You won't get off cheaply with a no-warranty Euro...even if it has no mechanical faults, consumables and servicing are going to be more than a normal car.

I don't like the Mazda3 smiling front end at all, dorky, would put me off from buying one."
25,2010-06-09T23:21:00+00:00,ajvdh,"I've had a couple of track events recently, and that's always good for grins.

1 - BMW club autocross: Tesla. Looks a lot like an Elise (go figure!). Very slow (I beat him by almost 3 seconds on a 45 second course), but I know he's not one of our faster drivers. And he was on those eco-tires they saddle the poor thing with.

2 - BMW club driving school: Student cars included a 650 coupe, a 550, a couple of new M3s, plus the odd Evo10. The Jalpa wasn't exactly new, but pretty exotic. It also started spewing oil during its first session, so he spent the rest of the day in his girlfriend's older 325.
You know the instructor group is getting out of hand when one guy brings an R8, another guy brings a Porsche GT3, and they're not the fastest things out there - there were at least 2 E36 M3 race cars that gave up a little in straight line speed, but had better lap times due to superior braking and lateral grip.
I'm not as impressed with hot street cars as I used to be - on a track the $120k the GT3 costs will get you something faster and better at protecting you if you do screw up. And you'll have enough change to buy a really nice rig to tow it with.

3 - NASA road race: A Panoz GTS, which had to get dragged back to the pits after its motor let go."
26,2010-06-14T01:47:25+00:00,fintail,"Was at the local MB dealer today and saw a SL65 black series, with the big bodykit etc...pretty crazy car."
27,2010-06-14T02:02:42+00:00,texases,"There's an SL guy in my parking garage, just replace his '05 SL600 with an SL63. Rough life...."
28,2010-06-14T16:14:08+00:00,euphonium,Maybe he just leases.
29,2010-06-14T18:08:47+00:00,texases,"I bet you're right about the SL leasing. Still, some serious $$/month!"
30,2010-06-14T18:53:59+00:00,ajvdh,"On the road between Boulder, CO and Lyons. Probably here for high altitude testing. Later on that day I saw an original 500 in downtown Boulder. Those suckers are tiny!"
31,2010-06-15T00:21:07+00:00,fintail,"Saw a fun one today...a Hybrid Lexus HS Hybrid HS250H Hybrid H Hybrid. Not so remarkable, but this one had wheels that I think were from a IS-F, and what looked like a bodykit as well. What the hell?"
32,2010-06-15T00:24:36+00:00,stickguy,"a prior generation (2004 I think) 4 door accord. aftermark wheels (but normal size), tint and window deflecto(rain guards, whatever you call them). Nothing obscene.

The mid-rise hoop wing was a little silly, but not outrageous.

But, the twin snorkle hood scoops (looked like a recent GTO) really put it over the top.

New Mexico plates too, up in New Jersey.

I decided my Accord really needs a set of those snouts. Should knock a good 1-2 seconds off the 0-60, right?"
33,2010-06-16T18:32:46+00:00,ateixeira,"Nothing like enormous wheels to increase unsprung weight and take away a hybrid's efficiency!

I saw a Jetta that was so cheesed up it looked like a Mercury Milan!"
34,2010-06-16T18:39:17+00:00,fintail,"Spoilers and fender vents make the most hp gains, but fake air intakes add a bit too. Should be good for an 11 second quarter mile"
35,2010-06-16T18:40:38+00:00,fintail,"I was thinking the hybrid had specific wheels, but these ones seemed larger and different. Unless that blandbox has some kind of sport package...someone swapped them out.

I saw a new style CTS with a vinyl top not long ago...old habits..."
36,2010-06-16T18:41:02+00:00,ateixeira,"Each sticker also adds 2hp, 5 if it's yellow."
37,2010-06-16T18:54:34+00:00,fintail,NOS sticker adds at least 50hp.

39,2010-06-16T22:53:40+00:00,boomchek,"Saw the 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee today at our Jeep training session. Very impressed with everything about this vehicle.
Interior quality is top notch, body is sexier than ever, and some of the technological advancements in it would be at home on luxury vehicles. Heck even the fender wells were lined with some sort of synthetic sound deadening materials,
Tons of room inside too, and the best part was the avaiable Quadra Lift air suspension that gives you a 4.5 inch lift for your 4X4 needs. I shot a quick video of the Jeep doing its thing on a set of ramps, while on the highest setting. Link is here:

41,2010-06-17T12:10:20+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I really dig the new GC as well man, it is a ginormous improvement from the outgoing model which I found was huge step down from the previous one. It's nice to see that they have gone back to a more elegant, upscale and classy design, the last one could have been a Dodge Durango it was so blocky and cheap."
42,2010-06-17T16:33:19+00:00,ateixeira,"Like it at the car show and haven't seen anything to change that impression.

It's handsome right out of the box, no waiting for it to grow on me, either.

Sales will double instantly, watch."
43,2010-06-17T16:56:51+00:00,boomchek,"Believe it or not it's chassis is actually based on the current ML. Development on this started when Chrysler was still with Mercedes.

Also on a side note: Chrysler uses Mercedes keys for almost all their vehicles now, and I noticed Chrysler and Mercedes share power window switches too."
44,2010-06-17T17:08:26+00:00,lemko,"Heck, the shifter in the 300 is similar to the one used in the older E-Class."
45,2010-06-17T17:12:30+00:00,ateixeira,"Didn't they borrow the whole rear suspension?

We'll see Fiat slowly phase that stuff out, probably when future new models arrive.

Fiat can help Chrysler, though, because they specialize in small cars, which was Chrysler's weakness. Let Dodge build trucks, Chrysler build minivans, Jeep build off roaders, and Fiat build B- and C-segment cars.

That could actually work well for them."
46,2010-06-17T17:31:33+00:00,fintail,"I think I have read the ML platform might have meant to go to Jeep to begin with, but was pilfered.

I will agree that GC is a vast improvement, and I know Chrysler has been working hard on interior quality upgrades. So long as gas remains reasonable, and the economy doesn't collapse...it should find plenty of customers.

Does Chrysler use the fob style key, with no actual metal key?

Hopefully Chrysler doesn't use old fashioned MB rear window regulators..."
47,2010-06-17T18:21:03+00:00,boomchek,"As far as I know it is still based on the ML. How extnesive that basis is, I'm not sure.

The keys are the fob style with no metal key, with the acual metal key being inside the fob.

The interior is amazing on this one, even in the base form. Wouldn't look out of place on a luxury european vehicle. Apparently ecenomy is great too on the new Pentastar V6, giving it the ability to have 600 mile cruisng ranges on the 97 L gas tank."
48,2010-06-17T20:02:55+00:00,fintail,Will there be a diesel?
49,2010-06-17T20:18:49+00:00,boomchek,"Maybe, but nothing soon. For now just the new Pentastar V6 and the Hemi V8."

2011 Odyssey.

My god, it is hideous. makes the crosstour look attractive. It actually reminds me of the rambler or studebaker that gets posted occasionally (the weird wagon with the reverse D pillar) .

maybe it won't be as nasty in person, but I doubt it.

All Honda has to do is botch the pending Civic redesign, and they will have successfully converted their entire product line into stuff that ranges from ugly and ungainly (Accord, Pilot) to downright strange and gagable (everything else!)

Oh, the CRV is not too bad, if you don't look at it from the front."
1,2010-06-21T12:38:08+00:00,lemko,"Here's a picture as a point of reference. Actually, it doesn't look too bad from this angle. Heck, it's a minivan, not a sports car. Of course the Crosstour and its Acura sister are grotesque! What were they thinking?"

3,2010-06-21T15:16:22+00:00,lemko,"I see that odd ""drop-down"" in the rear window. The pic above is of a Honda Odyssey. Maybe it's the 2012 model?"
4,2010-06-21T15:17:21+00:00,fintail,"That's a JDM car, which of course will be better than what we'll get on these dumbed-down shores.

5,2010-06-21T18:08:07+00:00,ateixeira,"Ours isn't really dumbed-down, it's actually a much bigger vehicle than what Japan gets. Totally different model.

To me it looks like the rear 1/3rd of the new Ody is falling off."
6,2010-06-21T18:58:53+00:00,fintail,"Bigger, but no doubt dynamically inferior with less tech to boot. Of course, that seems to be what this market asks for :sick:

Saw 2 new E-class today, coupe and sedan. I'd call it a success now."
7,2010-06-21T20:29:58+00:00,boomchek,"I totally agree with you about Honda. They sort of butchered Acura and now they're butchering the Honda lineup. The CRV is ok because it was redesigned around mid decade before Honda got hit with the ugly stick.

The current Odyssey looked good as a concept, but once translated into a production model, all the worst parts came out. It remind me of a car collage:

12,2010-06-21T21:30:49+00:00,tifighter,"Its funny, but the concept and production model both have the same sliding door track, yet the concept looks a lot cleaner due to what appears to be body color paint for the track itself.

14,2010-06-22T18:18:49+00:00,ateixeira,"A friend saw it and thought the concept was photo-chopped. The photo is staged and softened significantly.

Darker body colors will probably hide the sliding door track better, it's an eye sore IMHO."
15,2010-06-22T19:41:17+00:00,texases,"Found myself following the IS350C, with the top up. Not good. Here's the only pic I could find (ignore the tape, etc), it does show what I think is a very lumpy rear :sick:"
16,2010-06-22T20:01:44+00:00,boomchek,"I totally agree. I like the IS sedan, but the convertible has bad proportions."
17,2010-06-22T20:37:48+00:00,ateixeira,"Looks pin-headed, but to be fair, it's very, VERY hard to style a folding hard top properly.

That's because they have to be made compact so they fold up and don't take up the whole trunk.

I own a Miata but I'll admit - the soft top looks better than the power retractable top. Even the old manual hard top looks better.

Kudos to Mazda engineers, at least - they top takes up zero trunk space. Same amount of space top up or down. And the hard top's trunk matches the soft top's."
18,2010-06-22T21:01:12+00:00,fintail,"Luckily for Lexus, the target market for those things couldn't know or care less about proportions - they want the isolation and the badge."

21,2010-06-23T01:48:28+00:00,texases,"Not only did Lexus get the proportions wrong (like they already had on the SC430), the rest of the rear 1/3 of the car looked all wrong. Truely a mess."
22,2010-06-23T03:08:16+00:00,boomchek,I actually always like the SC430. I thought the proportions were nice on that one.
23,2010-06-23T03:26:45+00:00,fintail,"For some reason the SC reminds me of a (US) football...maybe because they had an interior option with football style leather. I think I have read they don't keep good body integrity as they age, at least on early models. Sadly, their favored demographic ruins in my eyes any merits the car could have."
24,2010-06-23T12:57:56+00:00,lemko,"No, it's not! Just make sure you put a little box in the trunk that allows luggage to be safely stored!"
25,2010-06-23T13:00:28+00:00,lemko,"Sadly, their favored demographic ruins in my eyes any merits the car could have.

Aging boomers with golf bags? They're the only guys I see driving them."
26,2010-06-23T15:06:20+00:00,fintail,"It's either the retired dentist set, or the botox-injected middle aged woman set. Around here probably the latter in a 5:1 ratio."
27,2010-06-23T17:28:42+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw one of those in the flesh in Old Town Kissimmee, Florida, a couple of years ago. Very cool (and yes the hard top took nothing away from the styling).

Isolation isn't always a bad thing. As a passenger in a Lexus ES I was about as comfortable as I've ever been in any moving vehicle. I just wouldn't want to drive it."
28,2010-06-23T20:42:16+00:00,fintail,There's a big market for it as Lexus has proven. I could have slept in a then year-old LS I rode in. As they say...there's a butt for every seat :shades:

Two best looking ones in that class, IMHO."

The thing that really draws us to it is the amazing powertrain and the tech features. Plus, here in New England they are offering 6000 - 6900.00 off MSRP.

They're terrible sellers, but they're perfectly kept secrets to those who are more about performance than utility."

19,2010-07-27T14:50:58+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Took a new 2011 3.6R Outback out for a spin yesterday afternoon. Loaded to the gills with the NAV option Even got the new Ruby Red color (which looks fantastic btw). Gotta say it drove a lot smaller than it looked, even more nimble than my wifes 08'. The engine only had 5 miles on it so I didn't really push it but there appears to be a nice amount of grunt off the line.

Also, I have yet to really meet an Automatic that I liked enough to live with on a daily basis but the 5-speed in this model was absolutely perfect. Shifts were seamless and there was zero lag for the sake of fuel economy. Everytime I needed a little more go, it was always in the exact gear to maximize performance.

Visibility was excellent as well, no real blind spots, especially the rear headrests which are a bit big on the wifes car. Seat comfort, ergonomics, controls and quality were first rate. This particular model had leather which was as comfy as the LL Bean seats in our car although not as much side bolstering.

My only qualm was to change the radio station, there was no real display to show you what station you were on unless you used the option in the Nav screen.

One thing my sales person couldn't answer, are the radio station changes voice activated? I really didn't spend a whole lot of time with the voice activation functions.

All in all, a really nice, nice car. I've been car shopping lately and had narrowed it down to the Infiniti EX35 and the Volvo XC60 Turbo but after drivining the 3.6R I am definitely re-evaluating. :shades:"

Still, the way I would configure it (SEL hatch, DSG, moonroof but cloth seats w/o un warmers), the sticker is $19,500ish. Probably not a whole lot of discounting at this point, so say 19K purchase price.

Anyways, so I followed this thing for about a mile and all of a sudden it comes to yet another stop, and three of the lugnuts drop out from the passenger rear wheel. Literally, they just ""plink plink plink"" like jacks.

If the traffic wasn't moving I was going to jump out and grab them. Not sure if the rest of them fell off or they lost a wheel or anything as immediately afterwards they sped off down the breakdown lane and got off the next exit.

Cooper Clubman. Let's see when the Countryman models start showing up.

The funny one was a Porsche Panamera. I only got a split second glance of the back in traffic, and at first I thought it was an Infiniti EX35! LOL

Funny because one's a crossover and the other is a sedan, yet both have the bulbous rear and that threw me off.

And visited a friend today that recently had twins (1st kids), so they got a minivan to tote them around.

ended up with a nice red T&C touring model. Nice and loaded, with dual screen DVD, and plenty of other bells and whistles. Really nice looking interior too.

They did look at honda and toyota too, but the difference in price (including an over allowance on a trade) was huge, and ChryCo also had .9%financing.

they actually liked all 3 (in different ways), but found the T&C to be a fine option, so the major $$ savings (hey, twins can get to be expensive) was too much to pass up.

and they tend to keep cars a long time, so resale is not likely to be an issue."

Anyway, very nice car. Big upgrade from the old one. And roomier in the back seat (noticeably). Just not sure that it will sellat 44K (the sticker on an absolutely loaded to the gills sampe they had).

I did see a nice XC60 the other day that stickered for right around 40K, and that is the same engine/drivetrain as the S60.

I have to figure that a smaller engine (2.0turbo? Or the old 5 cyl) with FWD will be quite a bit less.

I must say this is a pretty nice car, not necessarily what I'd get for the $$$ but certainly a nice car in many respects. I'm at sixes and sevens about the styling- it's good looking but unless you see the grille it could as easily be a Bimmer or a Lexus.

Like many Benz owners, he's a busy guy who owns multiple businesses and hasn't had the time to study the owners manual to learn the fine points of the many systems and gadgets on the car. This creates an odd paradox in which buyers pay big bucks for fully optioned cars but don't take full advantage of them. :confuse:

I'm thinking of asking him to give the car to me for a couple of days and then I'll give him a tutorial. :P

Like most Mercs the car feels solid and rides beautifully. He demonstrated the radar-controlled cruise control which is easy to use and works very well. He also demonstrated the handling by way of almost overdoing bit on an exit ramp. This tank will corner quite nicely.

I was struck to note that the shifter has been moved to the steering column which is counter to Mercedes' tradition and the current trend toward manu-matics. They were the first to move the shifter to the console and the first to offer a manual shifting capability (via gated selector grid). It didn't look like it would be easy to manually select a lowerr gear but the transmission was utterly smooth in it's operation.

According to the owner the E3250 is worth the money."

My NA Miata had sealed beams and in darkness it went from pitch dark (off) to merely ""dark"" when you turned them on.

From Wiki:

""Dodge topped off the new 1969 cars with a new option, which forecast the projector-beam halogen headlamps that came into use years later. It was called ""Super-Lite,"" and consisted of a $50 optional road lamp mounted in the driver's side of the grille. The premise behind the Super-Lite was to enhance visibility at night in situations where more light than the standard low beams was needed but the high beams would cause glare to oncoming drivers. Despite the fanfare surrounding the Super-Lite that had been introduced the previous year, Dodge dropped the light option at the end of the 1970 model year because of a lack of consumer interest and challenges to its legality in some states."""

Crosstour is a different story - it's getting clobbered by the Outback, and sales are way below projections."

I wish I could remember the vanity plate on it because it added to the mess. All the while I am thinking 'that's enough to put lemko into a Toyota!""

I really hate seeing a pretty car destroyed.

Meanwhile i saw two Corsicas today. Did we go back to the 90s and no one told me?"
46,2010-10-21T22:00:17+00:00,fushigi,"I meant in terms of looks/styling and performance, not so much sales."
47,2010-10-21T23:52:25+00:00,lemko,Blame the dealership and the car's owner for that self-destructive add-on junk. All that stuff is aftermarket garbage. I can't believe anybody finds that trash desirable. My DTS is free of all that mess.
48,2010-10-22T01:05:03+00:00,fintail,"Saw a ZDX today. Eek...at least it was black, so it was unobtrusive.

I saw a ~2005 STS with a thick padded cabrio top the other day. Hard to get respect with that. Although locally there is a period custom W126 with a vinyl top, but no padding."

I'm waiting to see a real life Snuze. Not like I can go to the local dealer who has one new car in - an Impala at the moment. Next nearest dealer is maybe 30 miles away. Dealership situation in NJ looks terrible for Chevy. We do have a thriving Buick - GMC dealer in town."
6,2010-10-25T16:17:47+00:00,stickguy,"looks better in my (more southern) end of the state. 4 good size dealers (that I can think of) in a ring around my town. Anywhere from 5-10 miles from my house.

1 car? Is the rest trucks, or is some guy running a Chevy dealership out of his driveway? The one that I stopped at last week to see a Cruze had fewer cars than in past years (and lots of acreage to put them on), but he still had at least 15 Camaros all lined up on th main road out front. And 2 nice GS Corvettes in the showroom."

We had a new mazda3 sedan loaner while the wife's car was in for service. Thought it odd that they had what is essentially a base model (2 liter and no moonroof) but with alloy wheels and bluetooth. huh. Anyway, it was uninspiring and very very small inside. My son could no fit behind me. Hell, nobody could, and I didn't even have the seat back all the way. Even with my knees against the dash, there was about 2 inches between my seatback and the front edge of the backseat.

When picking her car back up, I checked out the mazda2. Found the seating position more comfortable than the 3 and MORE BACKSEAT LEGROOM. How weird is that? Also discovered the boot had more usable space than you would think looking at it from the outside. Very deceiving. Not a bad looking little car."
16,2010-11-01T19:02:51+00:00,ajvdh,"Technically not ""new"", but rare enough: Not one, but two Noble M12s. One white, the other black. The white car's owner was apparently petrified by his ride, spending most of his laps giving point bys to everyone else. The black one was driven very well; I don't think even the true race cars were quicker. Also, a new Gallardo, which was about the only car going slower than the white Noble.
Interestingly, the Gallardo was trailered in, while both Nobles came and left under their own power."
17,2010-11-01T19:16:22+00:00,ateixeira,"I have yet to see the new Ody in the flesh.

In pics that big seam for the sliding doors bugs me. Honda said it was to create a wider interior, but that argument doesn't add up because the Sienna is narrower outside yet wider inside in both 2nd and 3rd rows.

It may be ugly, but at least it servers a dysfunction."
18,2010-11-01T19:25:47+00:00,fintail,"I've seen a couple - the little dealer in the podunk town where my mom lives even had one a couple weeks ago. The beltline dip is the weird thing for me. But, for a van it might just add a little character. Maybe."

What's a ""typically outfitted"" Sienna running? Somewhere between $24k for the base and pushing $40k for all the bells eh?"
25,2010-11-02T20:31:39+00:00,ateixeira,"Higher now..surprisingly higher.

Back in 07, when I got mine, a CE could be had for $21k, my mid-level LE was $25.5k, and you had to get AWD/leather/moon roof/laser cruise control/DVD/Navi to break $40k.

The new base model is a 4 banger, a mid-level LE is more like $27k now. I'd say Sienna prices are up a good $2500 across the board.

Still, to get a 6EAT on the Ody you have to get the Touring, and it's over $40k, and there's one model above that!

I'm glad I already bought my van, put it that way."

34,2010-11-03T03:51:10+00:00,stickguy,"friends that recently had twins needed something bigger than a 1999 Accord. So, off to minivan land. ended up shopping largely by price vs. features. And they managed to get a T&C (I think, could be a dodge) for way way way less than a Honda or toyota. Even got by far the best trade in value. Thing is loaded too. DVD, roof, leather. I think it is a limited.

Not sure what they actually paid, but the payments are significantly lower. And, they actually liked it better in many ways (driving, comfort, features) than the other choices.

And transit connects are all over the place by me. many replacing Econolines that really didn't carry that much weight or volume of stuff."

38,2010-11-03T20:18:07+00:00,tifighter,"Yeah, you are right Juice. 3.6L with 283hp and 260 lb-ft of torque. I'm not really a Chrysler expert, for sure, but it sounds like a pretty good package. The press release mentions that the suspension on all Caravans is reworked for better dynamics, which makes me wonder if the R/T will have further tweaks, or if it will be just a bigger wheel/tire combo.

This category has heated up; no doubt. Plus the new Quest is just around the corner..."
39,2010-11-03T21:33:05+00:00,stever,"My current Quest has been a gem, but I haven't been excited about them since the joint venture with Ford dissolved several years back (can you say excited about minivans? Maybe about the VW concept van that never went forward).

Toyota's interior isn't as good as the previous one.

The new Ody looks a bit odd, plus you have to spend $40k to get the 6EAT and the 28mpg they keep hyping.

Now Dodge, soon Nissan...definitely competitive. Both Honda and Toyota left an opportunity for new entries to step up and earn some conquest sales."
41,2010-11-04T22:30:08+00:00,tifighter,"Both Honda and Toyota left an opportunity for new entries to step up and earn some conquest sales.

I agree; I think Chrysler (& Nissan to a lesser extent) have a chance to regain some consumer mindshare/equity this time around. Right now, I think that Honda may be the biggest loser; they had the #1 van, and went more expensive at a time when consumers are looking a little harder at value. Press reaction is mixed. That hwy MPG rating is one of their biggest marketing tools, and it may be enough to win sales (smart consumers know that the combined rating is what matters). Expect lots of LX lease deals soon.

I honestly think Toyota and Chrysler will fight for #1 & 2 in the category. Nissan TBD."
42,2010-11-05T11:47:59+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, most Odys get an EPA 21 mpg combined.

I though I saw some in front of a dealership so I pulled over and had a quick peek. There were about six in a row, all in light colors that barely register but I did notice that the cars had a clean, compact look, almost sporty, as befitting an Opel Insignia in disguise. In the right color these might look like something but I guess the best you can do is black dark red metallic.

I noticed a couple had portho...err...ventiports on the top of the hood while others had none. :confuse: We've come to a point where the stylists at GM don't even know they should put the holes on the side where people can see 'em. :confuse: :sick:

Aside from that, and the totally avoidable error of naming after it one of Buick's least sporty lines, the Regal could be a step in the right direction for Gov...er ..General Motors."

And while not even remotely ""New"" anymore, what is up with the gas smell on the Lambdas? I followed yet another Buick Enclave that absolutely reeked of petrol, it was naussiating.

Well.... not really. Only the front fenders, hood, and doors matched the pickups. The ""bed"" was attached to the front, so that required new metal. And the back seat did fold flat rather than the flip and fold that the Blazers (for example) suffered with.

1st gen gets my vote, too. I owned one and loved it. The 22RE 4-cyl with 5-spd manual was pretty bulletproof and it was VERY off-roadable. A true SUV. Not to mention I think it was the best looking 4runner ever."
29,2010-11-17T18:24:21+00:00,fintail,"I had a co-worker who drove a ~1990 Toyota V6 4x4...nothing but trouble when it was about 10 years old, he ditched it and bought I think a newer 4cyl model that was better.

Saw several X1s in Berlin today, maybe it will be a success. Also saw one of those weird 4 door Minis.

On the Lexus thoughts, today I actually saw 2 of them...an LS430 not in taxi service, and an old IS200 with a Nurburgring sticker on the trunklid."
30,2010-11-17T18:27:15+00:00,lemko,"Are there still a lot of fintails in pristine condition on the streets over there? How about Adenauers and pontons? Are you renting a car over there? If so, which one and what kind?"
31,2010-11-17T18:33:44+00:00,fintail,"I've seen nothing older than a W114 here...fintails and older cars are held in the same esteem flamboyant 1950s cars are held in the US, and don't often see daily duty. Also, cars have to pass inspections here (unlike where I call home, where anything that runs can hit the road) and that makes hobby cars iffy daily drivers.

I have seen some cherished looking W123s, and there's a nice grey C126 on the street where I am staying. But those herds are thinning out now too. But anyway, there are few cars older than 1990 on the road here, most of them being W123s W124s W201s and VWs.

I'll have a car for a long weekend....I've booked in the 5er/E class group, won't mind an upgrade but won't complain if I get what I booked either :shades:"
32,2010-11-18T17:37:55+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Ferrari 612 parked in front of my hotel today, a small Aston, a Dacia Sandero (not new, but the name makes me chuckle now thanks to Top Gear), a big Lancia sedan with a name I can't recall, and a Citroen C6.

Record Lexus day here, 4 of them! an older and new IS, a GX, and a LS430 - but the latter was pulling into the Japanese embassy so I don't think it counts.

Oh yeah, one car I don't see at all here that I don't miss - Camry. Haven't seen one. They were sold here once, but didn't catch on where people like to drive."
33,2010-11-18T18:59:33+00:00,lemko,A place with no Camries? Germany sounds better and better with each description and they even have Cadillacs over there!
34,2010-11-19T17:33:13+00:00,ateixeira,"Do they even sell the Camry there?

The American one is bigger, I'm not even sure the same one is sold in Europe.

Don't they get an Avensis or something a bit smaller?

Also - can you blame Toyota for giving US buyers what they want? Big, soft, comfortable, quick only in a straight line (C&D 0-60 was 5.8 seconds for the V6).

They custom-built it for Americans."
35,2010-11-19T18:32:09+00:00,fintail,"They sold Camry here until the pig snout, IIRC. But nobody bought them, not even old people. I've only seen one in German speaking Europe, and it was being used as a taxi in Switzerland.

The Avensis sells here and there, especially the wagon, but is seen as fairly ""souless"". The middle-large market is very competitive and demanding here. Accord (TSX) sells probably better than the Avensis, but not in large volumes - here what we know as the TSX is not upmarket.

Saw an Aston Rapide today in downtown Berlin.

Only one Lexus today, an old IS going about 65mph on an unlimited part of the Autobahn."
36,2010-11-19T18:34:00+00:00,fintail,I saw a 58 Olds 4 door HT today...on the Autobahn no less (but a nightmarishly congested urban part)...continental kit and all...
37,2010-11-19T18:57:50+00:00,ateixeira,Rapide sounds nice. Perhaps the best looking sedan...ever?
38,2010-11-20T02:36:37+00:00,kyfdx,"Not that spotting one of these is so unusual..

But, this one was traveling faster than the surrounding traffic on the freeway... I'd say an easy 70 mph...

Almost every Smart I see is trundling along in the right lane, about 5-10 mph under the speed limit.. I always wondered if they were scary to drive fast, or they just attracted that sort of driver...

I'm going to have to wrangle a test drive, somehow...."
39,2010-11-20T21:34:37+00:00,ateixeira,"First in the flesh. Looked OK, I was a bit underwhelmed to be honest.

45,2010-11-22T19:09:14+00:00,ateixeira,"The CTS is nice - especially with the leather across the dash. Is that real leather?

Kia Optima has imitation stuff, so everyone's doing it now. I think one of the compact Fords has it also (Fiesta or Focus, not sure which).

Hyundai Genesis uses real cow hide on theirs."
46,2010-11-23T15:50:53+00:00,fushigi,"Load up any Cruze competitor with every possible option and they won't be substantially different in price.

With the subcompacts making a resurgence via the Fit, Yaris, Fiesta, etc. the compacts (some of which technically qualify as midsize) have been going up in price. The run-up in used car prices might have affected them as well.

Of course all that added equipment comes at a price as well. Cruze, for instance, has more than the average # of airbags.

My wife is starting to consider replacing her '01 Elantra which she bought for $14K. Decently equipped '11 Elantras will be 20K or thereabouts and fully loaded ones are several thou more than that. As someone used to inexpensive cars (the '01 was her first bought-new car) she's definitely feeling the sticker shock.

Also, these are MSRPs we're talking about. Let the initial furor die down and street prices will hopefully be much more reasonable."
47,2010-11-23T21:15:37+00:00,ateixeira,"Wait for the new Elantra. Even the bigger Optima is around $21k with mid-levels of equipment.

Then just add a portable GPS, or get an iPhone 4 with a nice mount.

Tech gets old fast. If you look at residuals, loaded up models often depreciate more, because the technology ages quickly. Who would pay a bunch more for, say, and older Nissan Maxima with an outdated CD-based GPS? Not me."
48,2010-11-23T23:26:34+00:00,fushigi,"I buy the car I want to drive, not the car I want to sell.

Your point's valid, but is a minor influence over my buying decisions."
49,2010-11-24T14:44:00+00:00,ateixeira,"I guess it also depends on how long you plan to keep the car.

Check the residuals, you'll see what I mean. Ask car_man in the lease threads, he's an excellent resource."

1,2010-11-24T16:30:50+00:00,fushigi,"Since I started buying new cars I've not had one for less than 6 years.

People who buy new & trade in every 3 years or so take a financial beating regardless of the options they put on the car. Well, let me amend that. People who trade for a new car before or right after their current car is paid off take a financial beating. Perpetual payments & upside down loans are things to be avoided if at all possible.

My last car was bought with a 2 year loan. After paying it off I drive it for an additional 8.5 years. I can stay with a car that long because I option mine with everything available at the time that I might possibly want. A couple of grand extra in options nets me an added 3-5 years of content ownership; that's a bargain.

By buying the car I want to drive I'll want to drive it longer. Residuals mean little to me and with my ownership model I've already busted the myth of higher resale value justifying a higher purchase price."
2,2010-11-24T17:36:17+00:00,ateixeira,"I hear you, I'm a ""keeper"" as well.

91 Escort GT - 7 years, totalled
98 Forester - 9 years, sold
03 Miata - bought used, kept 7 years, sold
07 Sienna - still have it
08 Miata - still have it

I kept my '98 Forester so long it allowed me to buy a 2nd car (!).

But back to what started the discussion, the $25k Cruze....that's a huge investment in a small car.

Let's say your family grows, or your needs change and you need something that can tow, or you feel cramped in it after living with it for a while...those are pretty big risks you're taking.

It's different than spending the same amount (or more, even) on a Chevy Equinox, because the Equinox meets many more needs, and you're far less likely to need a bigger or more capable vehicle."

I officially don't need the room in my 04 Ody but it's almost paid for (bought CPO in 07) and at that point what was a car payment will buy a boatload of gas and the mileage is my biggest complaint on it.

I was in my SIL's van which is identical except for the exterior color. It has 225K on it. Mine has 76K. Neither has any issues. i'm thinking I will hang on to it for a long time."

Jeeze, I thought there were a lot of Subies in MA... Head up north and I swear every other vehicle is either an Outback of some generation or a Forester (mostly the older boxy ones). My wife and I should fit in fine up here...

Other notable spottings from yesterday afternoon's jaunt, a Panamera, newer Cayenne (Very nice redesign, lost a lot of the frumpiness), A slew of new Grand Cherokees, a few new Jettas, a new Scion tC and a redesigned CLS which I didn't even know existed yet...

On the ""unusual scale"" I saw none other than a Lamborghini LM001? I don't know the differences between an 001 and 002 but it was really interesting to see one of these beasts on the highway.

Only a couple of trips left but this spotting stuff makes the moving process more enjoyable that's for sure. :shades:"

It had been a while since I'd seen an SUV roll over, likely because of stability control systems that are now standard, so this was a bit shocking.

Those seems to be wider than they are tall, too.

Freaky.

Careful out there on the slush and ice. We only got about an inch, but it was slippery as heck. With zero traction no acronym will save you. VSC, TC, ABS, AWD all still mean SOL."

I followed a Kia Soul for a bit and thought it looks like a tiny armored car from that angle.

I also saw the first Ford Fiesta I've seen outside of an auto show. It looked a size bigger than a Mini but it's really not, @ least not inside. Oddly it was black rather than the neon/candy colors they show in ads."

To be honest I'm not sure which van I would buy today. None of them have a good 8th seat, the Sienna was cheapened, the Ody is ugly and you gotta spend over $40 grand to get the 6 speed. The Quest's cargo area falls 10"" short of fitting a sheet of plywood.

On the X3... I like the style of the new one, and the performance numbers... but they made it smaller than the outgoing model. Unfortunately, that puts is out for us. When wife drove the outgoing model, she said size was just borderline. Probably too small, but might live with it if she really loved driving it. She didn't.

It's a nice package... If you loaded up the turbo model (300 HP), it would be about $50K (without NAV). About $5K less for the NA model (240 HP). If you don't mind your luxury cars sans luxury, then you could easily knock $5K off those numbers and still have the same vehicle..

I was happy to see she looked great, clean and no dents.

Ever happen to anyone else, i.e. seeing a car you sold on the road?"
8,2011-01-04T15:25:47+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I've seen my wifes old 2002 Mercedes C230 hatch a few times since she traded it. I can spot it because the dealer she bought it from has a big ol dealer sticker that sits inside the lower corner of the window and was probably a huge PAI to remove so they left it.

Still looks great, no dents and well maintained. :shades:"
9,2011-01-04T15:31:38+00:00,ateixeira,"A while back I saw my 98 Forester on the road, it is easy to spot because it had custom wheels (so did the 02 Legacy).

It was FILTHY!

Buyer has no shame at all. I was so sad...."
10,2011-01-04T17:08:49+00:00,qbrozen,"I have to wonder why Hyundai has so many damned different model sedans. I mean, do they really need 4? (accent, elantra, sonata, and genesis.)

Does any other manufacturer offer that many? Honda = 2, I believe. Toyota = 3, Mazda = 2, BMW = 3, Benz = 3, Acura = 3 .....

They should probably at least eliminate the Accent sedan. I thought the new sonata would eliminate the elantra ... guess I was wrong."
11,2011-01-04T17:17:09+00:00,texases,"Well, Toyota has Yaris/Corolla/Camry/Avalon, right?"
12,2011-01-04T17:23:43+00:00,qbrozen,"I always forget about the Avalon.

BUT, ya know what? I even left off a couple of Hyundais! The also have the Equus and the Azera!! Good grief.

And to add to the silliness, the Accent is only a grand less than the Elantra."
13,2011-01-04T17:29:10+00:00,texases,"You're right, that's a lot. But I might claim the Genesis and Equus would be in their Lexus/Inifinti lines, if they had one. Instead of the current Kia/Hyundai setup, they need a Hyundai/premium brand split. What's the real difference between a Kia and a Hyundai, anyway?"
14,2011-01-04T17:31:30+00:00,qbrozen,"I really have no idea. I do know, though, cause I was just looking yesterday, that the lower-end Kia SUV (I think its the Sorento??) has 3 rows, while you have to step all the way up to the top Hyundai to get that. Something like $8k difference. I don't know what that means, or why they did it, but there ya go. I also think the Kia SUVs are better looking than the Hyundais at the moment."
15,2011-01-04T17:34:06+00:00,ateixeira,"Hyundai was supposed to move upscale, while Kia was the sportier brand. That move has just begun so we don't really see the result of that strategy yet, except perhaps the Genesis and Equus.

I don't think they need an Accent sedan, I imagine the hatch sells better anyway. But it is B segment, and the Elantra is C segment. The Sonata is nearly a full-sizer.

The most redundant sedan is probably the Azera. The Genesis sort of fills the niche that the Azera was supposed to fill anyway.

The Equus is a flagship and IMHO plenty differentiated - check out the rear recliners."
16,2011-01-04T17:59:44+00:00,fintail,"Well technically in 4 door cars, MB has the A/B/C/E/S/CLS, just not all in this market. BMW and Audi also have more, just not for here.

That being said, nobody would mourn the loss of the Accent sedan...I can't imagine why anyone would buy one."
17,2011-01-04T18:00:26+00:00,fintail,"Equus also has the weirdest/dumpiest KDM styling :shades:

Rear recliners? Boring, W126 had that 30 years ago."
18,2011-01-04T18:18:11+00:00,texases,"""Hyundai was supposed to move upscale, while Kia was the sportier brand.""

Well, I'd like to be 30 again, but that ain't happening, either! I do like many recent Kias from the styling dept., but there seems to be about 90% overlap with the corresponding Hyundai models."
19,2011-01-04T18:38:03+00:00,stever,"Currently Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 40% of Kia. Still controls it with that percentage. I don't see much info about platform sharing and the like off-hand - anyone know? I think Kia was really hoping that Ford would bail them out when they went banko in 1997 but the Korean government made them go with Hyundai.

Kia seems to be focusing on European sales more than Hyundai. They hired German Peter Schreyer of Audi fame as Chief Design Officer four or five years ago."
20,2011-01-04T18:56:15+00:00,ateixeira,"A- and B- are 5 doors, though, and don't even resemble sedans.

21,2011-01-04T18:57:47+00:00,ateixeira,"Rear recliners?

You're taking my comments out of context.

The point is the Equus is distinct from the Genesis.

The current Equus is an older KDM design. I'm betting the next generation will look (and be) a lot better."
22,2011-01-04T18:59:20+00:00,ateixeira,"Several cars share platforms, off the top of my head:

Sonata/Optima
Tucson/Sportage

To be fair they look nothing like one another."
23,2011-01-04T19:09:39+00:00,stever,Thanks Juice. I still have this nagging feeling that Kia and Hyundai hate each other.

25,2011-01-04T19:24:19+00:00,fintail,"Yes, it is ""distinct"" alright.

Could it look anything but better? I see H kind of has an unintended strategy...""wait til the next one""...not very smooth."
26,2011-01-04T19:25:12+00:00,fintail,"Heh...well, 4 door Accent is barely a sedan either :shades:

I'm surprised the B hasn't been brought to the US...they sell in Canada.

AMG or diesel is the only way I'd go."
27,2011-01-04T19:51:21+00:00,ateixeira,"I'm looking forward to seeing the fluidic-sculpture-ized next-gen Equus. And yes, I know you're not a fan.

Kia has Schreyer (from Audi) so they have nowhere to go but up."
28,2011-01-04T19:52:33+00:00,ateixeira,"They sell the B-class in Brazil, come to think of it the A-class as well.

I say bring the B, ditch the A.

The R-class is so expensive Mercedes doesn't really have an affordable people mover. The GLK is too small, and I'm not sure I'd call the ML affordable."
29,2011-01-04T20:01:39+00:00,fintail,"I envision it looking like an Infiniti M...which is no beauty queen in my eyes either.

I'll hold that the Optima looks better than the Sonata."
30,2011-01-04T20:02:58+00:00,fintail,"We don't need the A here, and I can't imagine it coming. But the B could work, especially with some kind of atypical (diesel or hybrid, or both) powertrain.

I am surprised the R is still around, but at least it exists as a diesel."
31,2011-01-04T21:25:04+00:00,stickguy,"doesn't every maker pretty much have this now? Ford, Nissan, even BMW.

a few might not be straight 4 door sedans, but they are distinct sizes and market segments.

Honda does too if you count the fit, and Acura!"
32,2011-01-05T02:53:23+00:00,qbrozen,"That's just it, though, the Fit is distinguised by being a hatchback. They aren't canibalizing their own sales with it. Several manufacturers have specialty models like that. Like BMW's 1 series and Audi's A3 (just to name a couple). So if the Accent was hatchback only, it would make more sense.

As for the luxo brands, they are just that, more luxo. So the TL and Accord aren't different sizes... just outfitted differently. I don't think 4 lines of sedans is all that common. And now that we've added it up, Hyundai even has 6."
33,2011-01-05T03:37:20+00:00,stickguy,"Ford: Fiesta, focus, fusion, taurus. And formerly Crown Vic.
nissan: Venza, Sentra (that seems really cannibalistic), altima, maxima
Hyundai, covered. Will be interesting to see how accent hurts elantra.
Toyota: they got 4."
34,2011-01-05T15:56:38+00:00,qbrozen,"Right. But I believe (without looking at ALL of them) that there are far more manufacturers with less than 4. And even if we set 4 as the far end of the bell curve, Hyundai is still an anomaly with 6."
35,2011-01-05T17:57:36+00:00,stickguy,"chevy should be on the list too.

And there really aren't that many more ""big"" makers that have that broad of a product line.

Hyundai though is unique in that they don't have a premium line. If you take Ford and add lincoln, they have more.Toyota/Lexus, etc.

I don't see the problem, as long as they are distinct in some way (size/purpose/cost/market niche)

Accent/elantra (like Nissan with Venza/Sentra) are the only ones that seem to overlap enough to maybe be redundant. But the accent is smaller/strippier/cheaper, but i guess the same thing could be accomplished with a strippo (smaller engine) Elantra.

Equis is off by itself trying to be a Lexus lS. and like Lexus with the GS and ES, the Azerra (which probably goes away soon) and Genny are aimed at different buyers, although they are roughly the same size and price (V6 at least).

Interesting, my friend that works for Hyundai corporate (and the reason I always saw the new stuff months before everyone else!) really liked the Azerra better than the Genny. Guess he liked the smooth, plushy ride."
36,2011-01-05T18:04:19+00:00,ateixeira,"Also, the Azera follows the new design language.

With the Genesis, Hyundai was still gun shy, uncommitted."
37,2011-01-05T19:57:20+00:00,fezo,"Count me in with the folks who think the new Optima looks better than the Sonata - and I like the Sonata.

Four word answer to why they still make 4 door Accents - Enterprise Rent A Car. Had one a year or so ago. Stripper that you could probably buy with pocket change. Even had window cranks."
38,2011-01-05T20:06:06+00:00,stickguy,"price is big. even though there is not that much real-world difference in size or performance, having the Accent lets Hyundai have a super cheap strippo model, without have to decontent the heck out of the Elantra. Plus, they can start with a better, more expensive platform if they want to.

I also like the Optima better. just looks better to me, and I am not a fan of the ultra swoopy styling on a family car. I don't care for the MB CLS either. Must be my Volvo 144 roots showing."
39,2011-01-05T20:09:50+00:00,ateixeira,"I actually prefer the styling on the Sonata, but the Optima's options packages let me configure one much more to my liking. They don't package the tech stuff with pricey models like Hyundai does.

I'd like to see a manual in the 2.0T models, though."
40,2011-01-05T20:11:17+00:00,fezo,"Must be my Volvo 144 roots showing.

I had forgotten that! Mine was a 142 - not because I wanted two doors but when you buy used you give up some choices.

I want to see the new Elantra up close. I'm enough of a cheapskate to really like that."
41,2011-01-05T20:14:29+00:00,ateixeira,"At 40mpg you would be driving for a couple of weeks between fill-ups, too.

How big is its gas tank?

I care more about range than actual mileage, so if the 33mpg Optima turbo has a big enough tank to even things out, I'd still, well, Opt for the Optima."
42,2011-01-05T20:19:03+00:00,stickguy,"I beleive the optima is 16 or 16 gals. About the same as everything else in the class (my 2005 accord is 16.9 IIRC).

the Elantra they downsized with the new model to ~12gals. Too small IMO, since if you are doing more local stuff and dropping the miles down to say 30, your range gets cut pretty low (I won't go below 1/4 of a tank if I can help it, and usually try to fill at around 1/3, so that only leaves 8-9 gals to use).

nothing can be as bad as my Opel was. partly do to a screwed up FI system, I only got about 20 (on the highway!) with that POC. and it only had a 10 gal tank, so you didn't go very far on a trip without stopping"
43,2011-01-05T20:23:20+00:00,fezo,"Dang! That's one short cruising range!

I wonder if Hyundai will redo the Elantra Touring any time soon. Wagons are hard to come by anymore."
44,2011-01-05T20:28:54+00:00,stickguy,"I do like the touring. I seem to recall hearing that they will be coming out with a replacement shortly (maybe in a year, if that long) for it based on the new platform (the current model was not based on the outgoing Elantra we got, rather on some Euro version).

Hopefully they keep the relatively boxy rear, instead of making it all swoopy and low slung. Wouldn't want my dod to bump his head (at this point, he is the primary reaosn I want a wagon, since this would be too small to serve as the family truckster)."
45,2011-01-05T20:35:53+00:00,ateixeira,"I *hate* when they downsize the gas tanks for fuel efficient models. The increase range would be the best part!

I think the Camry has a fairly big gas tank, less so on the hybrid. The Altima also. A 2.5 CVT Altima can go quite a ways on a single gas tank."
46,2011-01-05T21:28:07+00:00,tifighter,"It will be updated. Into a 5-door hatch, not wagon..."
47,2011-01-05T21:44:49+00:00,qbrozen,"I couldn't agree more. Just about every car I've had has provided a range under 400 miles, regardless of its efficiency, thanks to the tank size.

Only standouts were my 300Z and S70. Both got mileage in the mid 20s with an 18-19 gallon tank, so 450-500 was more common with those."
48,2011-01-06T01:54:52+00:00,stever,"I will be updated. Into a 5-door hatch, not wagon

That's too bad (unless maybe it's a big hatch). They'll probably de-content it too."
49,2011-01-06T18:08:34+00:00,ateixeira,"Funny thing is it's called i30 in other markets, so it's not even really an Elantra wagon.

They may do a bigger touring based on the Sonata - hopefully it comes here with DI and a 6 speed manual."

But if it allows one to coin some new jingo, so be it. I do notice ""sculpture"" was left off that website...that's good."

12,2011-01-07T17:29:19+00:00,ateixeira,"I agree, actually. One auto scribe called it Toyota's weakest product.

I actually wanted a 4 seat convertible, but the Solara and Sebring were just such awful drivers that I ended up with a 2nd Miata. Guess I could have gone with a CPO 3er hard top, but prices were still quite high and HPFP issues scared me away.

To be fair, the G6 was worse than the Solara. You actually heard the structure creaking and felt the cowl shake. The Chrysler PT Cruiser convertible actually had the best back seat the interior quality was awful and it just didn't drive that well. Eos and Volvo C70 too expensive and questionable reliability history, so I gave up.

It worked out OK - even though I have 2 kids, they each have their own activities, and they love it when I pick them up with the PRHT. :shades:"
13,2011-01-07T18:52:45+00:00,fintail,"I'd imagine the Solara would have some rigidity issues too - of course the typical owner would never notice. I am shocked it lived on as long as it did - it's beige even for the beigest brand.

You could have gone with an SC if you also wanted a car shaped like a football...kids could fit in the back, and they are probably reliable."
14,2011-01-07T19:18:30+00:00,stickguy,"I love that i40. exactly the type of car I would be looking at for myself (probably too small for family truckster dty).

Is that a wagon version of the Sonata platform, or based on something we don't get? Looks to be about that size.

wonder what the upcoming Touring replacement will look like? Probably similar to this, so less functinal than the current model."
15,2011-01-07T19:28:08+00:00,ateixeira,"SC430 was too pricey and didn't hit my fuel economy targets (16mpg city on premium, ouch) for what is basically my city commuter car. Back seat is actually useless, too.

Solara's suspension is soft enough that I doubt anyone notices any rigidity issues.

I checked out a 128i convertible but the back seat was pretty useless and I didn't want another soft top, and the 328i hard top was new, so it was also expensive.

Sky/Solistice had the worst folding top design in history. You had to get out of the car, and folded away it took up the entire trunk.

Miata won easily. In fact nothing came in 2nd. My alternative was to not buy a car at all.

Don't laugh, we went car shopping with my wife and she had to choose between a 325i sedan and a condo at the beach.

We chose the latter. :shades:"
16,2011-01-07T19:29:30+00:00,ateixeira,"Supposedly the i30 is not Elantra-based, so I would not be surprised if this i40 is not really a Sonata wagon, either, but I'm not sure.

I always remember reading reports that claimed the same thing for the Solara. Seems to me back then, even when the universe thought Toyota walked on water, Consumer Reports' owner surveys only gave the Solara an ""average"" reliability rating...same as a Cavalier at that time (gasp!)

I could never stop being reminded of the ""Polara"" whenever I saw that big chrome ""Solara"" script on the middle of the decklid in front of me."

39,2011-01-14T04:29:41+00:00,andys120,I saw my first Caddy CTS station wagon outside of an auto show. Nice rig! Metallic red like the ones in all the ads.

42,2011-01-14T15:27:51+00:00,ateixeira,"New Bimmer in the garage. I feel mixed - less controversial than the Dame Edna predecessor, but not attractive either. OK for what it is, I suppose - understated.

Also saw a new Touareg. I think this is the model that wears the VW corporate grille the best. The sedans with the same grill look boring, but this looks OK.

Finally, saw my first non-tinted window Sienna. Must have been the rare 4 cylinder/base model."
43,2011-01-14T17:18:10+00:00,fintail,"I loathe the Dame Edna so much, inside and outside, that the new one is wonderful just because it is mellow. BMW has never been about groundbreaking design - at least not until Bangle came along and messed around.

550i wouldn't be the one I would choose...the options list on the 5er is insane (70K is easy) and a stupid buy new unless you love burning money...but they do have awesome seats."

Howzabout a '98 with those miles for $10k asking?

At least the asking price is $1500 less than the other one

Or how about a few more miles but 2 years younger?

and yes, the Odyssey is more hideous with every one I see. It looks particularly bad in Black, so of course, I keep seeing black ones!

I don't get that hung up on styling (more concerned with the interior and driving dynamics), but even I have some standards, and this I would never buy (although easy for me to say, since we want to downsize from a van anyway)."

It also bothers me that Honda puts ""28mpg"" in every ad I've seen, yet that's only the $40k plus Touring models, as most get the lesser 5 speed automatic and an EPA combined 21 mpg."

48,2011-01-25T15:31:01+00:00,ateixeira,"For sure the Ody/Sienna left the door open for competitors.

Honda kept the 6 speed out of their volume models and beat the exterior with the ugly stick.

Toyota cut costs inside, I swear my 2007 is much nicer. The 8th seat isn't as good, either, my favorite feature from the 2010.

The Quest looks interesting but specs put the cargo floor at a good 10"" shy of fitting a sheet of plywood, so I'm wondering if it's smaller than the class leaders.

Dodge put in a decent engine and a nicer interior, so it's worth a 2nd look.

Kia also put in a massively upgraded engine, though I'd like to see the new Kia re-do the whole van, and come up with a Sonata-like home run."

The Z4 is RWD but fairly heavy for what it is, Edmund's quotes a curb weight of 3252 lbs, more than half a ton over the lightweight RWD 2000 roadsters of the 60s and 70s which were actually great fun to drive in bad conditions because they had good brakes, excellent weight balance and precise steering and it only takes one passenger to push out of a snowbank.

The good thing about bad weather.... most people are moving slower, so resulting impacts would be less severe.. And, most of those SUVs are sliding off the road... lol.."
9,2011-01-29T20:59:49+00:00,ateixeira,"Some random thoughts...

Miata ain't as small as it used to be, and my new one has side curtain airbags at least.

In the dry I can take evasive maneuvers, on ice you're helpless.

Also, in dry, people aren't skidding around helplessly and driving too fast for conditions with overconfident 4WD vehicles.

Knock on wood, the new Miata has been OK. My old NA one, even in bright white, was a crash magnet. I was hit 3 times, I think. It was like I had a bulls' eye target on it or something."

15,2011-02-01T16:20:17+00:00,ateixeira,"It was cool to see a lot of new cars. Some observations:

Fiat is indeed having a good influence on Chrysler. While the interiors have improved, there is still even more room for improvement. They went from a D to a B-, C+ for some models.

Example: the Jeep Compass got a few soft-touch upgrades in the front cabin, but the rear seat has the same old hard plastic, and it mis-matches the front. Hello, compromise!

Grand Cherokee did not disappoint, but the soft leather in the Overland were wearing out already, and the GPS screen is small for $46,000. Love the panoramic moonroof. 20"" rims are ridiculous and kill the Trail-Rated badge. Also sat in a $38k V6 model that was not as nice, but after seeing a $54k Touareg that price doesn't seem so high any more.

Durango was also there, same small GPS screen. Nicer than the Explorer, IMHO. A loaded Citadel AWD with 20""s was $47,000, though. Yikes. Didn't that get you a Navigator or Escalade not too long ago? Sticker shock!

Charger RT Road & Track edition was nice. I still bump my head getting in the rear seat, and feel claustrophobic in a huge car, which shouldn't be the case. $40k loaded up didn't seem bad, and they start at $30k.

Grand Caravan got upgraded, too, but it went from being Rubber-Maid cheap to being merely cheap. The new Quest and Ody are still nicer. The Sienna materials are on par, but the design is better. Don't like all the vinyl - seems like even ""leather"" seats are 99% vinyl with a tiny leather insert in the middle. The top-of-the-line Town & Country had a nicer suede-like material, at least.

Fiat 500 had lines to get in. People were loving it. So did I, actually. Tons of character. IMHO better ergonomics than a MINI and they cost a bunch less. Some cheap touches inside, back seat is tiny, and the driver gets an armrest while the passenger does not, even with a stick shift, which is ... odd.

Still, the 500 simply OOZES character. It had longer lines than any Porsche.

Volvo S60 was ho-hum. Interior already looks dated. I did like the brushed nickel, but not much else.

Touareg was nice, but $54,000? Seriously? And that's with no low range, no air suspension from the Euro models. The price is a joke. It is quite nice, but so is a Jetta sport wagon TDI and a loaded one was there for $28k.

Loved the old Jetta TDI, hated the new base Jetta. They scream cheap. Steering wheel is that econobox plastic that begs for an aftermarket cover. VW sold their soul, this car simply does not fit within their lineup.

New Passat not as bad. Higher prices mean the cost cutting didn't go as deep.

Nissan Quest - interior of this seems more SUV and less minivan. Strange. All seats fold forward. This means you keep the well behind the 3rd row all the time, but the 3rd row itself is tiny, not adult-sized like competitors. Floor is higher, too. Folding the 2nd row leaves holes and gaps, an odd arrangement, but easy to use at least. Materials were a mixed bag, soft but still cheap looking. Cargo floor is not nearly as long as 4'x8' fitting competitors. Cup holders cannot accommodate mugs, not even one. Peach fuzz headliner and visors scream cheap. Vinyl arm rests also but the angles all adjust. Some double-stitching looks nice. Little storage. Overall a B-, could have been better with a little more thoughtful design."
16,2011-02-01T16:24:24+00:00,ateixeira,"Sat in one of these for the first time. They're quite nice, sit in one before you judge from the badge.

The headliner is a beautiful, soft microfiber suede material that exceed any and all expectations.

*Everything* you touch is soft leather, real wood, or suede. All nicely finished, padded, double-stitched.

It's not just a limo, it's a NICE limo. Puts the Town Car to shame, seriously.

I realize lots of badge snobs won't give it a chance, but IMHO that's their loss!"

Here is an example of what I believe (and recommended on a couple of occassions to Subie staff at auto shows and those owner surveys they send out) to be a real opportunity for Subaru, an MPV type vehicle. Not to take discount the safety, utility or success of the competition, but right now the only one who offers an AWD MPV is Toyota. Add Subarus stellar safety reputation and that ""family oriented"" type marketing theme and I think a minivan would be a really smart addition to the lineup.

I also think this would be a good addition for Volvo as well, but they are in the middle of cutting their lineup so..."

30,2011-02-11T12:57:39+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Actually that bed extender was a dealer installed, aftermarket option that you could get on other trucks from the Nissan Frontier to the Ford Explorer Sport. It was more function over form and could be rotated 180 degrees back into the bed so you could close the tailgate. Pretty cool idea IMO.

Another feature that helped expand the bed space in the Baja was the folding rear panel behind the seats, opening the load floor into the cabin. The same feature found in the Chevy Avalanche and Cadillac Escalade EXT. Of course, Subie was partially owned by Government Motors at the time :sick: which is why it made it into the Baja.

Neat feature, I've read a couple of water leak issues but nothing widespread."
31,2011-02-11T14:12:59+00:00,ateixeira,"Another feature that helped expand the bed space in the Baja was the folding rear panel behind the seats, opening the load floor into the cabin

It was more of a pass-through, much smaller than the mid-gate style opening in the Avalanche.

The ST-X concept had it. Subaru had the right idea. It had a supercharger, too.

Instead they cut costs and gave us a naturally aspirated 2.5l only, and made it a 4 seater, with leather standard to bump the price way up, and topped it off with a headroom-robbing moonroof. The cherry on top was a high price mandated by the unnecessary equipment.

Subaru fixed the packaging and equipment levels and even added a turbo, but it was too late. And the midgate never arrived.

Decent idea, terrible execution."
32,2011-02-11T14:34:20+00:00,fintail,"That bed extender just always irked me with the metal railings - dorky looking.

Funny thing, IMO if Ford and GM would bring over their Aussie car-based pickups, they'd sell."
33,2011-02-11T15:08:09+00:00,ateixeira,"The Utes, yes, and let's remember they were federalized here - Pontiac GTO and G8 were on the same platforms.

It wouldn't have taken much...

Perhaps they're afraid those would cannibalize more profitable pickups?

There was an oddball concept back from the GM/Subaru partnership days, called the Chevy Borrego. It was a 2 seat pickup based on the WRX. Probably too small for American tastes, but imagine how much fun that would be.

Chevy said it would not sell for a higher price than a WRX, but then the simple question became, why not try to sell it for a little less?"
34,2011-02-11T15:28:11+00:00,fintail,"Build em here too...probably increase profit margins a little and keep factories rolling. It might cannibalize some truck sales yes, but in the long term might work better as gas prices rise and people realize they can't use a 1 ton truck as a commuter rig, when the Ute style will do the same work. Whatever they do, a 4 door Ute doesn't work. Ford and GM have successful designs for this segment already.

Selling it for less is part of the equation the suits don't seem to get - to make a comeback, you have to be better and at a better price. Only meeting one or the other will give you partial success if you are lucky."
35,2011-02-11T16:26:28+00:00,ateixeira,"Perhaps the imports will realize this first, and enter that segment?

It's not like Nissan sells many Titans. Maybe they should try a ute.

Nissan seems to be going after small niches - look at the Juke (actually don't look, it might hurt your eyes) and the Murano CrossCabriolet.

I find it hard to believe a Ute would not outsell those, especially the CrossCabrio."
36,2011-02-11T20:53:51+00:00,andys120,"I read the other day that the new Porsche 4-door is outselling 911s and has become the best-selling Porsche despite a general consensus that is ugly. I for one do not agree and my opinion was reinforced when I watched a black Panamera S pull up to an airport curb to make a pick up yesterday.

IMO it looked great and very distinctive. Me want bad!

It was perhaps the second that I've seen outside of a dealer or auto show."
37,2011-02-11T21:18:26+00:00,ateixeira,"From the front, maybe...

Or at night, pitch dark, if it's black and its lights are off. Then it might not bother me.

Top Gear said it looked like a bloated corpse that had sat at the bottom of a lake, and the Maserati they compared it to looked like the car that put it there. LOL"
38,2011-02-11T21:35:41+00:00,fintail,"I don't know if they have the creativity to think of it and do it properly (the Baja was executed poorly).

Cross Cabrio has to be the worst new idea out there - I can't wait to see one on the road. Might take awhile. I will have to question the mental capacity of anyone who blows the chunk of change necessary to buy one.

Panamera isn't bad from the front half, but the rear views are really unsightly."

42,2011-02-13T21:41:52+00:00,berri,"Just got back from visiting in Chicago this week and had a chance to check out the auto show Friday. Of course in Chicago fashion they gouge you $20 to park and admission was $11 probably due to their 10% sales tax. Here are a few quick impressions:

Ford seems ahead of the domestics. The new Focus looks nicely put together and the Explorer is a winner. The only issue I saw was the glass cockpit. I&#146;ve got to think it can be a bit distracting and more effort than simply turning a button or knob. Hate to think what it will cost to repair. Chrysler really did improve their interiors. I don&#146;t know if any of the mechanicals besides the Pentastar engine were changed to improve reliability, so can&#146;t tell if the new interiors are just lipstick on a pig yet. GM seemed a bit behind and dated except for some of the newer vehicles. I liked that new Cadillac coupe (can&#146;t recall its name because they use those mumbo jumbo letter names like Lincoln does) but when I opened it up I was dismayed at the hard, shiny leather that seemed to have a vinyl quality to it. I thought the LaCrosse had much nicer, softer leather. Speaking of luxury, I don&#146;t know how the Lincoln dealers are going to be able to hold on a few more years while Ford resurrects the brand. Most looked like Ford&#146;s with gaudy front and rear end clips &#150; kind of like the family Truckster design in the movie Vacation. I expect big incentives.

As for imports, the Koreans are really stepping it up. VW seems to be emulating Toyota with blah, generic styling for the masses. Minivans seem hot in the press these days and the Nissan Quest was interesting. Looks like a refrigerator from the rear, but it had a very comfortable, roomy driver&#146;s seat. It trades utility for convenience in the back. The Honda Odyssey still looks like it got rear ended sending the back of it up and in. It also appears to have given up some driver&#146;s space. I own a Toyota, but I&#146;ve got to admit their entire lineup mostly looks dated and frumpy now with cheap interiors. The Sienna may have swagger on the outside, but the acres of plastic inside look chintzy and designed by Whirlpool from obsolete bisque colored appliances."
43,2011-02-14T18:20:17+00:00,ateixeira,"Had one following me today, spotted the huge grille in my rear view mirror.

We also checked one out at the Baltimore Auto Show.

I compared to the new Durango, and it seems Ford does some things better (big screen for starters) while Dodge does some things better (high end models seem slightly more upscale).

Both were close to $50 grand, Yikes! Not far from the Land Rover LR4.

While I wouldn't want to own that Land Rover past warranty, it's not a big step up in terms of price any more."
44,2011-02-14T18:28:36+00:00,ateixeira,"Chrysler made improvements, but there are still signs of cost cutting - for example the Jeep Compass got soft touch plastic on the front doors but not the rear. So they mismatch. That's almost worse than before, where plastics were hard but at least the front and rear matched.

The Dodge vans still aren't up to par with the best in that segment, despite the best not being as nice as before. I swear our 2007 van is nicer than any new one sold today.

Caddy CTS-V coupe is gorgeous, but I'll take a wagon.

Lincoln is non even on the radar. No one in my family even wanted to look at any of those. Edge Sport > MKX, Taurus SHO > MKS, Fusion Sport > MKZ, so it's simply redundant.

I liked the Quest, too, but I was outvoted 3 to 1 against it. Interior is smaller than the best vans out there, gives up about 40 cubic feet, which is a lot to the large families they appeal to.

Ody is probably my fave, with the best 8 seat configuration, too. But you're stuck with a 5EAT when everyone else gets 6 gears, and not much HP either.

The new Sienna lost many of the soft-touch plastics from my 2007 model, and the 8th seat went from a nice adult-sized seat to a teeny little bridge that is no longer comfy. Bummer.

In terms of interior material quality, I picked Honda first, Nissan probably 2nd. The rest lag way behind, including Kia. Kia put the nice engine in there but it's time for a re-do.

Honestly we looked at every van and all 4 of us unanimously agreed our 2007 van is nicer than anything sold today."
45,2011-02-14T19:08:48+00:00,stickguy,"You were at Philly, right? I went wife my wife (she is starting the looking process to eventually replace her 2005 odyssey).

The only reason we even went through the Chrysler display was so I could see the Fiat 500. I want one bad. Wife thinks I am insane (nothing really new there I guess). Other than that, nothing to interest us, and as she said ""it's a chrysler"" And not in a complimentary way.

of course, she had the same preconcieved negative opinion of Ford, until I told her that they had some of the best stuff. She actually really liked the edge, except for the grill. hates the ford family front. And the explorer we both considered to be a barge. way too big, especially when downsizing from a minivan!

The Ody, other than the hideous styling, was otherwise pretty much the same as our. Updated here and there, but obvious what it was.

I did like the Nissan. Still had plenty of room. And keep in mind then the seats are folded down, you still have the well available, which is a nice touch. especially when it is full, and you want to flop the rear seats!

we are looking mid size. She does have good taste. Favorites were the Audi A5, Volvo XC60, BMW X3, and Porsche Cayanne. The Edge and Hyundai santa fe also made the list (the santa fe, to me, was especially nice and had great bang for the buck. But I did love the new X3)"

49,2011-02-14T20:43:02+00:00,ateixeira,"I went to the Philly show with rsholland last Monday. We're both AWD enthusiasts and really wanted to see the Impreza Concept. As you probably know, Philly is Subaru's ""home"" auto show, being closest to SoA HQ.

I went again yesterday with the family, this time to the Baltimore Auto Show. We tend to check out convertibles, for fun, and minivans, to meet our needs.

We all liked the Wrangler 4 door, though I'm still not convinced it is refined enough to truly live with long-term.

Most other convertibles have miserable back seats, the kids kept complaining.

They absolutely loved ... drum roll please ... the Hyundai Equus. A refrigerator in the back plus a screen for each of them and an iPad in the glove box surely helped. Plus kids don't have the same brand snobbery that adults have, so the Hyundai name doesn't put them off one bit.

I looked closely at the 500 at Philly, but didn't see it at all in Baltimore. I loved it, BTW.

Explorer does seem big. Wife said she could not daily drive something that bulky.

I wanted to like the Kia Sorento more, but it was juuuu-ust a tad too small to replace our van. Great value, though.

I honestly like your Ody better than the new one. Only the 8th seat improved, really. Some things went down hill.

I liked the well in the Nissan, too, but max carrying capacity is down, and the 3rd row seats are not adult sized. It feels more like a large SUV than a minivan. Not sure why they did that.

I like the XC60, the X3 is small, no? Santa Fe is dated, why not a Sorento?

Baltimore show was more crowded than Philly by far, then again it was the last day and on a weekend."
0,2011-02-14T21:01:37+00:00,stickguy,"I've ben to Sube HQ. a friend of mine is an executive with them. I did see the outback concept at the show. serious looking piece.

and Nissan has always done their own thing with the Quest. Probably intentional trying to make people think ""SUV"". still, it seemed plenty big inside to me, unless you really need a school bus or a Sprinter van.

The Sorrento is nice too. Santa fe though seemed a little bigger.

the X3 seems to have grown a bit. Did not seem small to me. Probably about the same as the XC60, and a little more boxy. But, we are down to 1 kid at home (who likes to remind me that she can drive in 9 months), and she is on the petite side, so we really don't need anything gigantic.

good point about the equis (sp?) It often takes the next generation (today's kids?) to move past the older generations bias. Look at the Japanese car revolution in the 70s/80s. It was the younger folks with no alligence to the 50's buying them!"
1,2011-02-14T21:17:23+00:00,ateixeira,"Good point - Quest has always marched to the beat of its own drummer.

And it's not obscure the way a Juke is, for instance.

I have not sat in the new X3. I prefer the nose on the X1, but that's not here yet. What does the X3 cost nowadays?

My kids are still young, so flashy paint jobs and vinyl stickers grab their attention. But it's nice to see a nice, low key sedan can do the same thing by coddling their every desire."
2,2011-02-14T21:21:58+00:00,stever,"Quest has always marched to the beat of its own drummer.

Mine's pretty ordinary. The first and second generations were all pretty tame versions of a Caravan imo. The track system for sliding the seats around is sort of cool, but surely isn't particularly innovative."
3,2011-02-14T21:46:52+00:00,stickguy,"X3 is about the same. Starts close to 40, and climbs fast if you tick the options boxes. Although I actually prefer the base (2.8) model, and don't want most of the super expensive techno goodies.

the quest? Steve is right that the first 2 were not controversial, but they still were zagging a bit while the big boys zigged. Always mama bear sized, did seats their own way, had loaded up models when others didn't, stuff like that.

the 3rd gen was where they totally went into bizarro land. My wife, who knows nothing about cars (and cares even less), when I pointed out they had redesigned the Quest, asked if it still had the stupid center mounted gauges. She actually remembered that from 2004 when we sat in one at the dealer (never even drove it)."

$11 admission for a full day's access to over a million square feet of displays with multiple test tracks. That's gouging? Considering people pay that for a cruddy 90 minute movie IMO you should rethink your pricing criticism.

Regarding the parking, while I also dislike $20 parking, it's been that way for some time. Chicago city lots run anywhere from $14-23 for 12 hours depending on time & location. Anyway, find any major city with parking adjacent to a major downtown venue and the parking rate will be similar.

My wife & I scored free tickets last year via a Mitsubishi Facebook contest. No such luck this year so we'll go Wednesday. The show is running a food drive for a local food bank so admission is $7 with 3 canned goods."

Good idea - you avoid the high-pressure fuel pump issues they've had with the turbo engines.

BMW replaced the ones that fail, but not proactively. So you could end up stranded before they'll fix it.

Tickets to the show were free, from a friend who works at Subaru - thanks Patti!

In Baltimore I did even better - wife got $5 tickets from Groupons, then I found free street parking since we went on a Sunday.

Auto Shows are an excellent way to sample a bunch of cars back-to-back with no sales pressure. Beats going to a dealer any day. You can narrow your choices down to a short list, and then maybe test drive your 3 faves."

I'm shopping for a minivan rental for next month, in Tampa. I got quotes for 4 days in an Uplander: $220. Sienna: $630!

SIX HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS? What the?!

Date was Sept 2007, and it was actually in Tampa. That was for 4 days, too, not a week."
30,2011-02-17T16:40:42+00:00,fintail,"Was this the same company? I might have misssed it.

Over $150/day for a Sienna, lunacy. I can easily rent a 7er/S/A8 or SL/6er/CL for that kind of money in Europe."

We ended up getting an Accord from the airport. We had been debating whether to share a minivan with friends (we went for a wedding), but decided to fly solo.

33,2011-02-17T17:38:59+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, the sedan was cheaper than the minivan, which is why I got it. So I'm sure we paid maybe $40 a day or so."

No kidding - his maintenance costs were cut in half.

Fleet managers aren't dumb. Corolla is 5-star rated by ALG for resale, a Chrysler PT Cruiser gets just one star:

38,2011-02-19T01:39:14+00:00,berri,"Fleet managers aren't dumb...

and that's why Hertz loaded up with Toyota's during the SUA fiasco!"
39,2011-02-20T02:31:50+00:00,fintail,"Saw another new QX today, this one not a Hertz prestige model. Man that thing is heinous, visual pollution."
40,2011-02-20T15:57:53+00:00,kyfdx,Yeah.. saw it up close at the car show... eeeewwwwww
41,2011-02-20T18:21:25+00:00,fezo,"OK, not a new car sighting but one that I absolutely thought was permanently in the past - someone parked in our lot at work in an Excel! It was actually in nice shape considering its age but I just can't imagine anyone doing that to themselves!"
42,2011-02-21T01:15:29+00:00,ateixeira,"SX4 manual AWD hatch - and get this - someone CRASHED into us! With dealer plates, about 200 feet from the dealership. Guy tried to pass us on the left when we were turning left, oops!

Basically took the front end off the car - bumper, hood, quarter panel, headlight. We limped it back to the dealer and they are dealing with the at-fault guy who his us directly.

Funny thing was it was the only manual SX4 in the area, but my brother deemed it too small anyway. He's shopping for a car to replace his totalled 2004 Legacy (plus he hit a deer last month - that's 3 crashes!).

Next: Sportage FWD manual, base. I wish you could get more options with a manual, because we both liked it even more than we thought we would. Blind spots are bad, but otherwise a solid vehicle all around, at an unbelievable $19.2k!

Next: Optima manual. A little too softly sprung. Light steering, clutch, shifter. Not as fun to drive as the Sportage, unfortunately. Great value but probably better suited for your aunt, with the automatic.

Next: Legacy manual. Nice. He had an 04 totalled a week or two ago, so this is a natural replacement. More substantial and upscale than his, and he liked the clutch and shifter. Back seat is huge now.

Next: Forester manual - NOPE! None in stock. Maybe next week. He really liked it otherwise.

Next: Escape manual - NOPE! Also none in stock. Apparently we did not get the memo - these exist only in catalogs.

So we drove a loaded up V6 model that stickered for a you-must-be-kidding $36 large. Not a hybrid, mind you. Design is very dated. It needs to be redesigned, and then that redesign needs to be redesigned. It's that old.

So Sportage and Legacy are on his short list. He's supposed to try to drive a manual Forester if one comes in tomorrow.

What other new cars come with:

* AWD
* manual trans
* moonroof

???

Very rare."
43,2011-02-21T01:21:27+00:00,fintail,"Airbag deployment? Wow...at least it was a low speed crash.

Yeah, moonroof manual cars have to be uncommon, and exponentially so with AWD."
44,2011-02-21T01:27:05+00:00,ateixeira,"No air bags, he sort of side-swiped us, going faster than us so pushing our bumper forward. We were going slow, there was a big pothole and we were turning left. Signal was on.

The guy was just an impatient nut."
45,2011-02-21T01:39:32+00:00,fintail,Did he have insurance? I heard some blurb on the radio today that 20% of drivers have no insurance. I can believe it.
46,2011-02-21T01:48:38+00:00,ateixeira,"Luckily, yes. Progressive.

He was VERY angry at first. Probably at himself.

We let him cool down. He rolled down his window and stuck out his insurance card and ID. It was very strange. I took cell phone photos of his license plate in case he took off. Also snapped photos of his license, insurance, and registration. Once he calmed down we politely asked if he would follow us to the dealership - 200 feet away!

Very strange experience.

I was happy to hand him off to the dealership manager and get the heck out of there. He got our names as witnesses.

We bailed. I wanted to test a Kizashi but felt guilty, so we just took off."
47,2011-02-21T01:57:51+00:00,fintail,"Probably had a recent accident.

I bet the salesman was having a great day...no sale, and ruined car."
48,2011-02-21T05:22:10+00:00,stickguy,"AWD, roof, manual. Let's see:

you already found the SX4. my wife's cousin has one. must be roomy, since he is about 6'2"", and pushing 270. at least. But, he loves it.

And I almost got a 2007 Legacy SE wagon a few years back, but that was an AT. Great car though.

what you missed?

- volvo V70 AWD (think it has to be a t5). Not sure which years also came in a manual, and probably rare as hens teeth. Good luck finding one, but at least it will almost certainly have a roof!

Audi A4 of course. again, good luck finding a stick if they were offered.

some variants of the tuscon might fit. A prior generation Rav4? Nissan Rouge?

Thinking hard here, but if the hard part is the roof, find something with AWD and a stick, and have the roof added (the other 2 items you are stuck with!)

Oh yeah, a CRV used to be available that way."
49,2011-02-21T14:07:37+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, we felt guilty about it, but we weren't at fault.

Here's the funny part - it was Fitzgerald Suzuki. Later that day we went to Fitzgerald's other dealrs, since we like the no-haggle policy. We saw a guy who works at the Suzuki dealer at the Dodge/Subaru store! LOL

He must've said to himself, ""oh no, not again""."
0,2011-02-21T14:12:49+00:00,ateixeira,"SX4 is roomy up front, sure, but the back seat is a little tight, and the cargo area with 4 seats in use fits maybe one large suitcase. He definitely needs more room since our parents/friends travel often, and he's the airport shuttle.

Bummer Subaru no longer sells a Legacy wagon in the USA. The Outback is tarted up and costs a bunch more than the Legacy, pushing it out of his price range.

He had a roommate with a Volvo that nearly bankrupted him, so no go no matter what, even if it was a free car.

I suggested Audi. Oddly the Audi guys told me the V8 was the most reliable engine, so we looked at used S4s. Problem is, 13mpg city on premium fuel. Lovely, lovely car, I've done a road trip in one, but doesn't really meet his FE wants.

Used RAV4 would be an option. Toyota dropped the manual for the current generation, though.

Rogue only comes in CVT, I believe.

Used CR-V, yeah, but I think he'd rather have something that is a current model, at least. Our other brother has a new CR-V and he wouldn't want to be upstaged."
1,2011-02-21T14:14:11+00:00,ateixeira,"Actually when I included trucks, a few more appeared - Wrangler, XTerra, and FJ all come in manuals. They're a bit expensive, though, so it would have to be used, and then the FE numbers were poor, as well. He drives TONS of miles. His 04 had 123k IIRC."
2,2011-02-21T20:28:49+00:00,fintail,Surprised you aren't blacklisted :shades:
3,2011-02-21T22:02:23+00:00,ateixeira,"Me too!

And what a coincidence that the guy works for the only dealer group in town that has a manual SX4 and a manual Legacy. We went to another Subaru dealer first!"
4,2011-02-21T22:08:28+00:00,fintail,"I don't know if they even sell manual non-Imprezas here...can't remember the last time I saw one.

Now it would have been funny if he had been test driving a Bentley or something :shades:"
5,2011-02-21T22:14:35+00:00,ateixeira,"I wonder if the guy still would have attempted the pass?

Maybe only to ask for Grey Poupon!"
6,2011-02-21T22:16:37+00:00,fintail,"If I get hit by someone at fault, I want it to be against something like that :shades:

The passer probably would have done the same thing, some people are hopeless."
7,2011-02-21T22:33:24+00:00,fushigi,I'd say an Evo as a manual and AWD are standard and a sunroof is available. But if the Outback is priced out of his range then the Evo would be as well. And on the inside it's not particularly spacious or luxurious.
8,2011-02-22T12:55:06+00:00,anythngbutgm,Impreza with the Premium pack or an outback Sport. :shades:
9,2011-02-22T16:04:58+00:00,ateixeira,"Yep, meets the criteria, though it would have to be used to fall in his price range.

He found the Kizashi a bit small, though, so I imagine he'd feel the same about the Lancer/EVO.

Ralliart model - does it come with a true manual? When I searched I only found dual-clutch ones.

Impreza also fits but again, he's sort of leaning toward something bigger now. He liked the Sportage, but the manual only comes in FWD. He'll drive a Forester this week if he can find a manual Premium model.

Manuals are rare, it's ridiculous! Demand is there, just no supply."
10,2011-02-24T16:58:55+00:00,ateixeira,"2 Mini Cooper Clubmans. Though I guess they're not exactly new any more, since the Countryman is out and I've seen one of those in the flesh.

New Benz C class with the 7 LEDs in the front. I'm not sure I like it when you can count the number of LED bulbs. They should be close together enough to avoid that.

Brand new Ford Explorer as well.

When I went to test drive the Escape with my brother, the dealer told me those are in short supply, and that most are pre-sold before they even arrive."
11,2011-02-24T19:01:36+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Leaf last night parked at a grocery store...I assume the same I have seen before, all have been blue."

Hybrid Lexus hybrid HSD hybrid HS250 hybrid hybrid.

14,2011-02-24T22:19:21+00:00,lemko,"Somebody did have an old-school Honda Insight out the other day. This little ""bullet car"" has a lot more character than the Prius clone that now passes for an Insight."
15,2011-02-24T22:25:17+00:00,fintail,"CR-Z tries to be both a super hybrid and a new era CRX. Good luck with that.

I see an old Insight now and then on my street too."
16,2011-02-25T13:14:13+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Seen a couple of Sonata Turbos, really sharp looking car. One of the sleekest in its class IMO.

Also while not new, it was quite hilarious I saw Government Motors symbol of ridiculous excess this morning, a Hummer H2 in the slow lane on the highway doing about 10 mph under the speed limit... Hypermiling?"
17,2011-02-25T13:26:44+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Spotted a couple of those new Explorers. Word is they are sold before they even hit the dealer lots...

19,2011-02-25T15:07:38+00:00,lemko,"Heck, KIA would've even be here if S.Korea's govt. didn't foist it onto Hyundai."
20,2011-02-25T15:13:38+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Actually no...

2 things:

First, Kia was created under a partnership with Ford, Nissan, I think maybe Mazda? and 2 or 3 other companies which I don't recall at the moment. It has been operating since the 80's/early 90's and was even behind the original Ford Festiva and/or Fiesta subcompacts.

Second, Hyundai does not own Kia, this is merely a rumor. Actually up until recently, I believe Kia was a separate entity that was on it's own or had very little influence from Hyundai motor.

At the moment, I believe Hyundai has 30 or so % interest in them. True, they do share a lot of commonality but they are not ""owned"" by Hyundai per se.

I may be wrong in all this, so I apologize in advance. My Hyundai knowledge is kinda limited..."
21,2011-02-25T15:18:43+00:00,ateixeira,"I dunno, while Hyundai/Kia have thrived, Daewoo (now GM-DAT) and Daihatsu have done miserably.

Hyundai's doing something right..."
22,2011-02-25T15:23:59+00:00,fintail,"Maybe the best cronyism? It's not exactly a business culture free from ethical issues. HyunKia has a virtual monopoly of the market at home. It's received plenty of pampering from the homeland.

Daihatsu is Japanese with large scale Toyota influence, I'm pretty sure."
23,2011-02-25T15:26:02+00:00,lemko,Daihutsu's not Korean. It's Japanese and under the umbrella of Toyota. I do remember the short-lived Charade and Rocky in the early 1990s. Does Ssangyong still exist? Does Samsung still make cars?
24,2011-02-25T15:27:00+00:00,fintail,"Looks like some kind of help was needed once...it's all OK though, so long as it's not my money"
25,2011-02-25T16:19:53+00:00,ateixeira,"Sorry, I meant Ssangyong, and yes they're still around. They sell cars in Brazil, at least.

They have a ""ute"" they sell there, a car-based pickup a-la-Subaru Baja. Funky looking thing."
26,2011-02-27T02:16:35+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Chrysler 200 today, on the lot. A world nicer than what it replaces, but you don't have to squint hard to see where it comes from."
27,2011-02-27T15:58:04+00:00,ateixeira,"For me it only went half way.

Chrysler has hit some home runs lately, but the 200 is a bunt.

Funny thing is they had to use it in the Eminem ads because it's one of the few new cars they actually build in Michigan."
28,2011-02-27T16:17:18+00:00,fintail,"I look at the Sebring as so offensive, anything has to be light years ahead. Re-introducing the 2001 model would have been a leap forward."
29,2011-02-27T16:24:38+00:00,ateixeira,"But the 200 is a face-lifted Sebring. I bet the doors are interchangeable.

I think the Fusion and Malibu became competitive years ago, 200 still isn't."
30,2011-02-27T16:30:15+00:00,fintail,"They made do with what they could. A facelift from that awkward hoary thing is a relief. I am shocked when I see Sebrings that aren't rentals.

Chrysler isn't really competitive in most passenger car segments right now anyway."
31,2011-02-28T19:46:59+00:00,ateixeira,"Agreed.

Maybe Fiat can help them."
32,2011-02-28T20:55:03+00:00,andys120,"Maybe Fiat can help them.

Maybe they can but when I see Chrysler 200s being rebadged as Lancias, that's not a good sign.

They should offer a Fiat Diesel in the Jeep Wrangler."

My brother briefly considered a Wrangler and then saw the deal-killer (to him) gas mileage."

36,2011-03-01T01:22:46+00:00,fintail,And everywhere else also gets the much nicer looking Touring...BMW knows what some want...some with more money than sense.
37,2011-03-01T06:42:37+00:00,fintail,Spotted what I am pretty sure was a Lexus CT at the dealer this evening. Weird kind of ugly light/bright green.
38,2011-03-01T15:06:24+00:00,anythngbutgm,Fuel pumps have been a big problem for those as well as the smaller Terrains and Equinoxes...
39,2011-03-01T17:01:24+00:00,ateixeira,I saw a Panamera's rear view and I feel about the same way you do.
40,2011-03-01T17:02:01+00:00,ateixeira,"Baby diarrhea metallic green?

They probably want colors that remind you it's a hybrid."
41,2011-03-01T18:21:20+00:00,fintail,"It was kind of a bright yellow green, or at least it looked that way from a distance. That color will be a tough sell, I don't know if the tapwater bland average Lexus buyer would be into that.

On the new car front, saw a new Elantra this morning, couldn't tell if it was fleet or not"
42,2011-03-01T19:20:01+00:00,ateixeira,"I had to look...yuck.

Daybreak Yellow Mica. Definitely out of character for a normally conservative brand.

It's not quite baby diarrhea green, though. More Mountain Dew-ish."
43,2011-03-01T20:21:19+00:00,fintail,"That would be it.

47,2011-03-02T18:38:19+00:00,ateixeira,"I know what we can call that color:

Mountain Dew-Doo.

Saw a Sonata with temp tags today. Of course nowadays I see about 874 per day so only the temp tags tell me it's actually brand new."
48,2011-03-02T18:57:20+00:00,fintail,"I might actually stop and look at the CT at my local dealer when I am by there again on a free day. Newest thing L has had in some time.

I see many new style Sonata too, although I'd say at least 1 in 4 or 5 is a rental."
49,2011-03-02T19:00:24+00:00,ateixeira,"If gas stays at $4 the CT will do fine.

It gas goes back to the old ""free"" levels then it won't.

It could make the HS redundant. In fact the HS had its worst month ever probably because Lexus customers know the CT is coming and may have post-poned their purchase."
0,2011-03-02T19:01:58+00:00,fintail,"It will make the HS redundant. CT offers virtually everything the HS does at a lower price, and isn't as boring looking."
1,2011-03-02T19:16:57+00:00,ateixeira,"Much better mileage, too. Remember, the CT gets the Prius' drivetrain, while the HS gets the Camry Hybrid's.

A) had actually advertised the damn thing
had one on the lots to show off
C) offered it with a manual tranny like the more popular sedan
D) gave it a Lexus-like interior instead of the cold, industrial one it ended up with.

I loved the idea of the Sportcross, it was points B and C that kept me from ever buying one. :sick:

I guess even closer than a Venza is a Camry wagon, the Crosstour is the (NA) Accord wagon. We get the Euro Accord wagon, finally, in kind of a dumbed down form as the new Acura Sportwagon - haven't seen one here yet but I saw several Euro Accord wagons in Germany."
25,2011-03-04T21:07:06+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw the Crosstour but test drove an Odyssey. The former doesn't fit my needs or appeal to me, minus the AWD availability.

I've driven the Subie."

This continues to make me question the wholesale switch to turbos we seem to be experiencing. They test well on the EPA cycle, but real-world experience seems to be much worse, at the expense (literally) of highly-stressed engines. CR has the 335i as 'much worse than average' for repairs, while the 328i is 'better than average', I think. Not a good sign."
29,2011-03-07T15:11:49+00:00,andys120,The poor showings oof the 335i and the 135i on the FOR charts seems to have more to do with the high-pressure fuel pumps (HPFP) than the turbos or the engines themselves.
30,2011-03-07T15:26:57+00:00,ateixeira,"True, but why aren't the N/A engines affected? Don't they also use DI? Maybe fewer PSI in their HPFPs?

I saw a Juke this weekend - still haven't gotten used to them.

A small turbo like that will work hard all the time. Especially if they get the young buyer they market towards."
31,2011-03-08T17:36:13+00:00,andys120,My understanding is that the normally aspirated Bimmers don't run such high pressure in their pumps.

The Koreans were big with Budget there from what I can see, while local Budget has a Nissan majority.

15,2011-03-16T00:27:35+00:00,andys120,I've been wondering where they are too. I see Lacrosses all the time; maybe the Regal is just too small for Buick types.

$1000 dealer incentives on top of $500 cash back or 0% financing.

Consumers waited for the deals, and now they're here.

I did the math and that means invoice prices start in the $23k range. That's cheap!"

20,2011-03-17T19:11:49+00:00,fezo,"This is what happens when I see brown and Buick in the same sentence.

A buddy of mine, back in his starving college student days had this old brown 64 Buick he referred to as the brown bomber. It was everything you;d expect in what was no doubt a $150 car. No knock on it. It had its day and that was well before he bought it.

My favorite of its many quirks was that the plain old analog clock in it only ran when the ignition was on. Of course this meant it was useless but it was certainly entertaining."
21,2011-03-17T20:05:11+00:00,andys120,"I think the Regal is selling poorly because it's priced only a few hundred cheaper than the equivalent Lacrosse and doesn't get any better mileage than a 4 cylinder LC.

I really don't know who the Regal is aimed at. The baby-boomers who might prefer the Regal's European provenance would probably prefer more exciting styling and six cylinder power. They might also prefer a model name that didn't remind them of their father's Buick.

The Old Timers are going to gravitate to the bigger Buicks especially for virtually the same money."

Sales are up but the incentives had a lot to do with it.

I think it tries to compete with the Acura TSX, but may end up being more of a Suzuki Kizashi alternative."

She's been with foreign brands since 1993 but if the Verano meets her list, it could very well displace the new Elantra from our garage. I prefer the Elantra but since it'll be her car & she's paying for it, her choice for what she wants. Can always get the Elantra when I replace my '06 Civic in 2014 or '15.

It could be the next Cimarron, or...

Since Buick is getting unique powertrains, and they're powering a much lighter car, it could turn out to be a performance bargain.

Execution will be crucial."
28,2011-03-18T18:24:12+00:00,lemko,The platform the Veranno is based upon is a quantum leap over the cruddy Cavalier upon which the Cimmaron was based. Cruddy foundation = cruddy house.

Would like it in a slushbox but they don't seem to offer it that way. Nissan interiors have definitely improved a bit in my opinion & my kid loves her Versa tremendously. I've been driving it once a week with her for about 120 miles and once the CVT gets going, it moves very nicely. Once I put the cruise on, I'm a happy guy. And lastly, the brakes stop the car in a controlled, linear way which I appreciate, as some of the drivers here in South Florida drive stupidly...feel I have good control with this car!

2011 BMW 535i

A neighbor from a block over just bought it and was showing it off as he knows I'm something of an auto enthusiast. His old ride was a Ford Windstar minivan. Must be livin' large nowadays!"
38,2011-03-21T14:33:55+00:00,ateixeira,"A lot of critics are saying it went a bit soft. Funny factoid - the Hyundai Genesis had a quicker speed in Consumer Reports' slalom maneuver thingy. Is that officially embarassing?

I found the 535i a bit laggy, it's not quick until the turbo spools. Didn't get to go fast enough to test the suspension, but it sure was comfortable.

The V8 was a lot better.

BMW's Nav screen is HUGE but M-B's is easier to read for some reason."

Lexus LS also had the worst accident avoidance figures according to the same source.

If only we'd get a 535d. The F11 I rented had wonderful seats, and the nav is indeed excellent, especially for a German."
41,2011-03-21T18:08:15+00:00,ateixeira,"Not sure but CR tends to buy volume models.

The Genesis R-spec is not even out yet, nor is the M5.

Is BMW reserving the ""sporty"" for the M only, though? That would be a mistake IMHO."
42,2011-03-21T18:14:22+00:00,fintail,"Well, let's say they compared a base 528i (sans sport and premium) to a Genesis 4.6 - and I could see CR doing this just to get attention. Who knows what would happen.

I don't know if a BMW that lacks sport package is really any sportier than its competition. German cars are all about options."
43,2011-03-21T18:30:25+00:00,ateixeira,That's true - you have to option them up appropriately. Unfortunately those packages are spendy.
44,2011-03-21T18:53:05+00:00,fintail,That's why the Germans are so profitable - the margins on option packages have to be gigantic. You can base a 5er or E in the upper 40s and load it up to over 70K without a lot of trouble - and that's not counting tuned versions.

23,2011-03-25T00:42:41+00:00,iwant12,"Saw a new Durango, in white, coming home this afternoon. I have to say that I liked it! Much smoother looking than the last model. And it had dual exhausts! Have you noticed Dodge isn't putting the Hemi badges on the new Durango nor the Grand Cherokee? Mind games . . . ? Perception?"
24,2011-03-25T13:24:42+00:00,ateixeira,"Hemi became a bad word when gas hit $4 a gallon.

In fact, I think it hurt Dodge that they put so much of their marketing effort behind the Hemi engine. Gas went up, sales tanked. And they had no Plan B.

Now they market Ram instead, in fact they branded all trucks Ram, even the Grand Caravan work vans.

PS I like the Durango a lot better, too, but that NAV screen is too small this day and age"

Saw one out in the wild and it looks so, so much better. Not pretty, but it's no longer got that giant chrome pimple on its nose."
27,2011-03-25T14:39:10+00:00,fintail,"I see those all the time around here now, usually at Whole Foods etc parking lots. Competition for the RX I guess.

I saw an odd beaky TL yesterday - someone had painted or taped over the chrome, trying to hide the design."
28,2011-03-25T14:47:07+00:00,ateixeira,I think the fact that there are many aftermarket grilles for sale tells you what many think of the beak.

Would eventually like a small car with better seating for my spinal issues which I can just slide over into...just like my girl's Versa! But with more goodies to play with. My next ride will be my last one & I do want it to be ""FUN"" with some upscale stuff included...have always let $ and mileage be the parameters in choosing but this last time I'm doing it just ""for me & me only""! It'll be ""dad's toy"" to live out his last years in. Won't be lookin' till at least an 2015 model though as I just hit 31k in the Civic & with my new driving style, doubt I'll even have 45k by then!

Q5. See those all the time now.

New Honda Oddity.

Juke.

New E-class.

By far the best looking of that bunch is the Q5."

I've seen 3 Volts on the road now, a few Jukes and Odys.

41,2011-04-01T01:27:50+00:00,fintail,"Oh yeah, I've seen 2 of those as well.

Blends into traffic more than a Volt, to me."

43,2011-04-04T13:39:42+00:00,lemko,...new silver Lincoln MKz at work. Somebody must've bought it this weekend as it still has the window stickers and dealer's/manufacturer's crayon marks on the glass.
44,2011-04-05T01:07:24+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a new BMW X3 parked in the GW University campus area.

Not as elegant as the Q5.

Also spotted a Chevy Cruze."
45,2011-04-05T02:18:34+00:00,texases,"Finally starting to see Q5 around here, I agree, better look than the new X3. What has surprised me is the large number of Tiguans I'm seeing. I like the Q5 quite a bit more.

And the odd sighting: 2 smarts, identical color (red/black) within a block of each other. Maybe some company cars? But no adverts on the sides..."
46,2011-04-05T16:48:18+00:00,ateixeira,"Funny thing is VW folks insist they are not related. The Tig is a Golf clone while the Q5 is supposedly A4 based.

They're so similarly sized it's hard to tell."

Q3
Tiguan

Touareg
Q7"

Meanwhile i saw some guy driving a third generation Accord. He may have had as much open exposure through the rust as the guy in the Camaro had with topless deal."

Not two...

But THREE new BMW 5 series this morning, one with temp tags and all.

Sure looks better than the outgoing Dame Edna ones."

It could be practical, too."

I will admit that the Cube has grown on me and now i rather like it but I'm the only one in the family that feels that way."
8,2011-04-07T17:30:11+00:00,lemko,Saw a brown Kia Borrego EX in front of me on my way back from lunch today. I never heard of this model.
9,2011-04-07T17:41:23+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, they missed the SUV boat. An old school truck just as car-like rides became popular."
10,2011-04-07T19:24:15+00:00,ateixeira,"5er sedan in the AM. VOB tags so either a loaner car or was just sold.

E coupe on I Street caught my eye, until I saw the red Ducati 749 parked next to it.

I'll take the Italian one. :shades:"

Suzuki Burgman 400:

http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/245/794/Motorcycle-Article/2007-Suzuki-Burgman-400- -First-Ride.aspx

Reminds me of the Honda Helix. Very substantial looking, 14"" rims apparently. That's bigger than the wheels on my old Chevy Sprint."
12,2011-04-07T19:30:07+00:00,fintail,"I saw a Piaggio MP3 the other day.

Still haven't seen a S1000RR on the street, I think I like those."
13,2011-04-07T19:34:47+00:00,andys120,"I just happened to see a couple of early 90s sports cars in very nice shape.

Firs I saw a ca. 1990 Nissan 300ZX, in that pale yellow that shouldn't work on a sports car but does on that one, looked in like new shape.

Then I spotted a Mitsu 3000GT in white (not a flattering color for it) in pretty good cond but not as nice as the Nissan."
14,2011-04-07T19:41:58+00:00,ateixeira,"First I've seen on the streets, and the funny thing is it had Florida plates here in the nation's capital! Go figure.

It was a nice gunmetal gray-ish color."

http://www.autoblog.com/2011/04/07/videos-mercedes-benz-concept-a-class-shows-of- f-its-finer-points/

Neat concept. So much nicer than the C-coupe ever was. I like the glass roof and the inverted mesh inserts for the grille. Hopefully some of those make production.

The creases on the side remind me of some BMWs and even the outgoing Impreza, with the concave surfaces.

Any why not dock a tablet like that?"
16,2011-04-07T20:00:26+00:00,fintail,Been waiting for a universal navi etc dock to appear in cars. Maybe that'll be it.
17,2011-04-07T20:11:47+00:00,ateixeira,"Auto makers might resist because portable tablets could potentially kill a MAJOR profit center for them - tech packages.

Why pay $2200 for a lame DVD-based (not even BluRay) Rear Entertainment System with a tiny 7-8"" screen when you can buy *FOUR* iPads for less?

Give an iPad to each family member."
18,2011-04-07T20:13:41+00:00,fintail,Maybe make up for it with volume? Charge just a few hundred for a dock and sell 10x as many of them.
19,2011-04-07T20:30:33+00:00,ateixeira,"Make the dock standard, maybe? Though good luck getting the industry to standardize on size. There's already a new iPad."
20,2011-04-07T21:16:50+00:00,fintail,"No standard dock, money has to be made somehow. The industry should have standard size or part of some kind though, so units can be used in multiple locations."

I used to have a Yamaha Majesty 400, which is the same thing. Cruised at 75mph with little trouble, and had 60 liters of storage under the seat. But, those little wheels and plastic bodywork made crosswinds major events at freeway speed. I'm on a motorcycle now.

If you want a really substantial scooter, check out the Burgman 650 and the Honda Silver Wing. The big Burger has even bigger wheels."
22,2011-04-07T23:49:41+00:00,stickguy,"Volvo is coming out with something like this. It is a pivoting dock built into the driver's A pillar, designed to hold a Garmin. It has built in power plug/jack/connector of some kind, so no need for wires. And, it still pops out to take with you. So most of the advantages of built in, but still portable. Not having to deal with the wires and suction cup sounds nice.

one neat feature of the unit (not sure if they all do this) is a ""where's my car"" feature. It remembers where you popped it out, and can guide you back to your car."
23,2011-04-07T23:50:59+00:00,stever,My Garmin has that but you have to go into the menu to set it when you leave the car. It was spot on the one time I used it in pedestrian mode in a busy tourist town.

27,2011-04-08T16:39:25+00:00,ateixeira,"Thinking about it some more, the manufacturers could make money selling docking interfaces for various devices. Edit: stickguy says Volvo is doing something like this.

Why not? They sell pig tail cable adaptors now.

28,2011-04-08T21:47:38+00:00,fintail,"yeah, those ipod kids can be many hundreds of dollars. It's just a matter of time before similar exists for navi. Still a lot cheaper than a fully integrated unit.

I would not be surprised if 20% of the cars Mitsubishi now sells are in Puerto Rico, given how few they sell in the continental USA.

We rented a Lancer for a day trip, from San Juan, along the coast eastward, then down to Fajardo. Not bad but not as scenic as I'd hoped.

Car was OK, nothing special. CVT took getting used to, it lags at first, then revs up high and sits there, motorboating at high rpm. Steering was both artificial and heavy, as if they were trying to make it bad. Lots of tire noise. Bare bones model had lots of cheap plastics, but the seats were comfy and it cost next to nothing ($30 for the day with tax included).

Got 25.4 mpg, not bad but I expected better.

18,2011-05-02T16:25:24+00:00,qbrozen,"I've seen 2 of the new Lexus Sportcross .... uhhh... I mean... whatever its called now. Pretty good looking car in person, actually. Too bad they made it so slow."
19,2011-05-02T16:26:35+00:00,ateixeira,"CT200h?

The commercial for it is neat, my son likes the beat of the music."
20,2011-05-02T16:28:21+00:00,qbrozen,"ummm... well, yes. With a completely uninteresting and anonymous name like that, I had to look it up to confirm."
21,2011-05-02T16:31:48+00:00,ateixeira,"Are they slow?

I thought they were tuned for more get-up-and-go vs. the Prius powertrain they're based on.

Then again it's the same basic powertrain carrying 400 lbs extra soft-touch materials. (not really, it's a different platform actually)"
22,2011-05-02T16:59:40+00:00,qbrozen,"exactly. Same powertrain, more weight. Edmunds says its .3 secs slower to 60 than a Prius."
23,2011-05-02T17:18:55+00:00,ateixeira,"10.3 seconds isn't quick, for sure, especially nowadays, but anyone who calls that slow ought to take a spin in a Smart ForTwo or my old 1986 Chevy Sprint.

0-60?

Yes. Eventually.

*If* you're going down a hill.

Hybrids don't feel slow at all because the electric engine hits peak torque at zero rpm, so they actually step off nicely.

I think it has more to do with how they're driven..."
24,2011-05-02T17:35:05+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I've seen a couple of the new CT's as well. Looks decent in person, if it had AWD, I would consider it."

But are you considering either of those cars right now? Sure, we've all had slower cars. Its a new day, though. No need to suffer anymore."
26,2011-05-02T18:37:26+00:00,andys120,New Camaros are selling quite nicely in New Hamster. Two days running I've seen two different ones in a high-viz neon metallic green.
27,2011-05-02T19:31:28+00:00,ateixeira,"Well, the Smart is an alternative ""city car"", if you will.

Odds are many buyers are moving up from a Prius, so it will seem normal to them.

I drive a minivan that's probably quicker than most muscle cars were back in the day, so I'm not suffering at all. :shades:"
28,2011-05-02T20:46:06+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw an SLS parked on the street here in DC, near Farragut North.

Oddly enough, then I saw a Ferrari F360 Modena, pulling out and driving past it.

Not a very common sight, much less back-to-back!"
29,2011-05-02T22:27:30+00:00,tifighter,"Brand new Leaf drove past me Saturday. Yep, it makes an odd sound."
30,2011-05-03T13:48:43+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a new E550 convertible, nice.

Then a 5 series sedan, also nice.

Then a 550 GT, yuck. You just can't love the swollen bulge look (also the X6, ZDX, Panamera).

White Elantra with temp tags, nice.

3/4 ain't bad. :shades:"
31,2011-05-03T17:30:18+00:00,fintail,"I have to wonder about what makes one buy a GT.

Saw one of those weird new Nissan vans parked at the dealer.

Oh yeah, Sunday I saw a facelift (LEDs) GL pulling a utility trailer. Rare sight, a working posh poser SUV."

38,2011-05-09T16:46:09+00:00,ateixeira,"Let me try to remember them all, hmmm...

Fiat 500 - a dealer had half a dozen of them displayed at the Kentlands Parade on Saturday.

Also saw an Orange Camaro convertible. First Camaro I could see out of.

And my first in-person Chrysler 200 convertible. Is it me or has the back seat shrunk? I remember Sebrings having roomy back seats in the past."
39,2011-05-09T16:47:20+00:00,ateixeira,"I think that's what they are called, the new minivan thing.

I did a double-take and wondered if it had diplomatic tags, but couldn't tell. Are they for sale already?

This and the Mazda5 are the only true MINIvans left, since the Kia Rondo was dropped."
40,2011-05-09T16:50:26+00:00,lemko,"Speaking of the Mazda 5, I saw a dark blue one on my way home from the store yesterday."
41,2011-05-09T16:52:21+00:00,ateixeira,"Funny that they launch it with the old styling lines down the sides just as they come out with concepts showing they will change styling direction.

I liked the outgoing one more. Plus the USA never got power sliding doors or AWD, like the JDM models get.

Mazda doesn't put much effort behind it here."
42,2011-05-09T16:52:23+00:00,stickguy,"I thought they weren't coming out until the fall? I am very interested in this, since it could be a perfect fit. Especially if they surprise me and bring it over with a 6 speed stick.

the new 2.0l engine (NA) and the stick should be a nice combo of excellent FE and plenty of scoot."
43,2011-05-09T16:56:44+00:00,ateixeira,"It may have been a diplomat's gray market import. Unfortunately I looked for tags but it was moving in the other direction.

I'll have to drag it out of the recycling.. dang it!"

His reviews are sort of soft, he likes most everything he drives."
47,2011-05-13T11:18:49+00:00,andys120,"I saw a new '012 Ford Focus on the highway, a black five-door. Not a bad looking car, it reminded me a little of a Citroen C4."
48,2011-05-13T12:19:39+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Not that anyone would notice but I had no idea there was a refreshed Corolla out there. Seeing a bunch of them lately. And from a distance they look a bit more upscale than before but again, it's a Corolla so I'm not sure anyone would really care, lol"

Local Saab dealer has a host of the new cars on his forecourt...must be a brutally tough sell. Orphan baggage already, endlessly different, not cheap."
3,2011-05-16T00:04:24+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw one of those new Corollas the other day, also.

It got the bulging lights that's common on Toyota's now (also on Camry, Sienna, 4Runner)."
4,2011-05-16T00:05:28+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw my first, and then my 2nd, a couple of days apart. First a white one near Williamsburg, VA. Then a red one in the MD 'burbs.

Definitely looks better in person."
5,2011-05-16T17:33:55+00:00,fintail,"I've noticed the bulging lights too. Seems like it would expose the lenses to more wear and greater risk of damage. Another wonderful Asian brand styling theme...

I've seen several new Focus on the road in the past couple days."
6,2011-05-16T18:42:53+00:00,ateixeira,There are advantages - I'm sure the turn signal indicators are visible from greater angles.
7,2011-05-16T18:52:27+00:00,fintail,"Funny that not everyone would be on the bandwagon then. It's being different for the sake of being different, IMO"
8,2011-05-16T18:54:54+00:00,ateixeira,"I guess the alternative are the side marker lamps common on European cars, but they you have to add a whole extra light and cut an extra hole in the sheetmetal.

You've gotta admit - Toyota's solution is more elegant."
9,2011-05-16T18:56:15+00:00,texases,"Naw, the protruding thing is strictly a styling gimmick. No need to stick out like that, looks odd to me."
10,2011-05-16T19:06:43+00:00,fintail,"Bulging light assemblies from a company that led the way for huge hilariously stretched out light assemblies? I am not seeing the elegance, nor anything about better visibility - this isn't the response to a mandate like side marker lights, just a new styling trend of questionable at best aesthetics.. It's the product a designer with his own sense of taste and a suit who agrees."
11,2011-05-16T19:09:40+00:00,texases,"Yep, my '96 ES met all the regs, not a bulge in sight (note, not mine, I'm not a 'leopard skin' kinda guy :P ):"
12,2011-05-16T19:13:04+00:00,ateixeira,"Others put them on the front fender, or the side mirrors nowadays."
13,2011-05-16T20:49:31+00:00,stickguy,"saw one of them recently too. Did not recognize until i saw the badge.

This is just a styling refresh, right? Seems like Toyota is doing a Bettle like model cycle on this one! Man is it outdated.

Or did they really release a new model, and just no one noticed?"
14,2011-05-16T22:07:43+00:00,stever,"New categories - ""we have 12 mostly new categories like Most Wanted Car We Can't Have, Most Wanted Exotic, Most Wanted Cheap Car, Most Wanted Fuel Sipper, Most Wanted Hatchback, Most Wanted Hot Rod Divisionthings you actually care about.""

15,2011-05-17T16:35:04+00:00,ateixeira,"It's just a mid cycle refresh.

Actually, I saw another one today, and then the look that it replaced. I think the update looks a little better. Both set of lights bulge out, but the new one has more shape to it."
16,2011-05-17T18:16:12+00:00,qbrozen,But I really don't think I've ever seen one of these in person until today... a Jag X-type wagon. Took me a minute to figure it out since I completely forgot they even made one.
17,2011-05-17T18:18:25+00:00,ateixeira,"Should have come as a Mondeo wagon.

Having Jaguar slotted above Ford really hurt Ford products. It limited what they could be. It was also a reason to withhold the best Ford products from Europe.

Good riddance."
18,2011-05-18T21:02:42+00:00,lemmer,"I don't know if it was the same one, but I've seen an X wagon multiple times around here lately."

I don't think I've seen as many rentals cars in my life as you have the past week or so."
21,2011-05-19T14:51:12+00:00,fintail,"There is an endless list of large corporations with headquarters or major operations within a few miles of where I live. It is a rental car mecca indeed. With a little observation (lack of license plate frame, recently issued plates, barcode) I can keep up with the fleets anyway, interesting car spotting."
22,2011-05-22T01:49:16+00:00,fintail,"I've seen 2 new Optimas in the past day, and the biggest shock of all - both private vehicles, not rentals, unlike every second or third Sonata I see."

24,2011-05-22T21:51:44+00:00,andys120,"I've been seeing a few 2012 Ford Foci, all of them five door hatches. It's nice to see that imminently practical bodystyle catch on in the US.

I also got a quick glance at a new Fiat 500 on the NYS Thruway near Kingston. It looked just like the Cabrio tested by Inside Line >



I wonder if it was the same car."
25,2011-05-23T18:28:54+00:00,ateixeira,"Love it...wonder if it's really as fun as it looks.

I like the slide-back top, takes up no space. Of course it does block the rear view...can't have it all."
26,2011-05-23T20:40:25+00:00,fushigi,"I don't think they're for sale yet in Illinois so this blue Leaf had apparently fallen far from the tree.

The Leaf wasn't plugged in, but the owner was refueling (I saw it in a Burger King parking lot)."

28,2011-05-26T18:57:49+00:00,stickguy,"got 2 of the Honda products serviced yesterday, so since I was there I sat in a new Civic.

Blah.

pretty much had to see them side by side to even notice it was different. Interior very similar too, but the seats seemed to be slightly more comfortable (still not good, just better).

Overall, seemed like much more of a MMC than a new model.

And IMO will only appeal to the people that liked the current car and want more of the same. if you didn't like the outgoing model, you ain't gonna like this one!"
29,2011-05-26T19:03:49+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Overall, seemed like much more of a MMC than a new model.

I believe that is all that it is. A full model change won't happen till the next round.

I am anxious to drive the K24 in the new Si. I've driven multiple TSX's with it and it's damn near perfect if you are like me and enjoy working to get the most power. The 34lb/ft increase in torque should be a welcomed improvement. :shades:"
30,2011-05-26T19:04:54+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw a new sedan pulling out of Westfield Shoppingtown Montgomery yesterday.

The only notable difference is the tail lights, and oddly enough they remind me of the Neon."

I probably see a dozen or so Q5s per day."

33,2011-05-26T19:52:40+00:00,kyfdx,"My local BMW dealer, which is pretty large.... has a grand total of two (2) X3s on the lot...

The prior proliferation was due to killer lease deals, which have yet to appear on the new ones... I wouldn't look for too many more sightings...

I love the Q5... leases out higher than the X3, though.... too rich for us."
34,2011-05-27T00:33:12+00:00,ateixeira,"I like the Q5 but they seem so small. I'd just get a 5 door GTI instead, probably at half the cost.

No AWD on the GTI, though. Wait for the R."

I've been shopping heavily, as she only has 5 months to go.... lol..."
37,2011-05-27T14:11:26+00:00,ateixeira,"She is hooked on the seating position, visibility and bad weather traction

Same with my wife. Substitute ""X3"" with ""Forester"". She had a wagon before, but no way she's going back.

Add easy ingress/egress to that list."

But not very BMW-like..."
40,2011-05-27T14:31:25+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, but not intended to be...the WRX wagon (more of a hatch lately) fills that niche."
41,2011-05-27T15:28:42+00:00,anythngbutgm,"In this segment, I am a big fan of the XC60 and Infiniti EX35. The latter for me, because I don't have kids and it drives like a G coupe (goes like stink). But the airy cabin and giant moonroof on the XC would seal the deal if it were my wife"
42,2011-05-27T16:24:22+00:00,stickguy,"great, you can do the research for me. whenever we finally are able to get out of th eminivan ($ issue now, not space needs really!) my wife wants some kind of cross over.

I also relaly like the XC60 (as did the wife), and the X3 is really nice. One decision will end up being exactly how small to go. Might need to stay with something about the size of the Highlander, though most of them weigh as much as the van. if not more.

The Hyundai santa fe is also a very nice (and well priced) option."
43,2011-05-27T16:38:39+00:00,kyfdx,"The EX35 would be a great choice for her.... and, they sometimes have giveaway lease deals, because it hasn't been very popular.. But, the first three times I pointed it out, she said, ""That's not an SUV, it's a wagon.""

I guess it just doesn't have the look for her... Of course, we all know that wagons are the coolest..... but, she ain't buyin it...

Now that she works from home, and her mileage has dropped from 16K/yr to about 10K/year, we may look closer into buying new or CPO... I like the XC60, and it comes with 5yr/60K warranty and maintenance.... , which we've grown to love with BMWs...

We'll see how it goes.."
44,2011-05-27T16:40:15+00:00,stickguy,"the EX isn't a wagon. It is a hatch. and way, way too small in the cargo area (distinct lack of U) to be considered for our family car."
45,2011-05-27T16:42:22+00:00,kyfdx,"Only child leaves for college in 2012... plus, he already has his own car...

The EX35 would be big enough for us... Yeah, it's not going to fit the 52"" LCD (still in the box) from Best Buy, like the X3... but, it will haul our little bit of crap..."
46,2011-05-27T17:35:15+00:00,ateixeira,"I find the EX to be tiny, but I have kids and drive a minivan now.

Still, we think our Foresters is borderline, just barely big enough. We wouldn't go any smaller.

I like the XC60. My favorite in its class as far as styling goes.

Anyone considering a Santa Fe should also look at the Kia Sorento, which is a clone but is a fresher design. It's bigger than any of the above, though."

Ford Explorer, then another. They're not uncommon now.

Toyota Highlander, the refreshed one.

M-B E350 4Matic wagon.

Elantras left and right. I see a couple of day now.

Drif-tastic Lexus GX at the beach.

This morning on the way in, saw a 550i sedan, then a new X3."

2,2011-06-02T16:39:03+00:00,ateixeira,"Just looked and Kia has a $1500 incentive on the 2011 Optima...there are bargains to be had.

No rebate on the Sonata. Makes the Kia the obvious choice between the two, IMHO.

Chevy is giving away left over Malibus, though, so expect to see a bunch of temp tags on the outgoing Malibu until the new one arrives.

From afar I though it was an Elise ... but got closer and voila, Tesla roadster. Eerily silent while not moving in bumper-to-bumper DC traffic.

Also saw a new 5 door Focus, BMW X3, and E350 convertible."
4,2011-06-02T18:39:29+00:00,iwant12,Friend at work just picked up a new Avalon. Like the new tail lights. Also saw a new Jeep Grand Cherokee in my own garage at home! Me likey likey!!!

If so, congrats..."
6,2011-06-02T20:06:38+00:00,fintail,"Funny, as IMHO the Optima is far better looking than the Sonata. The most appealing Korean mainstream sedan ever, in my eyes.

End of a model run always has a fire sale, good time to buy if you want value."
7,2011-06-02T20:15:47+00:00,ateixeira,"Should have all the kinks worked out, too.

Heck, at $4000 less than competitors almost any model would be a compelling buy. I think all entries in that class are fairly similar anyway, besides an mpg here and a horse there.

Or just get a model with $4000 worth of extra content. People may not mind having the older model if you're also getting heated leather seats, a moonroof, and Navi for the same price as a competitor without any of those."
8,2011-06-02T21:07:04+00:00,fintail,"Sadly for the Malibu and GM profit margins, IIRC the center stack in the Malibu isn't right for nav - not even an option. The car itself seems kind of narrower than a Camcord, while the Impala is more bloated and dull...hard to compete with the leaders when you don't go head to head. But an end of the run Malibu could be a very good deal for the content."

14,2011-06-03T15:10:27+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw one at a parade in the Kentlands (MD) the other day.

i drove the bimmer mon-wed this week. Then back to the GTI yesterday. I found that tougher at first only because of the clutch/tranny. The GTI is SO MUCH easier to shift ... but it also needs to be wound up a bit more, so I bogged down quite a few times in the morning."

I got to drive the Cayman R, Spyder, Panamera, and a few 911 variants (no, not the GT2 ... GTS was as good as it got... although that's still pretty damned good).

Here are the pics."

26,2011-06-13T19:03:45+00:00,qbrozen,"Well, I didn't get to drive them as much or as hard as the literature had me believe, but we had fun nonetheless.

911 GTS is silly fast. Just pushes you back in your seat. Courses were wet, so that slowed us down a little, but they still had a great amount of grip, so it wasn't tame speeds by any measure. The three 911 variants I drove (4, 4S, and GTS) were on the long course, which was done while in a train of 4 cars led by an instructor car. We were only as fast as our slowest driver, which, unfortunately, made us quite a bit slower than we could have gone. In any case, my friend and I pushed it where we could through corners and short burst of acceleration. All cars were very nice, of course.

I had much more fun on the short course where I got to drive 2 Cayman Rs, a Boxster Syder, and a Boxster S (pic shows 2 Syders and 1 Cayman, but that was the previous run group. They took away the white spyder and replaced with a red R for us). The S was much faster than I anticipated. I was thinking it was a chick car until I drove it.

The Spyder was my favorite to drive. Not sure I'd want to live with it, though. On all those special cars, like the GTS, Cayman R, and Spyder, they have a seat that only adjusts fore/aft. You can't even adjust the recline. Makes it very uncomfortable for me.

Finally, for the road test, I chose the Panamera. I fell in love with that car. It is huge when you get in, but shrinks as you drive it. The base 6 cyl is much faster than I thought, too. And, while the PDK was annoying us on the track (more, I think, due to the slow drivers in front of us), it came to life on this test drive. Absolutely incredible device. Lightning fast shifts, and just as many as you want, as quick as you want.

Disappointment came at the end when I looked further into pricing. For some reason, I really thought the base Panamera started down around where the Cayenne does. Boy, was I wrong. I could actually get a Cayenne S, which is faster than the base Panamera and offers more room, for $12k less! Just for fun, I optioned up ""my"" Panamera online. A mere $84k. Again, I remind you this is with the BASE engine! Yikes!"

28,2011-06-13T22:36:20+00:00,qbrozen,"well, its smaller.
I think it is a much better looking car, personally.

Tough for me to compare comfort since I only drove the Cayman R vs a range of 911s.

I really didn't find the 2 comparable, though. Kind of like a 370Z vs a G37 coupe. You are getting a much more raw experience with the Cayman. Less room, lighter car, more of a toy than a tourer."

It still looks like a supersized few year old Azera to me, no matter how nice it is inside. Suede and soft leather would be expected at that price point, especially as it is likely a loss leader like the LS was.

Funny thing, the Phaeton has actually soldiered on in the EU market, selling at a trickle but still alive."
3,2011-06-16T20:04:42+00:00,ateixeira,"I agree - Equus seems like it started life as Korea's Lincoln Town Car, which basically ... it was.

They've updated it about as well as they could, but it's worthy of a clean sheet design.

Personally, I'd take a Genesis, nice enough, much cheaper, more modern design. 333hp is good. 29mpg is good. Both in the same car is great."

It's funny, when you get up there in price, you compete with non-automotive things. Ever notice how many yachts you see in luxury car commercials? Maybe they don't realize they are displaying alternatives. LOL

A while ago my wife chose a (not-on-the-water) beach condo over a BMW."

Just looked, $35,110 in stock at Fitzmall, and that's with the must-have premium package that slathers real cowhide all over your dash.

It may not be a full blown luxury car, but to me it's the tipping point where anything that costs more gives you diminishing returns.

I'd buy that over the $59k Equus and spend the $24k on...meh, I'm a wimp, I'd probably pre-pay my kids' college tuition or something."
7,2011-06-16T20:32:11+00:00,fintail,"Actually, if I had 59K to just blow on something vehicle related, I wouldn't buy a new car either. I'd maybe have the fintail restored, buy a cool bike, and invest the rest so it funds many nice vacations. I'm happy enough with my modern car.

Any Genesis I would want would top 40K as I want the tech goodies too. If I am jumping in I am going headfirst.

I think the yacht/car thing makes sense in an aspirational sense. It's much easier to buy and keep a car than a yacht, and a nice yacht is more chic than any car, so the marketers hope it will wear off on the car. People link big luxoboat with other fancy toys, but of course the majority of car owners don't have said toys."

VW does has a history of working with unions around the world - as does MB and BMW. That doesn't make this a slam dunk. It's up to the workforce to decide and if VW does things right, they won't vote it in."

Also there's a supercar luxury car show coming up on Sept 11 here in Vancouver with lots of very high end vehicles that will be there. Email me and I'll tell you more about it."
39,2011-07-31T21:56:54+00:00,fintail,"Sounds fun, probably more interesting working with exotics sold to sometimes shady people than dealing with Versas and Cubes all day. And having to look at the Quest can't be fun either.

I'll have to make it up there sometime. Unfortunately, Sept 11 is also The big local concours, which is an unmissable event here.

Send me an email whenever, I lost some address book material and I don't think I have yours anymore."

Other popular sightings were the new JGC and a couple of new Explorers. Saw 3 Acura ZDX's, a few ""new faced"" TL's and a slew of new and older MDX's. Guess I was paying more attention to and counting Acuras since the wife and I are talking about pulling the trigger on one soon...

44,2011-08-01T19:23:27+00:00,ateixeira,"I like the 5 door models. Tiny sedans have awkward proportions, not just the Accent but nearly all of them.

138hp, DI, 30/40 mpg. It's not just competitive - it's the new benchmark for its class.

Wifey had her car in for a recall and we got a Kia Rio loaner. I gotta say, econoboxes have come a long way. It's not even among the latest batch of models, but it had a driver's arm rests and the engine must have had 3 times the power of the beaters I drove as a poor college student.

Lemme look...110hp from that one. My 86 Chevy Sprint had 48 furious horses on a good day. I think my Datsun had 70 horses.

Even with an autotragic it could actually get out of its own way.

The new Accent, at 138hp, has 288% of the power I had in my Sprint.

Kids these days ... spoiled, I tell ya!"
45,2011-08-01T20:08:19+00:00,anythngbutgm,"lol, I think my 87' Olds Cutless 305 H.O. V8 only put out about 155hp. :surprise:

I don't think there is one single attractive minivan nowadays, since the boxy Dodge redesign came.

Odyssey = Oddity
Quest = boxy and bolt-upright
Mazda5 = can't wait for Nagare design language to be retired
R-Class = bulging eye balls, odd lines, shoulda copied B-class styling
Dodge = can't decide if it's boxy or rounded, fails at both

4'x8' dry wall? In the rain? Not a problem for the Toyota and Dodge, they fit hatch closed. Quest is too short, and per C&D Honda no longer fits a 48""x96"" sheet but the old one could.

I wonder if I'll down size for my next family vehicle, but I dunno, I'm totally spoiled. Maybe not until both kids are off to college, then I can downsize, but I may keep an old beater van as my utility vehicle."

I used to be a Nissan fan, especially the early 90s Sentra SE-R and 300ZX turbo, but lately Nissans leave me cold. Not a big fan of CVTs, the Sentra looks saggy, the Murano and Rogue have huge blind spots, the Juke appeals only to the blind, and the trucks have aged and are all overdue for updates.

I'll take a G or an M, but the crossovers from Infiniti all seem space inefficient so I'll pass on most of those, too."

14,2011-08-04T01:45:32+00:00,fintail,I think there is weird anime style in many Asian cars. These swoopy Hyundais could be in it too. Ever have a Leaf behind you in traffic? Looks like a dorky character from a cartoon.
15,2011-08-04T14:55:43+00:00,ateixeira,"Anime is a part of their culture, so that shouldn't really come as a surprise.

Polarizing style can be a good thing. Love/hate is better than indifference, because love sells cars, indifference does not.

Good example: Honda Element. When it came out, it added incremental sales for Honda, even though people hated it, and it's still often mentioned as being among the ugliest cars. The CR-V, it's big brother, actually moved to #1 on the sales charts after the Element came out, so they did not cannibalize each other.

Honda sold the CR-V to the conservative buyers, yet the Element brought in new and different buyers for its more quirky design.

It worked like a charm.

Joke's on us, I guess. I don't like the Juke, but it's doing just fine. Rogue is also doing well, so I'm sure Nissan would consider the Juke a hit, whether or not we like it.

Another thing - Gen Y grew up on anime. To them it's not strange, they may even see it as cool."

It's not only strange, most of the time it is ungainly on 4 wheels. Lots of lazy styling work there too (ie: make light clusters huge, be different for the sake of being different, etc)

Element was also aimed at hip younger people, but primarily sold to aging boomer hoarders to cart around their dogs and Costco purchases - same people who often love the CRV too.

I think as much as anything, reputation and price sells cars. Most drivers don't love their car or love driving, they love not walking."

More recently, look at the Fiat 500.

The problem with vehicles targeted at hip young people is that hip young people can't afford them. Mom or Dad buy for them and that's the age that the manufacturer reports. Beyond that is Mom and Dad do buy those cars for themselves."

35,2011-08-05T18:15:20+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, condition is everything, especially on an open car. You leave the top down for too long, the vinyl shrinks and gets brittle. Raise it and a 10+ year old top will tear. The interiors get *trashed* if they're left open all the time or if the top has a hole.

Also, low prices means just about anyone can afford one, and they're not taken care of like expensive, new cars are.

Mine was in good shape. I had replaced the top with a Robbins upgrade. It was clean but not immaculate. Crystal White paint was known for peeling but mine barely had the issue at all even after 13 years in the sun.

If you care for them, an NA Miata will actually appreciate at this age."

37,2011-08-05T18:26:44+00:00,ateixeira,"You can get a 6MT in a base Versa, too bad the French designed that awful shifter.

I still think a properly tuned powertrain in a Cube could be a hoot. Put the Juke's engine in there, with a 6MT.

Miata's can fit taller folks with simple mods - remove or modify the dead pedal, and modify the gas pedal, and you can gain a couple of inches.

Both of mine have been tweaked."
38,2011-08-05T18:32:54+00:00,fintail,"Hers isn't a manual, which is funny as the Miata was (and I respected her for that)

I also like some room in front of me, beside me, and above me. German sedans are often made with big Bavarians in mind, I always fit fine.

I'd think a Cube would need some suspension work too."
39,2011-08-05T18:46:04+00:00,ateixeira,"The Renault that the Versa was based on was a car that competed in a segment above where the Versa was here. In the USA you could get a Versa for $9995 there for a while. And it was roomy.

Thing is, Carlos ""le cost cutter"" Ghosn stripped it of any and all refinement, and they sold it here as an econobox. It could have been a good car... they just de-contented it to fit one price class below.

I actually like the basic platform more than the Sentra."

It was perhaps more a modern day BMW 2002 than the BMW 1 series is today. Boxy and upright, enough power, etc.

Boy did the Sentra fall off my radar. Frumpy redo and twist beams. Yuck.

Santa Fe is Hyundai's oldest product now, and it shows. Overdue for replacement. It got a nice V6 engine, but it's ready for a clean-sheet redo.

Kia just put a DI 4 banger in the Sorento, so the next Santa Fe should get that, and keep the nice V6 as an option."
43,2011-08-05T19:59:47+00:00,fintail,"Sentra is one of those cars that I can't explain why they sell.

I think Nissan is just big enough that, say, mom and dad will get one for their teenager to drive, just because that's what the dealer has in stock.

I agree - while I know they were trying to increase sales, putting in a back seat and door added weight, opposite of what the low-torque Wankel needed.

Speaking of which, it looks like it migh be the end of the road for the Mazda rotary. Not surprising, can you imagine how much money they have to spend developing that engine, for the very small volume of production?"

4,2011-08-10T20:01:58+00:00,fushigi,"That was my thought as well. I don't think the limited production is a problem as Mazda could have used the engine in other vehicles, but reliability and emissions weren't ever string suits from my understanding."
5,2011-08-10T21:00:35+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Actually, I've read that the Wankel is pretty darn reliable.

It's the thirst for oil that gave it the sour reception with cars like the RX-8. That, coupled with measely torque and a rev-happy nature (which I love btw) and the RX-8 had a limited audience unfortunately. That engine in anything other than the lightweigth quasi-coupe would have been a sales bomb IMO.

They could have used it on the Miata which would have rocked, big time, but I think it was a combination of cost, production availability and just the Miata's history of traditional engines that kept that from happening."

I'm a rag top kind of guy, but you miss out on the carbon fiber blades on the side, which sort of make that car. The Spider just looks like a long wheelbase TT.

a little bigger than I expected

I'm sure the new 500 dwarfs the old one, but it's still a light compact this day and age."

23,2011-08-17T15:36:07+00:00,stever,Finally spotted two in the wild. Around Ottawa the other day. They were cruising the freeway in moderate traffic and the drivers seemed comfortable enough dealing with the trucks and tourists. One was a business vehicle with logos plastered all over it.
24,2011-08-17T16:00:25+00:00,qbrozen,"oh, thanks for the reminder.

I spotted my first one not on a dealer lot a couple of weeks ago at, of all places, the autoX. I took a peek inside and it seems the backseat is more usable than I would have thought."

Don't throw stones. :P"
27,2011-08-18T14:16:49+00:00,ateixeira,"The difference was 80 lbs ... not significant. Reviews showed no measurable change in 0-60, plus all the weight is low and over the rear axle. Top it off, the PRHT model has the highest spring rates in the lineup.

80 lbs is the difference between before and after the all-u-can-eat buffet at Phillips Seafood. LOL"

Odd, but even though I know it is bigger, it looks smaller (by a lot) to me. I would be interested to see it side by side with a gen 1 model."
30,2011-08-21T03:06:49+00:00,kyfdx,"It's barely bigger than the old one.... I think it's mostly in width..

They seem so close in size..."
32,2011-08-22T16:09:25+00:00,stickguy,"I was interested in the X1 too. I know it has been delayed due to lack of supply (they can barely keep up with Euro demand) capacity.

one of the car mags last month said it was delayed until at least next spring. At this point, might as well wait for the next model update, and build it in S.C. too!"
33,2011-08-22T16:31:55+00:00,ateixeira,"Size comparo:

Per Edmunds the new X3 sizes:
# Width: 74.1 in.
# Height: 65.4 in.
# Length: 183.0 in.
# Wheel base: 110.5 in.

Wow, that wheelbase stands out to me, that's quite lengthy!

Per Consumer's Guide (not Reports, they are not related), the X1:
Wheelbase: 108.7 inches
Length: 175.4 inches
Width: 70.8 inches
Height: 60.8 inches

Also a long wheelbase, less than 2"" difference, wow. It is about 8"" shorter, probably more suited for tight U-turns in European streets.

Width varies more than the wheelbase does, LOL. I'm sure they made it narrow for Europe's narrow roads. It's also not nearly as tall.

I bet the X3 does actually feel roomier inside, with all that height and width, but for practical purposes the X1 really isn't that much smaller."
34,2011-08-22T16:40:34+00:00,texases,"Thanks for the info. Do they plan to bring over the X1? I'd like to see if the headroom is decent. I thought about the 128i, but I don't fit. Course, I imagine the NA 6 would no longer be an option. Too bad..."
35,2011-08-22T16:49:56+00:00,ateixeira,"It should get the 4 banger turbo, which debuts on the Z4 2.8i sDrive Long Pointless Name GT.

I do think we'll eventually see the X1, sure. Audi is brining a Q3 for those who feel the Q5 is too big (no one)."
36,2011-08-25T01:29:46+00:00,fintail,Today I saw both a new style Cayenne and an X6 on a car carrier. The douchiness emanating from that rig was almost enough to make me vomit. I wonder who will be taking delivery of those classy and tasteful chariots.

Also a new Focus yesterday."

They should have made it an Infiniti. At least you wouldn't balk at a $47k starter price.

I'd just get the Wrangler Unlimited. Two of them for that price. Or maybe a 4 door and a 2 door."

About 4 cars later, I saw another with this same treatment. It was then that I noticed the Hybrid badge. So, 2 Sonata Hybrids, both black, back-to-back."

4,2011-08-26T15:19:28+00:00,fintail,"But Nissan doesn't have quite the same brand equity, which is needed to pull of such prices. I agree that kind of bloated thing should have been an Infiniti, it would fit well with their other 8 flavors of wannabe SUVs aimed at affluent women with plenty of idle time, and the G cabrio that almost nobody buys."
5,2011-08-26T15:21:31+00:00,fintail,"Overstyled to the max. Really not one balanced part. Amusing thick wide badge chrome strip, hilarious leering eyes as if a blandbox will intimidate, huge gigantic mouth, and then there's the rest of the car. Has to be black or a very dark color to pull it off. Makes the Audi big mouth bass look appear to be refined and subtle."
6,2011-08-26T15:35:03+00:00,ateixeira,G cabrio is probably why Nissan got it. Infiniti already had a drop top.
7,2011-08-26T16:08:01+00:00,qbrozen,"didn't even see that. Both cars were black, so that is completely disguised. looked like it was just the little opening under the badge."
8,2011-08-26T16:17:11+00:00,fintail,"Z roadster is still offered, isn't it?"
9,2011-08-26T16:28:44+00:00,ateixeira,"Just looked, yup, $38k.

Still, they probably figured less overlap, since it has 2 seats, the G has...well the G only has 2 real seats as well.

My best bud married someone who works for Nissan, she gets nearly free leases on Nissans, and has driven a Maxima, then 370Z roadster, then Murano, so far.

It was fun but not comfortable the way a closed car is, at least from her perspective. Just had her first kid so I'm sure she likes her Murano more.

Wonder if she'll get a CrossCab next? Are there LATCH anchors in the back seat for kid seats?"
10,2011-08-26T16:43:16+00:00,tifighter,"Interesting review of the CrossCab here at-

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w45F-YVMJjA

Most reviews are from male hosts, this one from a female...different perspective.

As for the price, well, a Murano LE awd starts at $40k. Add another $2k for the nav package that comes STD with the CrossCab, which itself starts at about $47k. So you are looking at a price premium of about $5k for a convertible version...pretty standard compared to other brands, I think. I'm not saying they will sell loads of them, but they don't seem to be price gouging either."
11,2011-08-26T16:56:15+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, but hybrid makers do the same thing - make a whole bunch of unnecessary price padders standard.

7.6 cubic feet in the trunk (top down) is only very slightly more than in my Miata.

The back seat is adult-sized, though.

Kudos for taking risks, but I think I'd rather see an AWD Subaru Legacy convertible, based off the sedan. Keep just the roomy back seat."
12,2011-08-26T17:15:57+00:00,tifighter,"I hear you. I'm guessing the target was baby-boomers at the peak of their spending power, who have come to appreciate the higher seat height they've come accustomed to from the SUV's and CUV's they've been driving for the past 15 years. I'm also guessing the Murano has the highest income demographics of any of their mainstream products (i.e. GT-R doesn't count).

Anyhow, the woman I saw driving this seemed to fit this description...she was pulling into a country club; how stereotypical is that? If she can take a few of friends out to lunch in it, one of them likes it, tells HER friends about it and BOOM, enough grassroots marketing to hit their hopefully minuscule sales targets."
13,2011-08-26T17:48:02+00:00,ateixeira,"Yup, I'm sure their sales goals are very modest.

Anyone else think it would look a lot better if they lowered it?

And I don't mean 1 or 2"". I mean a FOOT. And ditch the silly dubs, 17"" rims would be just fine."
14,2011-08-26T17:57:00+00:00,fintail,"Lower it, small wheels, might as well just chop the top off an Altima coupe. Or just get the G37 cabrio, which can be had for more or less the same money."
15,2011-08-26T18:18:57+00:00,ateixeira,"Altima coupe would not have an adult-sized back seat. Its wheelbase is shorter than the sedan.

Same for the G - no back seat.

Very few convertibles seat 4. Wrangler doesn't have the refinement I want, but it may do."
16,2011-08-26T21:04:20+00:00,fintail,"There aren't many 4 full sized adult seater cabrios on the market anywhere - no market demand, it appears. How often would this actually be used? Just buy a gently used CLK or soon an E once depreciation works its wonders, if you need that. Even those aren't huge sellers."
17,2011-08-27T10:25:41+00:00,omarman,I was thinking the G37 vert does have a back seat.
18,2011-08-28T20:40:02+00:00,iwant12,"Saw a new 500 earlier this week. Have to say, it looked very small. There was a guy and gal inside, looked like they were a bit cramped."
19,2011-08-28T20:50:27+00:00,andys120,I saw one too and except for the size it looked remarkably like the original. OTOH it appeared to be roughly twice the size of the original.
20,2011-08-28T20:54:29+00:00,andys120,Ford's new subcompact is selling pretty well based on the number I saw this weekend on a 500 mile round trip (6 or 7). Most were four doors and all except one were dark gray or silver. The other one was an electric blue much more suited for a small car than the staid silvers and grays.
21,2011-08-28T23:08:13+00:00,iwant12,"Yeah, I saw the new one alongside the original--this site perhaps--and it's crazy just how much smaller the original is. You could remove the tires and it might fit in the back of my SUV! Personally, I like more metal around me than that."
22,2011-08-29T00:58:00+00:00,texases,"Wonder how the original 500 compares to the original Mini?

Saw my first 500 on the road today, red. It's OK, but I'm not a big fan..."
23,2011-08-29T11:17:43+00:00,andys120,"Wonder how the original 500 compares to the original Mini?

IIRC they were about the same size, just barely big enough to seat four adults (if they weren't too large)."
24,2011-08-29T13:37:30+00:00,ateixeira,"I meant it's tiny and not very useful...

If I sacrificed the back seat, the Fiat 500 looks interesting, even if it's not a full convertible.

E- and CLK- are soft tops, in that class I'd get a folding hard top 3 series.

I doubt I'll get anything like that though, to be honest. By the time my Miata is ready for trade, I'll have 2 tuition payments."

Loved my test drive in the 2011 C class last August, that alone was enough for me to just buy the car, but the wife would've really lost it...it really was/is a very nice interior!
Even the 2011 Cruze I sat in at the dealer was a nice step up for GM...comfortable seats with with decent fabric and a very ergonomic dash except for the lock/unlock button over by the radio and not on the door where it should be. Can just imagine how much nicer the Buick version will be! A little plasticy but a very fine attempt to say the least. And the new Camry picture of the dash does look very nice, a great improvement from the last generation. Looks like the Americans have been doing their homework!

From a Philly blog I visit:

""If you have a newer car in Philly, especially a Honda, invest in some locking lug nuts for your car! One of my neighbors came out the other morning to find both of her newer Honda's on milk crates! They were parked right under a street light no less. I haven't seen this in a long time around here.

Sad part is she is typically in Delaware all summer but came up to get away from IRENE and wound up rim less. All I caught on my camera's was 3 small Honda looking cars going down the block all together around 3:30 AM that morning.

Seems the ghetto rats are coming up to NE Philly to go midnight shopping again! Locking lug nuts are typically reasonably priced so pick up a set from the car dealer and it's one less thing you have to worry about. Just an FYI.""

BMW had a load of new 5ers, from lower line ~52K 528is up to a 77K or so (!!) 550i. Also had a 52K 335d, a few 7ers, and a couple new 650 cabrios, one which was just over 100K. Cars are getting expensive. Audi had a few A8s, most in the low 90s but one over 100K. A host of new style A6s, most in the 50s I think, an S5 for something like 66K, and various other models I didn't look at. Highline used dealer had a 2K mile CLK Black Series, I like...but the price is still insane. Come on, depreciation. Lexus dealer had a pretty bland selection - IS-F and a few CTs were the highlights, otherwise a pile of ES and IS, several IS cabrios, half a dozen HS, not a lot else."

I've been saying this for a while, remember in that other thread, you said a $30k plus loaded Optima was a lot of money?

Not any more...that's below average, for MSRP, I'd be willing to bet.

Anyone have the NADA average new car transaction price? I bet it's at $30k now."

45,2011-09-06T17:46:19+00:00,ateixeira,"I dunno, I remember when Aveo and Versa were both under $10k.

Now a Fiesta (saw a new one this morning, to stay on topic) well equipped is high teens, and a loaded Focus (also saw a 5 door today) is mid 20s.

The dollar ain't what it used to be, literally. I'd say, for well equipped, expect to pay:

econobox: $16-18k
compact: $18-25k
mid-size sedan: $20-35k, more for hybrids

Last year at the auto show, an Equinox was $39k and an Explorer and Durango were both near $50k. FIFTY GRAND!

Loaded minivans are mid 40s.

40k is near lux, real lux is 50k plus. As fin pointed out, plus a LOT.

Having said that, today's ""econobox"" has DI, 6 speeds, and more in-car tech than a 1990 luxury car did, by a wide margin."

Weak dollar and wealth consolidation trends have a bit to do with it, no doubt.

And yeah, 30K+ for a mainstream model from an economy car maker is still too dear, at least for me.

For all the expense of these cars, as you say, they do have a lot of features. Basic cars 20 years ago were really pretty basic still."

Euro is killing the dollar. Heck, pretty soon the Brazilian Real will be ahead of the dollar. I remember my dollar bought 3.5 Reais, today it's 1.653. My dad retired in Brazil and is moving back here! I never imagined that would happen.

Keep in mind a 30k price tag is going to sell for $27k or so street price. You're not looking at new cars, but for those who are, this is the new reality.

I remember back in college, before I had my first real job, I got a '91 Escort GT. It was all about bang-for-the-buck. I wanted A/C, a cassette player (LOL), and something fun. Paid a little under $11k, but in today's dollars that's about $18 grand, I think.

For that money I got a 5 speed with 127hp. The Sonic, Accent, and Rio all make 138hp and come with 6 speeds. All have more torque, much fancier audio systems, more airbags than the Escort had seat belts (motorized mice, annoying as heck). I bet quality control is at least twice as good, if not seven times.

I'm not sure if they lift the inside rear wheel, but equipped the right way they should be fun little cars.

College kids shopping for a first set of wheels may not have it so bad after all. They'll likely pay less than I did, adjusted for inflation, and get a lot more."
48,2011-09-06T18:51:44+00:00,qbrozen,"I dunno, I remember when Aveo and Versa were both under $10k.

yes, and they were also in a very small class.

It wasn't long ago that most people wouldn't consider anything classed lower than mid-sized. But now, as you suggest, compact and even subcompact are so ""nice"" to live with that it is tougher to argue for a mid-sizer.

Certainly, compact and subcompact sales are on the rise. The numbers have been shown to support this. So, even with the constantly rising prices, it MAY be that the average will decrease. Although it only takes 1 exotic to offset 20 sub-$20k compacts and push the average to $30k."
49,2011-09-06T18:55:38+00:00,fintail,"The German makers really have to be cutting profit margins to be making it right now - as the E isn't really more expensive, A6 is actually cheaper, 5er only seems barely more expensive...the difference comes from somewhere. Euro has to be set for a fall, perhaps the most overvalued currency on the planet, as bad in its way as the Yuan is undervalued. If we'd stop providing defense for the continent, the Euro would fall fast. I wonder who is benefiting from this.

I don't know if most college kids can ante up for a new car without being on the parental dole, but used cars are also so much better now than 20 years ago - a 3 year old car today is going to be worlds better than a new car in 1991. For some makes (Subaru, Honda, etc) used doesn't make sense, but for most, it can be a bargain."

I couldn't agree more...who will it be to finally bring it crashing down? Italy, perhaps? Their economy is big enough to have that sort of impact, unlike Greece.

Good subcompacts are crucial, IMHO, because they introduce people to a brand. If they're happy with a Kia Rio, they will get an Optima next, maybe later a Veredus if they are successful (that's the upcoming big RWD sedan).

My Ford Escort experience taught me that light is fun, hatchbacks offer utility, and DOHC produces good bang for the buck (in terms of fuel costs). Unfortunately, the trim pieces falling off also taught me to avoid Ford next time around.

Ford's bad service reinforced that, too. I had rust on the fuel filler neck, and their solution? Free undercoating. Not even close...

Regarding Brazil, it too has more than its fair share of problems, as you know of course...including huge socio-economic issues that make ours pale in comparison, high crime, corruption and law enforcement sector abuse that makes our authorities look like angels, and so on.

That Ford dealer closed, Ourisman in Bethesda. Can't say I shed a tear over that one, though the lot sits empty to this day. I wish another brand would pop up there.

I did take my brother to test drive an Escape, though we both ranked it dead last.

I would consider an Explorer EcoBoost if they added AWD, to replace the minivan down the road.

Focus 5 door would be on my short list for small cars, too. Fiesta is a little too small and my co-worker already replaced her trans. Convertible Mustang is interesting, too. Fusion is dated and the Mercury clone I test drove was boring even in a boring segment. Taurus SHO is too big, but I'd rent one, sure. Flex and Edge are heavy, I'd rather see the new Kuga.

F150 EcoBoost would be my pickup choice, too. Tundra is too plasticky, Silverado seems dates, and Dodge markets to neanderthals too much for my tastes.

Brazil has tremendous potential.

Looks more like an A7, sort of, but very Kia, like a big Optima.

Tone down the concept crap and it could actually be handsome, better than the 5 GT for certain.

Kia has a shot, again if the dealers are up to par. You get a 40mpg Rio, then move up to a sedan but you still want 35mpg or so - bingo, Optima. 33mpg even with the turbo. The Genesis V6 still manages 29mpg even with 333hp, so the Veredus would be a logical step up from there.

http://www.motorweek.org/reviews/road_tests/2011_kia_sportage_sx_turbo

We averaged 25.0 miles per gallon of regular, or about the same as the less spirited standard engine

Same engine, so I'm sure it would do much better in normal driving.

For kicks, not direct competitors, but other turbo crossovers in their care got:

20.1mpg on premium in the X3
21mpg on premium with their RDX
22.4mpg on premium with the Forester XT
20mpg on premium with the Mazda CX7

Only the Forester came close. Newer CX7 turbos are tuned for regular gas.

HyunKia may be the new Honyota, but I haven't seen the feverish loyalty and obsession just yet. Both also made a number of legitimate enthusiast cars at one time, will be interesting to see if their replacements can do likewise. Kia also needs an image boost to get some brand equity, and a classier dealer system."

The name Magnette has been chosen as I gather they thought MG6 was a bit bland - although it isn't a name most people under about 50 would be familiar with, as the last ones were made in the mid 60's...

I think MG are the only new Chinese cars sold in UK, although I regularly see a Wuhan microbus - that has Polish plates though...

Also saw two of the new Range Rover Evoques on a car transporter, when coming down from Northern England last Monday - a three door and a five.. I think the launch is this weekend, so I suppose these were dealer demonstrators - they were with about six Discovery's / R-R Sports etc.

Not sure about the Evoque - while it looks good from some pictures I've seen, it isn't so great in white like these two were - looked like something had dropped on the roof of the end one, but that might have been just the angle - it was hanging on the back of the trailer."

I also saw quite a few Audi A4 Cabrios, I think they're beginning to outsell the BMW 3 Cabs. I did see quite a few 3er coupes, I think they're outselling the 'verts, not the case in the prior generation (E46).

I also saw a black Ferrari California Spider w top down. In person they look quite a bit better than in photos but nowhere near is beautiful as their namesake from the 60s.

I spotted my first Mitsu Lancer five-door and was surprised how good it looked. It's a near ringer for the Focus 5-dr. of which I saw several.

Today, the huge sunglasses and botox crowd loves their (imagined) rugged, individualistic, and stylish SUV or crossover which are perfect for venturing to every destination from the aesthetic improvement center to the gallery mall. I'd take the wagon. I am surprised it is offered, as BMW has dropped the 5er Touring here...but Audi seems to sell a few wagons still.

18,2011-09-12T19:37:02+00:00,andys120,The E-Wagon is still popular in New England where it's always been favored by old money Yankees with dogs or boating gear to haul around.
19,2011-09-12T19:53:25+00:00,ateixeira,"Let's see, per Edmunds, starting prices:

E wagon: $57,150
M: $46,490
GLK: $35,500

Yeah, a good bit cheaper, and that's the 2012 M class, too.

Looks like the C wagon is gone from the US? It would also have cost more than the GLK here.

I've driven the previous ML and E, but neither was my cup of tea.

Also drove the last X5 and 5 wagon, and in that case the wagon was a whole lot more satisfying to drive. By a wide margin, surprisingly.

550GT drives OK (not as good as the previous one) but the roads I was on didn't really let me try it out properly. High price means I'll pass anyway."
20,2011-09-12T20:00:58+00:00,fintail,"C wagon has been gone for some time, the W203 version didn't sell a ton either. Strange thing about the new E wagon is that we get in gas only - I would imagine the wagonistas would like a diesel.

GLK is somewhat of a bargain in base form, compared to its brand and other brand competition. Options list can make you wince, though.

I like the W212, reminds me kind of an old W124, seems to be a better quality product than the previous (W211) E."
21,2011-09-12T20:13:51+00:00,ateixeira,"E wagon diesel might get real spendy, though. $60 grand base, maybe.

I wonder how many base model GLKs dealers order, probably not many.

Fair enough, though, the X3 costs more, and by the time BMW brings the X1 here, the X3 will creep up in price even more.

I liked the W211 better. Lady lawyer next door has one. It just seemed cleaner, more consistent styling nose to tail.

The W212 has those odd, separated headlights. Also, I doubt many Benz shoppers read it, but Consumer Reports actually scored the W211 higher overall.

Both too big/heavy for my tastes. Tested one with Edmunds member RSHolland, he loved it, I liked the C- and SLK better."
22,2011-09-12T20:24:29+00:00,fintail,"Diesel W212 sedan costs essentially the same as a gas, I can't imagine why a wagon would be different. The wagon bases at 56K, so maybe 57K for the diesel - which means 60K is there with just a few options. Resale will be higher too.

There should be some base GLKs out there for lease specials, probably no different than anything else - base C class are easy to find, just like base 3ers and A4s.

The main drawback of the W212 to me is the exterior styling, as I call it, ""German Acura"". But the build quality and materials of those I have experienced seem better than the old W211, which really had some issues especially in earlier years, no matter what CR might claim. Foreign media also reports the W212 to be a step up. Not a sporty car though, not intended to be, unless you go AMG."

CT will be a real success, virtually Prius money for something less dorky looking, with the Lexus badge and dealer experience. IMO the most appealing product they have that is relatively affordable."

37,2011-09-14T21:10:46+00:00,fintail,"I wonder if marketing is even trying with the HS anymore. Might be a short run.

I've seen several CT in my area, not beside a Prius though. I visited the dealer last week, they had a few, all base models, 31K sticker, same as a decently equipped Prius, but without the stigma."
38,2011-09-14T21:18:02+00:00,ateixeira,"HS didn't do as bad as many people think. They sold over 7k last year, and remember the price was higher.

As soon as the CT came out, though, it's newer and cheaper, looks better, and is a lot more fuel efficient (which is all that matters to a hybrid buyer). They'll be lucky to sell 3k of the HS this year.

CT will easily exceed it's 10k goal, maybe by 10-20%.

It's also beating the BMW 1 and creaming the Audi A3. Not just A3 TDI, all A3 models."

CT is in a lucky place - good price, some features, image with both status and green - the Prius crowd will love it as an aspirational vehicle, and those sell a lot more than 1ers or A3s."

IMO that's what any sensible car buyer would do. Why spend $15K or more for a car that is basically useless for any road trip over 100 miles, and can leave you stranded, since it's harder finding a charging station than a gas station in at least 49 of 50 states? Not to mention the 8-hour charging time compared to the 8-minute filling time at a gas station.

And no, you won't see an overall cost savings after 10 years of ownership, unless you're trading in an H2."

And no, you won't see an overall cost savings after 10 years of ownership, unless you're trading in an H2.

Keep in mind that not everybody buys a car for the same reason. In many cases, the cost savings isn't the factor - it's the ""doing something"" factor that drives the purchase.

In reality, anything with a 40 mile range would work for me as a commuter - I drive about 35 miles per day to and from work. Either would work although I prefer the Volt's technology in case I needed to do divert from my route or forget to charge it. Further, it would cost me about $1 a day to charge either vs. the $5 or so I spend now for gas."

47,2011-09-15T15:29:51+00:00,fushigi,"I agree about the ""doing something"" factor. And without early adopters who are willing to pay the premium for new tech we'd never see significant advances.

Still, the premium for the Leaf & Volt are pretty high.

A little price relief is on the way, though. Mitsubishi's i (a.k.a. i-MiEV) is coming out shortly. It offers slightly less range than the Leaf but costs thousands less. $21,625 after fed rebate base price v. the Leaf's $27,700. It's even RWD. I've seen the i a couple of times and hope to ride in it a little over a week from now at Factory MOD. Not that I'm in the market for an EV but I am curious to drive in something silent."

Actually, down here in San Diego, it is funny who the fastest drivers often are. I would say it's random, but tends to be a vehicle that shouldn't really be driving so fast.

The Sonata is a standout design but the Optima is a bit more subtle but if you look at it for a minute it really flows together and it's very sleek and modern. I took a peek at the interior which featured a very nice tight weave fabric and attractive stitching.

I could see a couple of downsides though. It's really gotten big, as in Accord/Malibu size which IMO is too big for a FWD sedan (not that anyone agrees w me on that).

They ignored the fact that the long sloping rear glass would accommodate a big hatch very nicely, vastly increasing the potential utility of the car without compromising the looks.

Inside as well, the Optima has a more driver-focused cockpit.

I test drove one - very nice, but not fun to drive. The steering is a bit numb (I have yet to find electric PS that I like), and the clutch and shifter were not rewarding in the way the Kia Sportage was. Surprising.

I do think it's the size issue. It's big and heavy, and this segment wants low NVH control, hence the isolated steering. I'm sure it's no worse than most others in this segment, actually better than the new Passat, but that's not saying much.

Overall I think the Optima serves its segment well, may as well get the automatic and recommend it to your aunt or uncle.

For a driver's car, we'll have to wait and see what they do with the Kia GT.

What I don't get is that Kia is supposed to be sportier than Hyundai, but when you look at, for instance, Rio vs. Accent, the Rio only puts a manual trans on the base model, while the Accent offers a manual across the board. And manuals on the smaller cars are actually entertaining, and feel better than the Optima's stick shift.

I realize 99.9% of cars are automatics nowadays but Kia needs to re-package their cars so that sportier models (not cheaper ones) come with manuals."

On Sunday saw a Lexus IS-C with not only the top down, but also passengers in the back seat! That's a first, and it was an adult, not a child. I didn't think that was possible given the size.

But the GT (looks like they are dropping the weird name, good for them) will be even bigger and heavier...maybe they need to import some German suspension tuners too.

I have yet to see an IS-C with the top down, and I see a few of them in this area. Heck, a Lexus with the sunroof open is probably pretty rare."

Nah it doesn't offend me in the least.

If I was making fun of a cheapo car or a skinflint owner, would it be so bad?

IMHO, it would be just as bad.

50% of the cars ostentatious poser objects? Nah. IMO, 90% of cars are some variation of a toaster or refrigerator.

Perhaps 90% of the cars on the road are pedestrian but IMHO at least 50% of the models offered could be considered poseur objects. Any BMW/MB/Audi/Cadillac/et al SUV/CUV could fall into this category. The M/AMG/R/V nameplates are pretty much all bought to be look at me cars. King Ranch and Denali variants will never see the duty their underlying structure was designed for. Most hybrids, electrics and even diesels are bought for their smugness. Heck, my new Explorer could be considered a poseur - it screams ""I've been driving a minivan for 10 years and am sick of it."" My wife will readily admit it.

IMO, outside of Camcords, stripped F150's and minivans all vehicles are bought for their ability to convey an image we want to have.

People are free to buy what they like, and I am free to opine about said purchases, and they are free to opine about mine.

That' fine. I just wish you would lay off the douchebagerry phrases. You seem like a pretty smart person - your words sometimes lend themselves to a ""better than thou"" image.

I don't think 50% of the cars sold are useless highline SUV/CUV and prestige cars. Camcords and Civrollas are the majority (well, I guess we can throw Elantnatas into that too), and they don't offend at all - they are just transportation pods. Even soft roaders of the same ilk, no reaction. I don't see the Explorer as really being a poser, it's just a family bus. But I live in an area where there are plenty of trust fund/satellite children [non-permissible content removed] tooling around (that works on a few levels :P ) in new M3s, X6s, and so on.

Genesis without a diesel wouldn't sell there, and IMO the market would be very in tune to it being kind of an E60 knockoff - especially if priced above the Grandeur (aka firmly into legit 5er territory).

I don't think they should focus there at all - go to Brazil, China, and India. Those markets have growth potential. In Brazil Hyundai never had the baggage it had here, so it's veiwed as a premium (not luxury) brand. A Santa Fe costs more than a RAV4 in Brazil, while here Hyundai tends to price cars lower than Toyota."

Most people would just pick the 5 door Accent, I suppose, but I guess their market research suggests less overlap if they did this oddball coupe.

I don't think it needs 270+hp, it's small and light. 180hp or so would be plenty if they kept it light. They have the Genesis coupe if you wanna go big on power, that thing's getting the 333hp DI version of the 3.8l V6.

I think a Veloster at 138hp, then 180hp or so, then step up to a 2l Turbo Gen coupe or the V6. They've got good spacing and every price category covered that way."

A turbocharged version of the Elantra's DI 1.8 should be good for 180-210HP easily without much of an economy penalty, say 26 city/37 highway. The 1.8 feels pretty good in my wife's new Elantra. The power delivery & smoothness are, IMO, a good match for the size & type of vehicle.

Then again, Nissan is getting 188HP from their turbo 1.6 in the Juke so maybe apply a turbo to the regular Veloster's 1.6 powerplant would be sufficient (though the Juke does want premium gas)."

Think of this as the CRX HF. If you recall, that was the fuel sipper. My roommate had one of those. It could barely get out of its own way, but I don't ever recall her buying gas, LOL.

The turbo would be the modern day CRX Si. Hyundai hopes so."
48,2011-10-12T16:38:02+00:00,ateixeira,Juke power levels would be fine. This is lighter and lacks AWD. Too much and you'll get torque steer and it will try to rip the front half of the car away from the back half.

To keep things in perspective some models were under a ton.

Veloster weighs more than the Accent, while the CRX weighed less than the Civic Si. That is where the Veloster falls short."

That's precisely where I disagree.

Honda sells roughly, oh, a billion Civics.

My mom told me a million times not to exaggerate, so let's see ... Honda has sold 167k so far this year. I bet mid 90s it was higher.

VW sells about a dozen Golfs.

Again, can't live with the guilt of exaggerating, so VW sold less than 14k Golfs so far this year.

So easily more than 10 to 1 sales. Actually closer to TWELVE to 1.

You might see 10 molested Civics for every 3 Golfs, but those 3 still represent a much higher percentage of that 1/12th sized fleet.

And it's not just Golfs, it's also Jetta, A3s, A4s, anything with the 1.8T in particular. How many are chipped?

Who DIDN'T chip their 1.8T is more like it.

A Civic with a park bench spoiler offends you more so you notice them more, I get that. But you haven't not seen 1/12th as many Golfs similarly ruined? I'd agrue Golfs are over-represented by a factor of 3 or so.

The worst part is this is a gathering of water-cooled Vee Dubs, so basically you take away all the cars with personality.

Chipping an engine and attaching all kinds of weight-adding junk are different ideals, to me. Most of these modified Hondas have no actual peformance gains, it is all about ""look at me"", these are like 4 wheeled Harleys."

I'm not impressed with the Genesis coupe, I guess you just haven't been in discussions about that car. It lacks the sedan's interior ""niceness"".

You've seen me be critical of the manual shifter of the Kia Optima, too. My brother didn't like it either, and he crossed that off his list. I didn't try the automatic.

I'm not in to sedans, Hyundai would have to make a Genesis wagon if they wanted me to come in for a drive.

The Sportage was actually nice. Terrible visibility, but it drove well, and I preferred its clutch and steering over the Optima.

You know I'm a Subaru guy and Fitz Subaru happens to be a joint Subaru/Hyundai showroom. So when I check out an Outback, inevitably I sit in the Genesis next to it. It (the sedan) is one of the very few cars in the market with a sticker price that is lower than you expect."

Genesis coupe makes me wonder why it is called a Genesis, as it doesn't really appear related to the sedan at all. It's not a bad car, but I don't know if it is really an upmarket product. The G37 isn't shaking in its boots.

Good question.

You could say MazdaSpeed3, WRX, GTI, but the main appeal is RWD, so then does it compete with the american pony car set? Without a V8, though? Or maybe a 370z? Miata?

I guess the Scion FRS and Subaru BRZ (dumb name) will compete to some extent.

It's a bit unique, RWD without a big engine. Hyundai missed in not offering the sedan's MUCH better interior. It could have been a G37 coupe competitor, but it falls short. Also, their stick shifts are hit-or-miss and this one misses, a big faux pas in this class.

Coupe may be sized like the G37c, but the Genesis sedan is a lot bigger than the G37 sedan, I believe.

We should keep in mind what things cost nowadays, the cheapest AMG (C class) is $59+ grand base, $61.4k for the coupe. ***Ouch***"
16,2011-10-18T17:53:25+00:00,fintail,"Will the FRS and BRZ ever really exist? I can't say I believe it just yet. Toyota is playing a risky game in creating insane hype about upcoming models - it creates expectations that are tough to meet.

I think with some of the wannabe upward mobility at Hyunkia, they indeed thought the Gen coupe could compete with the G - I can't see it being similar to anything else. Ponycar people want available big engines and like domestic rides anyway. The other hot cars aren't RWD and are somewhat less mature. I don't know.

The similarity in the Gen coupe to the G not being similar in the Gen sedan is more proof of the wrong name being given to the coupe. The Gen sedan wants to play with the 5ers etc, something the coupe could never approach.

IS-F and M3 are pretty much the same price too. E63 can pass 100K without all options being selected."

I finally sent my 2001 Nissan Quest out to pasture. What a great vehicle. It had hit 200,000 miles and was in need of a total front and rear brake job, new timing belt, new struts in front and possibly new tires. It had also developed a case of rust cancer - not visible from the outside - but getting worse by the day. Thre rear speakers no longer worked, the rear wiper was broken, the headlights were weak from day one and it was stricken with a bad case of the rattles. It was time to go.

The van was tough, flexible and worked quite well as tow vehicle. It was one of the best purchases I ever made. It has been replaced by a 2011 Chrysler Town and Country with a towing package. Despite having the van for about two months, I have rarely driven it. I just can't seem to pry it out of my wife's hands. She loves it. I just hope it proves to be the tank that our old Quest proved to be.

Inside, though, Toyota cut too many costs, and some of the soft-touch stuff from my 2007 was de-contented. So for interiors I'd take an Odyssey or Quest, even though I can't stand the exteriors.

Just talked to my buddy (who is married to a Nissan staffer), and they currently have a Ramada and an Altima 2.5S in their fleet. They're thinking about a Quest to replace the big SUV to reduce the gas bills, and a Juke to replace the Altima.

It's just gotten old, your criticism is always directed at the Asians. Even when you complement them it's back-handed. Always.

First full month's sales were strong - 3700 or so. In about 3 months it will outsell the full year's worth of CR-Z sales. I realize it's not a hybrid, but it's a green hatch and that's how Hyundai is positioning it.

The turbo model will launch soon. Turns out they were waiting for the Genesis coupe to get 2 upgraded engines (333hp on the V6, 270 or so on the turbo) to make room beneath it for the Veloster turbo.

3724 Velosters sold, and Accent sales only dipped by 500 or so, so not too much cannibalization.

Sonata still growing, though Optima sales are growing more. Elantra is hot. Santa Fe is hot and the funny thing is it's an ancient design. Tucson did well. Azera was phased out and the new one's not really out yet. Even the Genesis improved.

They're on a roll, basically.

And the funny thing is Hyundai is the bad one, Kia is doing better. the Optima along gained 7000 sales vs. a year ago. Kia is up 106k sales for the year, incredible.

The Koreans are doing well NOW. Whine about a bailout all you want but it paid off dearly for them.

Where's the affordable performance car from Europe? The light sports cars? They'd abandoned those in search of bloated profit makers. How many cars (trucks, lately) do they make under 2 tons? Besides FWD VWs.

Does an X6 have a BMW's soul? What about a Porsche with a VW V6 engine? No way, they're total sell outs.

Sure, I look back and give respect to the BMW 2002, just as I do a Datsun 510. I'd go as recent as the E36 M3, the Elise, or a Boxster. Everything since seems to be more and more complex.

The Koreans stumbled and sputtered for some time even with bailouts and much other coddling. I really don't have a problem with it, but let's not make it look like this is all independent success, and those here who cry about the domestic bailouts yet love Hyunkia need to think about it.

Hyunkia is making some fine appliances now, but still aren't up to speed for design or driving for those who want to exceed the lowest common denominator. A few bright points, many more meh points."

Don't the Germans enjoy similar coddling at home? How much are imports taxed? I'd say everyone enjoys some home field advantage.

That's a fair statement, but I was pro-bailout, as you know. I also know who you are referring to, but he's not active in this thread.

I'm not even decided on the Veloster. Part of me thinks it's odd, another part likes the affordable fun angle. Prices start at $16k and it only weighs about 2600 lbs, so I give them credit.

Even if we allow $10 grand more to set a price limit, the only interesting/fun car from Germany is the GTI and it weighs over 3000 lbs.

I guess I'm sour over the fact that Germany created the affordable pocket rocket class, then adandoned it."

It looks like both come equipped basically the same other than the wheels (which comes to a $2k MSRP difference in the end, and a $1520 difference per TMV). And, yes, of course the Veloster gets better mileage, in exchange for much less utility and comfort. The usual trade-off it seems.

If we are talking about an enthusiast that wants a GTI, that's not a person looking at the Veloster anyway.

Anyhoo, whole point is that Germany hasn't exactly ditched the hot hatch category altogether, as you suggested. Is 3k lbs excessive? Yeah, maybe. But it would be tough and very expensive to build something as roomy and solid with less mass."

A 2600 lbs car is going to feel quite a bit different than a 3000 lbs car. Let's see if Hyundai can avoid bloat when it adds the turbo model.

I guess I'd be happy to see a Polo GTI here, as I think that's more of a modern 1984 GTI than the actual new GTI is."
38,2011-11-03T15:59:49+00:00,qbrozen,"The bloat will depend on all that they change. If they start putting on bigger brakes and wheels, you'll probably see a good 250-lb increase. If it is JUST bolting on turbo parts, look for more like 100-150 lb add-on.

Surprisingly, the GTI is only about 150-lb heavier than the Golf. I suppose that 1 less cylinder offsets all the other upgrades.

Isn't the latest word that they ARE bringing the Up! car here? Wonder if they'll do a performance version of that.

I'll tell ya, I appreciate low weight ... but only to an extent. It isn't everything. In autocrossing my 3 different cars this year, I found my GTI to be the most fun, even moreso than my '85 MR2.

My '10 GT turns 2 next month. By then I might just pass 20K miles. I definitely keep my cars a while; to do otherwise would be financially silly. Of course, top make them palatable to keep a long time I do tend to only buy high trim lines, but still, spending an extra $2-3K up front gives me a car I'll enjoy for 8-10 years so it's worthwhile to me.

Sales-wise Mitsu's been on a roll. Measured in percentage points they're consistently up 40-70% each month compared to the prior year. But coming from sales of under 6K/month that means they're steadily doing 8500-9K+ now. Invisible, as you say, when compared to the big guys.

Since their growth rate is outpacing industry average growth, technically they're taking market share from others. The big question is what happens when Galant/Endeavor/Eclipse are no longer offered. Will the i EV be a success? As the cheapest EV in the US it should be, but you never know.

Operating-wise, all I've done is 3 oil changes & 2 tire rotations.

2,2011-11-18T15:06:26+00:00,ateixeira,Stylists seem to get precedent over the engineers too often nowadays.
3,2011-11-18T16:05:19+00:00,robr2,Well juice - most consumers don't look for the cool wiring harness or brake lines designed by the engineers...
4,2011-11-18T17:16:18+00:00,ateixeira,"True, but I guess I like to see function designed-in.

When I hear that a side mirror is dimpled because it reduces drag and wind noise, well, that's just cool. :shades:

Basically, I like design more than just extraneous styling."
5,2011-11-20T01:28:46+00:00,stickguy,"fits based on their expanded criteria! And remember, Toyota sells a to of Camrys every year, so no accounting for taste.

Admittedly, it&#146;s a subjective tally. Dwindling sales are one way to determine an automotive flop. Excessive hype before a launch, with media silence afterward (see: Acura ZDX) is another. So is a round of scathing reviews from auto critics, or a Consumer Reports rating that places it among the 10 worst values of the year (see: Dodge Nitro)."
6,2011-11-20T02:17:02+00:00,fintail,"New unplated Fit in my parking garage, looks to be absolute bottom of the line, plastic hubcaps and all, no visible options other than automatic (of course)."
7,2011-11-20T20:22:06+00:00,fintail,"Saw an SLS cabrio this morning...I really want one of these, but I still prefer the coupe, head banging on the doors and all. It's wincingly expensive, but IMO is a lot of presence and performance for the money when compared to a base Italian supercar. Also saw one of the new big butt Prius."
8,2011-11-21T03:46:22+00:00,fintail,"Also saw a Sonic today, white 4 door hatch"
9,2011-11-21T06:07:57+00:00,tifighter,"Went to the SF auto show this weekend, and saw some new things in the flesh for the first time:

2013 Ford Escape - I know people liked the old boxy shape, but this thing looks pretty nice in person. I like it...might be a nice car for my wife with the smaller ecoboost engine.

2013 Cadillac XTS - Not bad. Has some presence. They had it up on the rotating stage, and a bunch of older guys were giving the presenter a bad time about not being able to come up and sit in it. Auto show hecklers, who knew? But, at least people seemed interested in it.

12 Ford Flex - People like this car, its just expensive. Families would walk over, look at it and gush. Then they would look at the sticker. Display unit was a Limited AWD stickering at $47K, and this wasn't an ecoboost. Who is this car targeting?

12 Fisker Karma - Its just too over the top in person. I liked what I saw in photos, but it just doesn't translate for me in real life. Tesla Model S all the way.

12 Subaru Impreza 5-door - Subaru got the packaging right on this car. I'm 6'2"", and after adjusting the drivers seat where I'd want it, I then sat in the second row behind the driver. Pretty comfortable, and a major surprise; if my 06 forester would have been this accommodating to adults in the back, I might have kept it longer. Cargo area looks good, too.

12 Hyundai Veloster - It feels like you're sitting in a video game. It was surrounded by college age kids, so Hyundai must be happy about that.

12 Scion iQ - Yep, three people fit.

12 Mclaren MP4-12C - in dark red. Its okay, but didn't really knock me out. Looks smaller than a 458, but it might be a styling illusion.

12 Nissan Quest - Like it. Nice interior, and functional. The press gave Nissan a bad time about the cargo loss from the higher floor, but its only on paper. Still has a huge well behind the third row for bodies golf clubs. Floor to ceiling is 39 inches compared to 43 inches (all hand measured by me) for the Ody and Sienna. Four inches; big deal.

12 Nissan CrossCabrio - Surrounded all day. I overheard numerous women say ""I love it!"" Could this one be a slow burn?

12 Chevy Spark - I barely remember it. Not sure what that means. BTW, Chevy stand was surprisingly small, but they did have the 13 Malibu, which was a surprise.

12 Nissan Leaf - These have been out for quite a while, but when I walked past one on display (they had 3 placed all around the show, as well as a test drive loop inside the trade hall), it was surrounded by a bunch of middle aged guys wearing real-tree camo jackets. They were asking the Nissan rep lots of questions; is this a sign of future wider acceptance? Who knows.

12 Infiniti QX - Go ahead and laugh, but I like it. Interior is seriously top notch.

12 (13?) - Infiniti JX - Pretty underwhelming in person.

Older cars - Funny that segment trailers like the Expedition, FJ Cruiser, Lincoln MKT seemed really popular, with lots of people checking them out. Morbid curiosity, perhaps?

Honda booth - compared to others, noticeably quiet. Scary, in fact. I think they might be in trouble now, tsunami or not. No one looking at the new Civics. Acura had a RL in the center of their booth. Ouch. No ZDX, though.

That's enough; I could on forever. I enjoy the cars, brand and people watching at a car show."
10,2011-11-21T14:34:41+00:00,lemko,...red Cadillac CTS coupe on Tabor Avenue near Ripley in NE Philly.
11,2011-11-21T15:45:04+00:00,ateixeira,"Color me envious! That's pretty cool, to see the new models so soon.

I'll be doing the DC auto show, which is right after NAIAS, when it comes to town."
12,2011-11-21T15:46:42+00:00,ateixeira,"A case of ""looks better in person"". Not as odd as I expected up close, in the flesh. From behind it looks like a more curvaceous CR-Z, so I get why they compare those.

This one was white, and stood out from the crowd, in a nice way."
13,2011-11-21T16:25:15+00:00,fintail,"I have to agree on that one. While not pretty, it is cool in its own way, and I want it to catch on. If people moved out of Corollas the like into those, the roads would be more interesting.

Speaking of new cars, local free car rag from the grocery store has a Hyundai dealer with a sweetheart Equus lease, something like $2995 down and $700/month."
14,2011-11-21T17:24:11+00:00,lemko,I hope you're kidding about the Equus. There are a lot nicer cars I could lease for $700 a month if I was reckless and self-destructive enough to do so.
15,2011-11-21T17:27:33+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah ... that's over $28 grand for 3 years.

I'd buy a new Genesis and keep that forever instead."
16,2011-11-21T17:53:56+00:00,fintail,"That's what the ad said. Of course, this is a car with a 65K MSRP. There are a nicer/cooler/more interesting cars I could finance for $700/month, that don't cost anywhere near 65K...which is part of the problem with that thing."
17,2011-11-23T17:39:38+00:00,ateixeira,On I-270 heading north yesterday.
18,2011-11-23T17:40:07+00:00,ateixeira,"Jaguar has a sweet heart lease deal on the XF, $599 around me."
19,2011-11-23T22:00:43+00:00,kyfdx,"Looks like the previous generation Equinox/Vue..

At first, I figured it was a Canadian model, but it had local plates...

Rental units only?

Geez... and, I'm the co-Host of the SUV forums.... :surprise:"
20,2011-11-23T22:02:05+00:00,ateixeira,"That was our Saturn Vue. The Captiva name was used in other markets. I'm guessing you saw one from Canada, perhaps?"
21,2011-11-23T22:02:44+00:00,ateixeira,"I keep seeing the same black one, and I've seen a white one once, but this was silver so it was the first time I've seen it. That's 3.

Not exactly common yet."
22,2011-11-23T22:05:29+00:00,kyfdx,Local plates.. I'm wondering if they are still making them for rental fleets? The plate was the same county as the airport...
23,2011-11-23T22:06:40+00:00,fintail,"What's the down payment and MSRP? That might only be average, esp if it is a leftover 2011 without a lot of goodies. I think they base around 50K, and I know I can lease a base E/5/A6 for that money."
24,2011-11-23T22:06:41+00:00,ateixeira,"Interesting...maybe a test vehicle? I think they're still made in some places.

Hmm, not a diplomat's car, else it would have special plates. We get a lot of those around here."
25,2011-11-23T22:09:37+00:00,ateixeira,"Let's see...Equus starts at $58,750, XF starts at $53,000. It was $3 or 4k down, I forget exactly. Similar money down for Hyundai.

So the Jag is 10% cheaper but the lease is 14% cheaper.

So Jag is putting more incentives on that bad boy, because you just know residuals are not a Jag strong point."
26,2011-11-23T22:12:36+00:00,kyfdx,"From Inside Line, last March.. replacing the HHR for fleet customers....

http://www.insideline.com/chevrolet/captiva/2012/with-chevy-hhr-folding-captiva-- will-fill-fleet-gap-in-us.html"
27,2011-11-23T22:14:40+00:00,kyfdx,"GM said in a statement that the Captiva Sport will arrive in the fourth quarter of 2011. It will get either the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine or the 3.0-liter V6 engine matched to a six-speed automatic transmission. It will be offered in LS and LT models, with four trim packages, including an all-wheel-drive model. All versions get 17-inch aluminum wheels, XM Satellite Radio, six-speaker sound system, air-conditioning, four-wheel disc brakes with antilock, traction control and stability control, power locks and windows and remote keyless entry.

Inside Line says: You won't see the Captiva Sport in your driveway, unless the florist or the caterer is making a delivery. &#151; Anita Lienert, Correspondent


I guess this is the 4th quarter... so, there you go.."
28,2011-11-23T22:31:07+00:00,robr2,"The Captiva - kind of like the old Lumina living on for fleet sales for a couple of years as the Chevy Classic and then being replaced by the previous gen Malibu also dubbed the Classic.

It's a nice way of capturing some fleet business, spreading out the cost of tooling and not devaluing a regular model.

Maybe the current Escape could live on as rental only."
29,2011-11-23T23:35:06+00:00,tifighter,"Yeah, I think I read the Captiva is available for fleet purchase only in the US now. Sounds like you have confirmed this."
30,2011-11-23T23:35:43+00:00,fintail,"That assumes both are absolute base models. Ad I saw for the Equus lease was 3K down. Not a huge gap, given the track record for old Jags - for decades they have the resale value of old bread, and for good reason. I wouldn't be beating down any doors for either, really."
31,2011-11-24T01:28:29+00:00,explorerx4,"Probably the second one I have seen on the road.
Amazingly, 2 cars behind it was an XLR, which was also the second one I have ever seen."
32,2011-11-24T18:25:54+00:00,ateixeira,"Actually that would be a good idea. It could protect the new, more stylish Escape, from having to satisfy those fleet customers.

Same for Captiva - the Equinox and Terrain are popular, so this helps keep those out of less profitable fleets, since consumers like 'em."
33,2011-11-26T05:16:19+00:00,lemko,...first new Camry on Rising Sun Avenue near Napfle in NE Philly. This one was sort of a dark gray with a purplish tint.

Really? The first spotting of a Japanese brand model on ""Rising Sun"" Ave."
35,2011-11-26T15:09:56+00:00,ateixeira,"That is ironic.

Saw a silver one on Black Friday.

Also saw a peach colored Smart ForTwo. Mama-mia."

Veloster is almost even with the Accent, at a higher price, and the turbo's not even out yet.

It may not be a home run, but it's a double, at least."

Veloster is easily the most interesting Hyunkia product right now. It's odd looking, but inoffensive, not a copy of others, affordable. Cheap and cheerful."

3,2011-11-30T17:52:25+00:00,ateixeira,"A couple of Civics.

A Juke, with a rear spoiler and all.

S4 - old and new. I kinda prefer the old one. Newer Audis all look the same. They should form the LEDs in to a 4/6/8 just so we can tell them apart."
4,2011-11-30T19:03:29+00:00,boomchek,I'm not a big fan of the new Civics. The proportions are odd and the coupe looks like a triangluar wedge with not many good lines in it.
5,2011-11-30T19:10:07+00:00,ateixeira,"I think Honda perhaps didn't change it enough. It stood still while competitors made big strides.

They will still sell well based on momentum alone."

I see a few Passats on the road as well. They look a bit plain and boring in photos, but have a little bit more presence on the road. Not as stylish as last generation, but then I considered those to be odd looking as well when they first came out.

The new Jetta is a great bang for the buck I think, even though it has the base 2.0L engine dating back over a decade, and a cheap interior.

For those that just need a commuter, it's not a bad entry level car with some style to it. My wife and I were considering leasing a base one, but then we decided that she'll just drive our 07 328i while I play with cheap older commuter cars and avoid montly payments. So far it's working out ok."

Something about childhood memories of gullwing doors that makes me like them a lot. Maybe it's from seeing the C111 in pictures when I was little that made me fall in love with gullwing doors."
44,2011-12-09T19:16:24+00:00,fintail,"The doors do it all. Without them, the SLS wouldn't be so special. It's not really a new 300SL, but it is cool in its own right, and I would take it over a bottom of the line Ferrari or a Audi-Lambo for similar money. The car is also beautifully trimmed and comfortable. Although if you are even tallish, you'll hit your head on the door upon exit - I did."

49,2011-12-10T15:57:07+00:00,andys120,"First encounter with snow for the season usually the toughest one.

How true. There are a number of reasons-

-Early season snows are generally moisture laden, creating very slippery roads.

-People have forgotten how to drive on snow and have to relearn, sometimes the hard way.

-Even those sensible enough to put on winter rubber may not have gotten round to it.

Late season snows are tricky too, those are moisture-loaded too and everybody is sick of driving on tiptoes all winter so they get careless.

Good luck everybody."

I'm not a fan of dark read either.

I do like real red or as my wife calls it ""street walker red"". My old Shelby was that color and I liked that it drew some attention. I'm hoping to get a red like that on my next car.

I like white as well. Silver has become so banal. Dark blues are meh.

I just wish manufacturers brught back some colors to interiors."

Italy Red
Germany White
France Blue
England Green.

The yellow in Ferrari's logo represents Modena, their home city.

Hence, IMHO yellow is the color for Ferrari as the red is terms of racing is not exclusive to them."

White only looks right on a few specific cars. Remember the 4DSC Maximas had that pearl white? That was the ""right"" color for that particular car.

Subaru has a really nice pearl white now, too, for the Outback/Legacy.

WRX must be Rally Blue. Other colors should be ticketed.

BRG for any/all roadsters. Wish Mazda offered it on mine."

95% of the rest of the pics appear to be red.

Most of the first 25 hits on Goggle images are red.

I associate a ""classic"" Mercedes with black. C-Class with white. And you are dead on about BRG. With a tan top/interior in the case of a Miata."

Silver MB is cliched. I am one of those who is tired of silver cars. It seemed new and slick 15 years ago, but is now overplayed.

I'd like a blue Ferrari.

Grey A7 just drove by my window.

I heard the local Lexus dealer has a LFA, so as it is just a few blocks away, I drove by - not there of course. Stopped by the MB dealer to drop off a few things for their toy drive, saw a black C63 coupe with red interior, and a loaded up S63 among some normals."
18,2011-12-20T14:24:25+00:00,ateixeira,"Monochromatic white cars, with the right bumpers, can look great.

More basic cars with black trim stripes look awful in white, so it really depends.

For some reason I like Lincolns and Caddys in black, I guess to offset the chrome.

The Enclave looks good in that brown/copper color.

To me yellow is for Nissan Frontiers with 4x4 stickers and boxy toaster mobiles. Works on certain cars."

Brown has really came back, I have seen a number of mostly lower to middle highline cars in brown lately. Brown W212 didn't look too wrong.

Also avoid using synthetics except for microfiber cloths. My cars have few swirl marks in them."

28,2011-12-21T00:26:34+00:00,andys120,"There is no ""official"" Ferrari color but bright red is the traditional racing color of Italy and since Ferrari has such a strong racing heritage most people think of it as the signature color of Ferrari. The current shade is an fluorescent red-orange called Rosso Corso (Racing Red). In earlier times they used a less orange-y shade that most of us would call Fire-engine red.

Fly Yellow* is a lemon yellow and has been used on many Ferrari racers but not usually by factory teams (Scuderia Ferrari). The team most commonly associated with yellow is the Ecurie Francochamps which was based in Belgium where yellow is the traditional racing color. *(Fly=Ferrari Light Yellow).

Luigi Chinetti's US-based North American Racing Team (NART) raced Ferraris painted white and/or blue, white those being the traditional race colors of the USA."
29,2011-12-21T18:00:38+00:00,boomchek,"Yes, Rosso Corsa is the most popular Ferrari red, although there have been many different variations and shades of red in the past.

31,2011-12-21T21:46:19+00:00,boomchek,I think that's a Grigio Alloy or something similiar. Grigio is grey in Italian and there are quite a few variations of it.

Also saw a new C coupe - silver, and a new A8, which is still looking very sharp and probably a nice alternative to the rapidly aging S-class."

40,2011-12-23T19:45:46+00:00,ateixeira,"This will sound funny but I did *not* see a 5 door Impreza, and I also did *not* see a Kia Rio.

Went to check out VW Eos for my dad at King VW/Kia (he's leaning towards a 200 'vert, though). Saw a black Kia Rio 5 door out front, but it was not available for test drives, as it had already sold. The lot had lots of Sorentos, Optimas, and Souls, but no Rios.

Fitz Subaru is a block away so I stopped to check out a new Impreza. No 5 doors in stock, and the next 5 are pre-sold already. They had one single sedan, a base model, but I would have to wait 1-2 hours in line to test drive it. Huh?

This was a stripped base model, manual trans, basically bare-bones. They added a nice padded dash cover to it, and it definitely looks better in person. For the first time ever, I think the sedan looks better than the 5 door Impreza, though I'd still pick the 5 door. Base model had the cheap plastic wheel covers and the interior lacks a lot of features from the high end model. Price at $18 something, but either step up to a higher end model, or buy used. It's just too bare bones. I wonder if the dealer ordered it as a demo model, knowing it would not sell quickly?

I'll go back when they have a Premium or Limited 5 door, then drive one."

I am out in podunk, of all things to see on the road here yesterday, saw an IS-F - must have been someone passing through or visiting, no Lexus dealer for almost 2 hours in any direction, and there's not really many around who could afford that car anyway.

Also took my cousin's family's new Durango for a little spin, it's actually a pretty nice rig, still a big of a bus, but it drives easy enough, seems very well assembled, and has high quality interior materials. Chryfiat is trying, anyway."

I went with the new Grand Cherokee, which is on the same chassis and also the same as the Mercedes M class. It offers a great button-downed ride and like you said the interior materials are a big notch above the Dodge/Jeep of yore."

Also got two co-workers who picked up new Camrys this week, one XLS and another an SE. One trade was a Buick Lacrosse and the other an older Ford 500."
20,2011-12-30T14:58:04+00:00,ateixeira,In the garage at work. What's with the blue transluscent grille?
21,2011-12-30T18:00:12+00:00,stever,"Do those Nissan vans look a lot bigger in real life than the Transit Connect? From the pics I've seen, they look like they may be as big as Sprinters."
22,2011-12-30T19:38:18+00:00,fintail,"They are closer to a Sprinter than a Transit, for sure. Local dealer always has about 10 laying around."
23,2011-12-30T19:47:10+00:00,boomchek,"The Nissan vans are full sizers, whereas the Transit Connect is like a mid size car with a van box mounted behind the b pillar. I like the Transit Connect euro design though. It works well for small businesses as not everyone needs a full size van that's a pig on gas."
24,2011-12-30T19:47:16+00:00,stever,We need more smaller boxes around here. But I want a Transit Connect with a 5 speed. :shades:

26,2011-12-30T20:31:31+00:00,anythngbutgm,"As others have noted, they are definitely larger than the Transit. They might even be a smidge larger than their domestic (Mexican?) Replacements.

They're certainly not pretty by any means, they are definitely function over form, right down to the squared off haunches instead of the rounded over ones on the others."
27,2011-12-30T21:39:13+00:00,stever,That's more Ford Flexy - the pics I had seen had the tall roof added on. Probably a better highway runner than the Transit Connect.
28,2011-12-31T00:21:44+00:00,fintail,"I saw, of all crazy things, a Fisker Karma in traffic today. It's different."

30,2011-12-31T02:40:35+00:00,fintail,"Driving in Bellevue just a few blocks from where I lived. I even exclaimed the name of the car as it drove by (turning left in front of me as I was at a light) - even though I was alone in the car.

There's also a Tesla dealer in the mall not far from here."
31,2012-01-02T01:13:35+00:00,fintail,"Went out and browsed at a couple lots today, killing time on a nice warm day. Saw a couple Scion iQ - these look much better proportioned than a Smart, but still kind of dopey. One had no price, the other was decked out with bric-a-brac and had an MSRP of about 20K. Seems a little dear. Toyota dealer already had a CPO 12 Camry too.

Also saw a couple Evoque, 4 door models - somehow I don't mind these as they are so rakish (yet insanely impractical), both were loaded up and had MSRP around 55K. No thanks - metal look grille is even plastic. Nothing remarkable at MB, BMW, Lexus, VW, Subaru dealers."
32,2012-01-03T19:10:18+00:00,ateixeira,"still kind of dopey

I pity the person in charge of designing such small cars. Tough work.

CPO 12 Camry

Press fleet? Stay away from those given the abuse they take."
33,2012-01-03T19:11:04+00:00,ateixeira,"C coupe this AM, about the 3rd one I've seen.

Also an appliance-white Prius V."
34,2012-01-03T19:27:04+00:00,fintail,"Luckily for them, those who want tiny cars will think they are cute. 20K though, tough pill to swallow.

This Camry was loaded, had 3K miles on it - they still wanted ~30K for it. Maybe a demo or something.

This morning saw a C coupe as well, a base model Camry, and a dirty black Evoque."
35,2012-01-03T19:32:36+00:00,ateixeira,"20k is insane money for that. Even with an Aston Martin logo.

They priced it higher than the Yaris, but I guess marketing thinks they can still sell them. ForTwo set the bar real low.

Evoque is winning awards left and right, but that's a head-scratcher to me. $44k for a boutique soft roader with a Focus engine?

Then again, it will sell well, just watch."
36,2012-01-03T19:35:35+00:00,fintail,"If the Cygnet was 20K, they'd sell every one and then some. We've devolved even further to a thoughtless status addicted society, and Aston is a darling of ostentatious new money.

44K is also a base Evoque - from what I have seen, good luck finding one. Average MSRP at the local dealer was closer to 55K.

Of course it will sell well - something sportier for the RX crowd who wants to be different."
37,2012-01-03T19:42:37+00:00,ateixeira,"My friend has a Range Rover Sport and they wanted $3 grand for tires and brakes, at just 22k miles. :sick:

I don't think the Evoque's success will be sustainable. First time they realize they have to spend that kind of money to put new tires on those Dubs they'll bail like there's a fire drill at the Land Rover dealer. Resale will drop, and we'll see a death spiral in 2-3 years."
38,2012-01-03T19:52:57+00:00,fintail,"I hope your friend regrets their choice :shades: ...just had to pose, didn't they.

Evoque could end up being little more than a new century Freelander. Resale on Rovers is like day old bread to begin with."

40,2012-01-03T20:14:28+00:00,boomchek,"I think it will be succesful. I don't think it's meant to be an entry level Range Rover but rather a premium small soft roader for those who want the newest with most gadgets, but without the size. At least I think it will be a hit here in the Vancouver area.

Now don't get me wrong, I don't work for Land Rover so I could care less whether it will do well or not, but from working in the ultra luxury car market for the past 6 months I see what clients spend their money on, and many who are very well off will not hesitate blowing this kind of coin on this kind of car. And because of who is buying these cars, I don't see maintenance being an issue either."
41,2012-01-03T20:24:30+00:00,fintail,"The Vancouver market is kind of something in itself, with all of the new resident kinda sketchy new rich.

I do think it will sell to the wifey RX/ML etc kind of market."
42,2012-01-03T20:39:58+00:00,boomchek,"Haha, no doubt.

When working at my previou dealership, we had a client who bought a used Freelander that had nothing but issues. After we sunk money into it to fix some of the things, he still had issues with it.

He came by about 6 months later to get it appraised to get into something else. I took the vehicle for a quick appraisal drive and came back telling him what it was worth. He flipped and stormed out. He got into his Freelander and couldn't start it even though I just drove it 10 minutes earlier. He stormed back in asking me what I did to his Freelander and why it wasn't starting. Last thing I needed was in irate customer stuck here with a car that he thought I broke. Luckily one of the techs played with the ignition for about 10 minutes and got it running again. :lemon:"
43,2012-01-03T20:42:36+00:00,boomchek,"That's exactly who I think will be buying these, wifey kinda car. Add to that the fact that Victoria Beckham had a hand in marketing it (they say she helped ""design"" it, but that's up for interpretation) and you will see many housewives driving these in ritzy neighbourhoods."
44,2012-01-03T21:06:50+00:00,kyfdx,"I think they'll have a hard time moving it... Freelanders sold, because they threw cash at them and got the transaction price down between $26K-$32K (admittedly, this was a few years ago...)

LR2s never sold... even in the mid-high '30s, no one was picking them over X3s....

You can get a pretty well-equipped X3 2.8 for around $45K... a loaded X3 turbo with 300 HP or a maxed out Q5 for $50K... Most Range Rover buyers don't like going down-market for a cheaper model.... and, they've given up completely on the Land Rover crowd...

I predict they will be as common as an Isuzu Axiom or VehiCross... :surprise:"
45,2012-01-03T21:41:47+00:00,ateixeira,"To defend my buddy - at least he really uses the 4WD on sand. He's got an annual pass to the Deleware shore, and actually does get out there regularly.

So not a poseur. I think Land Rover chased him there to get photos for the brochure, though, since he's the only one who uses it as intended!"

I don't know if any real die hard off roader drives a RR Sport - it's kind of a realtor/lawyer/trust funder/kept housewife car, in my eyes. Once they get past the well heeled original owner that boomchek mentions, they also depreciate swiftly (I can get a first year supercharged Sport for under 30K), suggesting they are not easy to maintain."

Down there the Baja Bug was popular. Basically big tires and fender flares, raised clearance.

Couldn't do that today on a FWD platform, though. They could fake it, I suppose."

Also spotted a pair of new CR'V's, one red and one in a carbon gray. This one I think looks better than the outgoing one.

Lastly, a new Impreza hatch in Boston. Sport model."
7,2012-01-09T18:59:44+00:00,fintail,Saw a new-new Beetle today. The lavender color pretty much destroyed VWs stupid aims of pretending the car is somehow more masculine. And I noticed it has a face that reminds me of a dumb dog. Should continue to sell to the same demographic anyway.
8,2012-01-09T19:05:32+00:00,boomchek,I like the new Beetle done in the retro look in black with black looking steelies and metal dog dish hub caps. Less girly than the previous one imo.
9,2012-01-09T19:09:57+00:00,fintail,"Actually, I like those wheels and hubcaps too, odd retro touch for that car. Seemed familiar to me somehow, then I realized what it reminded me of - current Matchbox cars:"

Also spotted a new Camry at the Honda dealer. A V6 Sport model with 8500 miles on it. They wanted $24,500 which was tempting."

Keep your knees bent and always lean downhill. And never ever look down. I always fall when I focus on where I am as opposed to where I want to be."

They installed a new electronic speed trap on Canal Rd, I got 3 warnings in the mail, luckily no fines.

I guess the fines started coming out, and it looks like someone vandalized it. 2 cops were there today fixing something.

Well, guy in a Prius is in front of me, rolls down his windows and reaches his arm out. Instead of a peace sign, BOOM, middle finger! Waves it around, too. Hysterical.

I guess he got a ticket in the mail from them as well, but it was not a warning."

Is that trap located in an area where speeding regularly occurs?
Is it in a location where the higher than the limit speed is actually dangerous?"
2,2012-01-20T14:57:42+00:00,ateixeira,"Yes, average speed is definitely high there. It's almost like a parkway, but they set the limit at an artificially low 35mph. I'd say the 85th percentile is way up around 55 or so.

It's not a residential area, though. It parallels the C&O Canal, and the Potomac River beyond that. Bikes and joggers go on the other side of the canal, so zero pedestrians.

Dangerous? Not at all, IMHO. I've been driving on that road for 19 years and I have not seen a single serious accident, not one.

Local governments lose money on those, too, so it's very controversial here in MD. They make some money at first, then people figure out where to slow down, and then the revenues stop, but the maintenance costs remain.

By rule they usually have to be within a certain distance from a school, but the odd thing is there is no school there. There is a private school up on MacArthur Boulevard ... let me search.

The businesses and industry are long gone. It's safe to go over 35 on that 3 block strip close to the main post office sorting center.

Speed cameras--gotta make that money for the floundering city.

I suggested since the city says they aren't using them to make money, but to improve safety, that they send the money from the ""fines"" to the surrounding 5 counties. The locals will know the cameras are there--the out-of-towners will get caught because they don't know they're coming up. So the fine money should go to those counties for schools funding, e.g."

Also tried to check out the new Impreza but with the snow we got, the dealer was scrambling to move the inventory around for the plowtrucks. But I did check out a Premium hatch. Had the big sport rims, no roof, cloth interior (well done IMO, simple but well built), Auto tranny (36mpg)...

$22,600."

Local MB dealer had a gorgeous CPO E coupe in the showroom, loaded, sable/brown with kind of a tan interior, odd combo and somehow it worked."
15,2012-01-25T01:24:01+00:00,fezo,"Today was a day where I could have had the top down which would have been the second time in January which for NJ isn't bad at all. Unfortunately I got a bit of a bug and napped instead. Dang!

That's a nice collection of cars. One of the reasons for ending up in the Solara is that for a convertible it has a nice trunk. Those folding hard tops tend to have enough room in the truck for a box of tissues.... (The classic for that was the original Miata.... but it's a Miata so who cares?)"

He has an 01 Outback with ridiculously low miles. They kept it since it's been trouble-free. He has a long, hilly driveway so I doubt the Chrysler will make it out if it snows."

That's the car I'd rent if we went to Florida for a week. I wouldn't want to drive it daily even if he gave it to me.

Well, I might leave it at the beach condo, and only use it while I'm there. I'd need a battery tender for the off-season, though."

Not one, not two, but THREE (!) strips or chrome on the bumper itself. One a step/protector, two at the bottom that appear to surround non-functioning exhaust outlets. Actual exhaust smoke was exiting from below the bumper.

Wonder if that's a cheesy dealer add-on or what?"

But oversized wheels are still popular for everything, and IMO older highline cars with blingy aftermarket wheels look trashy. Most of the wheels also come from China, which makes me worry about durability, not a place known for good metallurgy. I suspect in a few years there will be huge amounts of cracked and broken wheels out there."

If your car broke down it could stay on the side of the road for a few days until it could be collected and dealt with.

When I moved to Oregon, I was astonished at what I witnessed.

If you break down here, within 2-3 hours, someone has slashed the tires, busted the windows and stomped on the sheet metal, virtually destroying the car.

WHAT IS WRONG with people here?

:confuse:"
10,2012-02-03T19:02:52+00:00,fintail,"Maybe someone had enemies?

I've never seen it that bad, although they are areas of this region where I wouldn't want to leave my car out for 15 mins, not to mention overnight - and not just for vandalism, but for outright theft.

You buy a Chrysler 300 (a good sedan in its own right), and stick phoney ""B"" (Bently) badges all over the thing.
Who do you think you are fooling?
Its like the poor guy who rents a suit and car for an evening out-the rich guys who see him are laughing their heads off."

the new Escape. Very nice. The Dodge Dart is a quantum leap ahead for Chrysler. and the Sube BRZ? Man, I want one of those some day.

of the other normal cars, the Imprezza was a great package."

Escape sure did look nice. Ford also had a pair of Focus STs. Loved the electric yellow paint ($495 option available on other models) and the seats! New Escape make the old one look 100 years old.

Dart also looked good in person. DC had a cut-away, sort of on its side, did you see that display as well?

BRZ was cool. It was roped off but we talked them in to letting us in. The seats were great, perforated leather steering wheel cover also telescoped. Back seat was useless, though what did I expect? 2 cheap details - the fake fender vents, and the front bumper insert. If it comes in at mid 20s like they say, though, look out, they won't have enough to meet demand.

Impreza was surprisingly roomy - bigger inside than a 3 series or the Lexus CT."

Speaking of E63, I visited the local MB dealer to see if anything weird was hanging around. The assortment was pretty average - all normals with about 5 AMGs thrown in, one a loaded diamond white E63 that had been a demo for the owner of the dealership. It was pretty hot, everything but performance package, they wanted something like 15K off MSRP for it. But, one of the wheels had been scraped, and they didn't fix this before putting it in the showroom. Poor attention to detail.

Also saw an R8 cabrio, a newer (LEDs) GTR, and a new X3 on the road."

It's big too...still has some awkward design ideals, but I certainly wouldn't object to one. The one I saw had metal accents inside which were cool too, a strange textured metal that reminded me of some kind of Japanese art metalwork. Dealer was trying to get me into one too, offered me a $1500 conquest deal coming out of a MB, offered the lease deal, etc.

They also had a LFA on display, apparently you can buy them outright now rather than just be involved in some kind of lease, but buyers must meet ""approval"", which I was told was mostly to prevent grey market activity."

Camrys also.

Another Veloster, still not a turbo. Those should be out?

0,2012-02-21T20:16:50+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Drove a new CR-V and a new Impreza.

First the Impreza. Nice car. Very nice car actually and certainly an upgrade on the inside and outside compared to the outgoing one. This one was a Premium model with cloth and the CVT. Seats were good and the ingress/egress was excellent, especially for rear seat users. Speaking of rear seats, the legroom is as much as my wifes Outback... easily. Regarding the powertrain, the new 2.0 is quiet, smooth and doesn't have much of the Boxer growl. It also feels a bit smoother than my Impreza with the 2.5.

Then there is the CVT. Absolute deal breaker. Wife could not stand the whine and it bugged the crap out of me too. Especially when the radio was on and you could still hear it. I'm sorry but 36mpg is incredible but I would rather give up a couple of MPG's for a conventional automatic (heck even the current 4-speed) or I would go with the stick all the way (33mpg). Sticker price for a loaded Sport Limited was just over 25 grand which is a great price for AWD, BT, heated seats, Nav, moonroof and foglights. But this car was for my wife and the CVT killed it for us.

Next, the CR-V. Sticker price was just over 30 for an EX-L with Nav. My wife loved the step in ingress and the seats were better than the ones in her LL Bean OB. I owned a 2000 CR-V which I loved but my gosh this new one is like night and day. The engine, the acceleration, the road noise were all exceptional for this class. Even the visibility, which I was expecting to be poor was just fine for seeing out the back. I especially liked the amount of windsheild there was, it reminded me of the old Hondas in the visibility/airy cabin dept. Powertrain-wise, again, the acceleration was good and the engine was very quiet. Now, I pretty much haven't met an automatic that I actually liked, but the one in the CR-V was downright perfect. There was no gear hunting, there was no droning and the changes were timed exactly when I wanted them. I could live with the Automatic on the V. Oh, and the test drive consisted of a couple of not-so-great roads and the thing soaked up the bumps great.

Basically, there was not one thing about it that I was disappointed with.

Except.

No Homelink... :sick:

Seriously, what a stupid ommision. out of all the electronics on my wife's Outback that get used the most, I'll bet homelink takes second only to the Stereo. I have a 2 car garage and it is just plain assinine to think that I am going to carry around a keychain with (2) transmitters or I'm going to have (2) different ""clickers"" hanging from the visor. :mad:

Oh sure, Honda will install one of those Gentex rear view mirrors with Homelink but it'll probably be another 500 bucks and they'll have to take apart the interior to do so which could introduce rattles. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

Anyways, other than that, it looks like the CR-V will be at the top of the list for my wifes next vehicle. But, hopefully by the time she's ready, Honda will add this feature to an already excellent array of gadgets. And if there are people out there who don't mind the ommission, I highly recommend a test drive."
1,2012-02-21T21:36:29+00:00,ateixeira,"Teach her to drive stick! :shades:

CVT may be seen as a necessary harm with upcoming CAFE regs. Subaru has the AWD handicap across the board (BRZ excepted), so that makes meeting CAFE numbers even harder.

You can still get a Forester or H6 Outback with a conventional automatic."
2,2012-02-21T22:12:56+00:00,fintail,"Funny, that car has appeared in the show before:



If you've watched the not as good as the movie animated ""Napoleon Dynamite"" series, the grandmother character drives a bustleback Seville which is often rendered well for such a show:



Today's new sighting, Impreza, seeing them off and on now."
3,2012-02-22T04:10:02+00:00,berri,I think CVT may be one of the dumbest innovations in cars. I don't see one advantage. They don't drive as well and the mileage seems worse. Every Altima I've rented gets several less mpg than others like Camry.
4,2012-02-22T16:19:46+00:00,ateixeira,"In theory, a CVT can put an engine at an ideal RPM and keep it there. Peak torque, for instance, or peak HP.

It's all in the tuning. They can even simulate gears.

People tend to love 'em or hate 'em, though. In the Subaru threads that's how it is, love/hate.

I will say that MPG reports have skyrocketed for all the models that got CVTs (base Legacy/Outback and Impreza).

Thankfully you can still get a manual in the Impreza, Forester, and Outback. I can't imagine craving a traditional slush box, no matter the car."

I also lost track of how many new CR-V's I saw. But definitely the most common vehicle on my trip had to be the Honda Pilot. All different years. They are as common as Subarus and BMW's.

Couple of one off sightings, a Panamera, a new Toureg, a new Durango (a rarity around here), a new CLS, and even a new 3-series."

So, I have been showing her pics of the newer stuff coming out (Escape, CX-5, etc. since we are looking for a small/mid size CUV).

I also had the program fromt he Philly car show (she was sick and could not go with me).

after looking at the book, and some stuff I showed her online, the ""normal"" one she liked the best? The Hyundai Santa Fe (current style, not even the one coming out later in the year).

She also does not want to go too small, and I think something like the CX-5 won't be big enough for her. But, the Hyundai seems to hit that sweet spot of a big small one, or a small big one."

I can't think of another place to mention it, but I also saw an old SVT Contour as well. Almost forgot about those, man I wanted one badly when they were out.

This one looked a little rough, the passenger side rocker was missing and the whole edge was rusted plus there was rust around the rear quarters, But I rolled my window down while he went by and the engine purred like new. Oh and it was actually green! That's got to be a rarity in of itself. :surprise:"

They were nicely equipped (very euro) at the beginning, but they pulled a toyota and made them cheaper every year is seems. Worlds different from the '98(or '99?) 4 cyl AT my son had for a while."
17,2012-03-01T03:25:55+00:00,jwilliams2,"Was the dealers ""as is - no warranty"" Federally mandated sticker on the window? If so, it could just mean the dealer doesn't warranty it, because it's still under the manufactures warranty."

To me, it implies no manufacturers warranty either."

Also saw another new CR-V. Seems like I see them often now.

Finally, a Chevy Volt was behind me early today."

MB dealer had nothing really exciting but a salesman said he wanted to buy my car when I was ready to sell. Saw a new style 3er - loaded sport 335i sedan, 57K sticker - same dealer had a zillion leftover 11 3ers. Audi dealer had nothing unusual but I will say the A6 is lovely inside, weird overbite on the trunk though. Saw a Lexus LX570 with a 92K sticker and they also still had a good 10 or more new GS. Subaru only had a couple new Imprezas and nothing else noteworthy, VW had many new Beetles and Jettas but the most interesting car on the lot was an old SLC. Toyota had many new Camry and Yaris, a few Scion iQ too, one with a 20K+ sticker.

MB dealer said the B should be here by the end of the year and the A is definitely coming, will be interesting to see new niches chased in the US."
30,2012-03-05T01:56:18+00:00,stever,"Looked bigger in the Outback parking lot than it did at the auto show last year. Still had the temporary tags on it. Looks like a real car, compared to a Smart.

Saw a few hundred brand new VWs today but was too far away to tell if they were all Passats or not."
31,2012-03-05T02:20:41+00:00,explorerx4,"Did you drive by the factory?
I see lots of Cruze's every time I drive through Lordstown."
32,2012-03-05T02:34:36+00:00,stever,"Yeah, there's a new nature park out there adjacent to the factory so we went for a three mile walk this morning. Lots of the new cars are under ""shade"" islands - keeps the bird and hail mess off them I guess. Maybe we'll be able to get on a factory tour one trip south.

Passed about 3 car carriers on the Interstate the last couple of days full of Mazdas and Chevys. SAAR hit a huge 15.1 million for February so there should be lots of new rides to see. Heading to Florida in the morning so I'll keep my eyes peeled for new Caddys and Buicks. :shades:"
33,2012-03-05T11:22:28+00:00,qbrozen,Evoque and Sonic hatch. Both black. I didn't spot whether the evoque was 2 or 4-door as it didn't click with me (since i was focused on getting somewhere quickly) until the sideview was out of sight.
34,2012-03-05T15:00:51+00:00,ateixeira,"Still rare, I've only seen a couple of these on the road. Top was up, since it's cold, though I'm not sure it would look any better with the top down.

Also saw an H3 and an H2 this AM, not new, but I don't see either nearly as often as before. I guess most have moved away from urban use to rural areas? Who knows."
35,2012-03-05T18:15:12+00:00,fintail,"Saw the silver Karma from the car lot the other day out on the road. Being driven by a high level dealer person I am sure.

Also saw a truckload of new cars - all Imprezas and various Nissans. Maybe the factories are close?

Oh, funny thing from yesterday at the MB dealer - after having a salesman want to buy my car, I went to the used section and was approached/ambushed by a saleswoman. I told her I was just looking to see if anything new and weird was on the lot, and she asked several times about what I would want to buy if they had it. I told her the specific color combination high option bluetec that likely doesn't exist. I think that scared her off :shades:"
36,2012-03-05T18:21:31+00:00,ateixeira,"All Imprezas are made in Gunma, Japan. Maybe you're close to the port? Or some storage facility?

They should kick Toyota out of SIA and put a Forester/Impreza assembly line in its place.

PS I use that tactic, i.e. asking for something I know they won't have. In my case it usually involves a manual transmission."
37,2012-03-05T18:31:59+00:00,fintail,"Oh, I thought they were USA made now. Must be a storage issue then, as I am pretty sure the local dealers are unrelated.

My imagined bluetec - quartz blue with light (almond or beige) interior, P2, pano, sport - I really doubt it exists, would have to be a special order. I'd even choose a wagon if we had a diesel here."
38,2012-03-05T18:36:06+00:00,ateixeira,And I want any diesel wagon with a manual but that ain't happening either.

I think Mazdas come in there, too... Remember the ship that rolled over? Didn't those cars all come in up that way... then, straight to the salvage yard?"
42,2012-03-05T20:53:35+00:00,ateixeira,"Cougar Ace IIRC?

Yeah, Mazda crushed them all to prevent sub-standard parts from making it to to the gray market.

Think about how many Miatas died."

One of the man reasons I would never live some place where I had to street park. I don't even like to leave my car in my driveway in a quiet suburban 'hood. And I am amazed at how many people with 2 gar garages can't even get 1 car in them!

31,2012-03-14T18:33:22+00:00,lemko,Spotted a purple-ish blue Mazda 5 with aftermarket plastic eyelashes over the headlights! STRANGE!!! :surprise:
32,2012-03-14T18:36:20+00:00,ateixeira,I saw some lashes like that on an orange Kia in a Target parking lot. We took photos and shared on FaceBook. It got a lot of laughs!
33,2012-03-14T20:03:47+00:00,fintail,"I see stuff like that in my area quite often. A certain demographic thinks it is cute. I see it as embarrassing a car, like putting goofy clothes on a pet."

35,2012-03-15T02:15:40+00:00,stickguy,"saw one at my office that must have been on a test drive. Still had the window sticker,various decals, plastic on the seats, etc. Just like it came off the truck. No idea why someone had one like that at work."
36,2012-03-15T14:22:47+00:00,ateixeira,"First new style 3 series I've seen in the wild. Still not a fan of the headlights, but other angles look OK.

Also another CR-V, very common around here."

42,2012-03-17T21:46:01+00:00,stickguy,"Not sure which hot-rod 911 it was (GT2 or GT3), but a newish version of one of them.

interesting part, it was on a trailer with a tire rack, so looked to be some sort of race car (maybe auto-X?) Not full on race stuff, but must have been more than just a road car.

real interesting part? The tow vehicle was another Porsche, a Cayenne. Expensive tow truck there."
43,2012-03-18T11:11:25+00:00,tjc78,New Gallardo in lime green at a major shopping area. I sure hope he wasnt parking that thing anywhere in that madness.
44,2012-03-18T22:13:50+00:00,robr2,Saw the first Taurus cruiser today. Very interesting since the Boston Globe auto section today had a story about the new Explorers the State Police just put into service. They ordered 140 of them to go on-line in the next year.
45,2012-03-19T12:44:57+00:00,anythngbutgm,"In a row, new E-class coupe, 911 GT2, Range Rover Evoque, Porsche Panamera, Lamborghini Murcialago convertible (ragtop on = fugly). Also a slew of new CR-V's parked on Newbury along with a new 328i.

Just walking down Newbury, I was passed by an Audi RS4, new Cayenne Turbo and an incredible SLS convertible... 6.3 AMG and all :surprise:

Then there was a ""tuned"" Sti than took off like a bullet on Mass Ave. damn...

Wynton Marsalis at the BSH btw, if he comes to your area, definitely go see him. Phenominal performance."
46,2012-03-19T13:09:27+00:00,qbrozen,"I think that's the same one I have autocrossed with (was the 911 white?). I mean, really, how many Cayennes towing 911s can there be? It is a GT3, BTW. Very very fast car that gets beat to hell by the owner and his codriver, who also happens to be the organizer of the Northern NJ SCCA events. One of them is typically in the top 3 times of the day. Amazing to me that someone can afford to trash such an expensive car."
47,2012-03-19T18:34:47+00:00,ateixeira,"Must've been an embassy car, as I'm not far from there, but I saw a Corolla Verso tall wagon type of thing. At first I thought it was a Prius V, it's tall like that, taller even.

Only one I've ever seen in the flesh."
48,2012-03-19T19:16:55+00:00,fintail,"Not new, but I saw 2 Regals today, only one was a rental. Another decent enough car that was a failure to launch."
49,2012-03-19T19:34:47+00:00,ateixeira,"Is it just being sold in the wrong store?

Seriously, even with a good product, are young GM buyers who want a sport sedan even choosing a Buick dealer? Sure some recall the GNX but that was in the 80s, over 25 years ago.

Look at the steep discounts they are offering. It's like Buick is competing with Chevrolet, just smaller and sportier, but no one knows it."
0,2012-03-19T19:43:07+00:00,fintail,"That's probably a big part of it. Buick isn't completely reinvented yet - and I think the MSRP is inflated in typical GM style, compared to attainable transaction prices. That has to turn off more than a few,

I've seen Regal CXL down not much over 20K in screamer ads, not terrible for that."
1,2012-03-19T19:46:13+00:00,ateixeira,"Regal is a bargain if your alternative is a TSX or something like that.

It would have made more sense with the Pontiac name, though I get that they kept Buick for China. This is just a bad side effect of that decision."
2,2012-03-19T19:48:40+00:00,fintail,"Yeah. It's maybe half a size too small for a Camcord competitor, but it's still some bang for the buck. Unfortunately, the base DI unit can be kind of coarse, and isn't a screamer - but it gets decent mileage from my experience (had one as a rental).

With no Pontiac, tough decision as to where it should live. Maybe should have been a Malibu."
3,2012-03-19T19:53:05+00:00,tjc78,"Just imagine if the regal was born a Pontiac. It would have some form of huge plastic body cladding, orange and red interior lighting and who knows what the front end would look like.

To your point there aren't many cars it competes with. It is a tweener in terms of size (not quite midsize, but not compact either). The only direct competitor really is the TSX and I guess you could throw in the Volvo S60."
4,2012-03-19T19:58:48+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, slightly smaller, lighter, and sportier than the Camry/Malibu etc.

The previous Mazda6s and Legacy GT could be put in the same class, but the new ones bloated up and got bigger.

Who else? Maybe the Kizashi if VW and GM had not starved them of a decent engine.

Fact is, these are better suited for Europe, where the narrow bodies are preferred over the fat cats we get here, most of which are full-sizers now."
5,2012-03-19T20:16:55+00:00,fintail,"In Germany, it more or less is the Malibu equivalent. Maybe just not a good idea to bring it here, where local custom dictates something wider and blander for the mass market."
6,2012-03-19T20:21:11+00:00,ateixeira,"And then they sell it next to the Lucerne, because we all go car shopping with our grandparents, right?"
7,2012-03-19T21:02:46+00:00,stickguy,"yeah, the GT3 was white. The Cayanne was silver/gray. Heading south on 295 (so south of you and heading souther)

and heck, for the money they cahrge to make it into a ""race car"", it better be able to put up with some hard use!"
8,2012-03-19T21:38:19+00:00,fintail,"And then barely market it, delay the performance model, don't offer it at half the spec of Europe, and fail to bring in the wagon."
9,2012-03-19T23:36:23+00:00,stever,"In Detroit rush hour traffic, blowing by in the left lane (did catch up with him ~3 times).

Not new, but also saw a very secure undershirt wearing guy, smoking with the window down, driving an older Thunderbird that was brilliant pink."

16,2012-03-20T19:04:42+00:00,tjc78,"Saw two Equus today within minutes of each other. That makes for a total of 3 since they came out.

Also saw a brand new Porsche Cayenne. I looked it up, they redesigned last year but this was the first ""new"" body style I've seen."
17,2012-03-20T20:40:14+00:00,fintail,"Must have been some Hyundai dealers out for a demo run or something :shades: ...60K+ seems steep for a mountain of KDM style with how the big boys depreciate, but I guess there's a butt for every seat.

I wish I could say I have only seen one new Cayenne - in my area with too much idle money milling around, they seem to sell well. No uglier than the old one, anyway."
18,2012-03-20T22:56:33+00:00,fushigi,"From the ""Comparisons and Conclusions"" section of Edmund's Equus wrap-up: http://www.insideline.com/hyundai/equus/2011/2011-hyundai-equus-long-term-test-w- rap-up.html:

Most significant of all comparison points between these vehicles was resale value. Based on a private-party sale, Edmunds' TMV® Calculator showed that the Equus depreciated just 17 percent from its original MSRP. Under similar conditions the 528i and M56 depreciated 22 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Hyundai products have not traditionally fared well in the resale realm. So this is a big step in the right direction.

Personally, I wouldn't buy one. If I had $60K to spend on a car I wouldn't; I'd much rather spend $30-35K and have lots of change left over. I'm simply not in the target demographics. But for what it is - luxury at a value price - the Equus is not a bad deal."
19,2012-03-21T00:35:21+00:00,stickguy,"my opinion in general is that you hit the law of diminishing returns pretty quickly. you get to a certain point, and the huge increase in $$ gets very little real value back."
20,2012-03-21T00:54:31+00:00,fintail,"How many of these exist to determine real world resale value? I'd love to know the details of that sale, but I bet they don't exist. I am a little skeptical. Of course, it doesn't really compete with the much smaller 5er and M anyway. Cars compete in more than price. This thing is trying to compete with the LS especially, then the Germans and probably Jag too.

Locally there's a ~25K mile 08 S63 P3 special order nearly full option load car (original MSRP 145K) that I could pick up, add an extended warranty, and still come out the same as a deluxe Equus. That's how I would do it anyway, same money, similar lux, nicer to look at and better to drive. Alas, I can't blow 65K on a car either way :shades:

Oh yeah, saw a new small Prius today. If I wanted to go that route, I think I'd choose that one."
21,2012-03-21T15:38:24+00:00,ateixeira,"Isn't the S63 a SWB model?

I think a driver would buy the AMG, while the Equus would be more chauffer driven.

To me the Genesis is more appealing vs its big brother. For mid 30s you can get 333hp, 29mpg highway, 8 speed automatic, and the real leather dash package.

So basically a nice, big RWD car for the price of a base C class, with a powertrain that will be under warranty in the year 2022."
22,2012-03-21T15:39:39+00:00,ateixeira,"3 wheeler, last night.

This morning I saw a ZDX and a Camry.

Of those 3 I'd take the Can Am! :shades:"
23,2012-03-21T15:47:01+00:00,fintail,"Only SWB W221 in NA have been the diesel and the hybrid. A regular S550 which is something more comparable - not tuned, would be a bit cheaper yet for the same model year, could get one still under factory warranty for the same money. Just can't see how the pseudo LS Equus has appeal, unless you are a rabid Korean expat.

I agree the Genesis is a much better value, so much so that I have my doubts it is even being sold at a profit - just too much for the money."
24,2012-03-21T15:47:33+00:00,fintail,I picture the same person who would buy a ZDX as buying a Can Am
25,2012-03-21T15:49:24+00:00,texases,To me the Can Am combines the weaknesses of a motorcycle (exposed to the weather and no crash protection) with none of the benefits (carving down a canyon road). I'll pass.
26,2012-03-21T15:51:25+00:00,ateixeira,"Didn't realize that about the wheelbase lengths, I guess we learn something each day.

I wonder if those Equus are bought up by the limo companies? I would not be surprised if half of them are for that type of fleet, and those customers want new, not used.

so much so that I have my doubts it is even being sold at a profit

Agreed. For mid 30s is doesn't raise any eyebrows, either. That's loaded mainstream sedan money."
27,2012-03-21T17:34:14+00:00,fintail,"I believe there is a SWB S63 available elsewhere.

For the Equus, how many are really being bought at all? I wouldn't doubt some are selling commercially, I wonder about the transaction price in those cases too...probably not 65K.

Original Lexus LS was no doubt sold at a loss here to get things going, I think the Genesis is the same. Awaiting the Kia version."
28,2012-03-21T17:35:27+00:00,fintail,"I think they just have kind of an awkward looking riding position. Expensive, too."
29,2012-03-21T17:45:01+00:00,ateixeira,"Not many ... 284 in Feb, 292 in Jan."
30,2012-03-21T18:09:05+00:00,fintail,Probably 90% sold to dealers or Korean embassies :shades:
31,2012-03-21T18:35:46+00:00,ateixeira,"The other 10% to wealthy Korean businessmen.

Tell you what, though, it's pretty nice inside those things. I wouldn't mind being driven around in one of those bad boys. I think the ceiling is lined with suede..."
32,2012-03-21T19:34:38+00:00,kyfdx,"On the plus side: If you ride wearing khakis and topsiders, you'll fit right in.... :surprise:"
33,2012-03-22T01:28:50+00:00,fintail,"That's pretty much the demographic. A sportbike for the Goldwing set, I guess. I think I have only seen two of them on the road.

Saw two new freshly plated Mazdas today, a 3 and a 5 with the ridiculous side detailing. Both rentals.

Not new, but also saw the SL65 AMG I saw the other day, sounded amazing."
34,2012-03-22T16:18:03+00:00,ateixeira,"ridiculous side detailing

Unfortunately that's the trend now, and not just for Asian brands."
35,2012-03-22T17:04:49+00:00,fintail,"But look at that overdone upper detail:



Dopey, embarrassing - who do they think they are kidding, a diagonal swoopy line doesn't make a shoebox a race car. Reminds me of the accent painting on modern RVs. And that with the gormless smiling face...maybe if I was a 15 year old girl who lives in Japan...

Sadly, the copycat sycophant ranks of car designers will probably spread this everywhere."
36,2012-03-22T17:20:23+00:00,ateixeira,"Funny thing is that's the last Mazda that used the old design language, since discontinued.

The new B-class added ""surface excitement"" as well. The old model was clean and cute, now it's busy looking in profile.

To be fair, I do think it lowers the tall wagon visually, at least."
37,2012-03-22T17:52:22+00:00,fintail,"As long as you can still buy a new one, that's current enough for me. Nice to see they finally realized their mistake. I don't know if the B-class has that weird feathery detailing, and thankfully will also lack the dumb face. I see it as faux interest, making something boring look complex."
38,2012-03-22T18:02:40+00:00,ateixeira,"I guess (?) it's supposed to make you look lower down, so the car doesn't appear so tall and awkward (which it is).

I liked the last one more - it was the only minivan you could get with a manual and factory Navi. We deemed it too small, and ended up with the Sienna. No regrets.

Nagare was a bad phase for Mazda, fortunately a short one."
39,2012-03-22T18:18:37+00:00,fintail,"That might be it, it's a distraction. Kind of like a bad crash - you can't help but look...look at the weird details, ignore the overall boredom.

Not even the dorky anime generation embraced those faces. There's a fine line."
40,2012-03-22T18:27:57+00:00,stickguy,"when I was looking at the CX-5, they had one parked right next to a CX-7. Much different looking ""face"" on the new model.

The nagare style always reminded me of this (especially on the 3):"
41,2012-03-22T19:07:38+00:00,ateixeira,"Mazda tried too hard to create a family resemblance. I looked for a left over 2008 MX-5 rather than get a smiley face 2009.

The CX5 will be successful. It's the most efficient in a segment that is hot, and MPG is big right now. Today they just announced it's an IIHS Top Safety Pick and I doubt that will hurt.

I bet it outsells the CX7 2-to-1."
42,2012-03-22T20:30:11+00:00,fintail,"Hah, that's a good one...maybe a Mazda stylist took inspiration here"
43,2012-03-23T12:28:50+00:00,anythngbutgm,"A Toyota dealer last night to see if they had any FR-S but they did not.

On the other hand, they had 6 Prius C's and every single one of them had a ""Sold"" or ""On Hold"" tag.

Only one of them had a ton of options checked and rang up at $24,625... Not a bad looking little car once you add the alloys."
44,2012-03-23T14:54:39+00:00,ateixeira,"That's a bit spendy ... buyers would be wise to do a little math. You can get a nice Fit or Fiesta for high teens. You can buy a lot of gas for that difference.

Fitzmall has 6-7 of them and they were $21-22k , which actually makes sense. You save about $6-800 per year per EPA's web site, so you'll actually make it up by the time you pay off your loan."
45,2012-03-23T15:17:53+00:00,fintail,"Friend of mine who wants to replaced a miled up Accord test drove a Prius C yesterday. He liked it. At his local dealer (ATL suburbs) it was the same story, all but one was loaded and with ~24K stickers. Looks better than the dorky normal Prius and the big one, anyway."
46,2012-03-23T15:40:58+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a pearl white one with the new gunmetal color option on the wheels - best looking color combo I've seen on the new one. Thumbs up.

Also saw a plain silver one and it didn't look nearly as good.

Another Camry, and 2 Prius Vs."
47,2012-03-23T16:23:16+00:00,qbrozen,"I'm confused by their marketing campaign for that car. seems to me they are saying you have to be a dork to buy one. :confuse:

I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with that sentiment, I just don't get why they'd want to market it that way."
48,2012-03-23T16:27:38+00:00,stever,"You can buy a lot of gas for that difference.

IHS Global Insight says gas could hit $8 a gallon by the first of next year. Alarmist but the pundit isn't an idiot either. (USA Today).

We may have to expand this discussion's title to ""I spotted a NEW (insert make/model/bicycle/skateboard/city bus/ZipCar/golf car/electric scooter) today!"""
49,2012-03-23T16:31:59+00:00,texases,"That's a big 'what if' scenario. Certainly possible, but there's a difference between than and what will happen. Same kinds of predictions were made the last time gas made a runup. Also possible - drop in demand and/or reduction in tensions cause a price drop.

2,2012-03-23T16:58:31+00:00,stever,"The stories will sure help sell a lot of Prii. Even some Volts.

Thought I saw a Smart car on the last leg home yesterday, but noted as it passed that it was another iQ.

Not long after that my wife had to brake hard to avoid three deer running across the road at midday. Two more were loitering on the shoulder ten minutes later. Even the minivan isn't big enough for smashing into one of those."
3,2012-03-23T17:01:17+00:00,ateixeira,"We tend to reach equilibrium one way or another. The market corrects itself - gas jumps up, the economy slows, people drive less.

We haven't seen cheap gas in so long that many are putting a higher priority on MPG. Greedy oil barons may not have their cake and eat it this time."
4,2012-03-23T17:09:46+00:00,stickguy,"well, I can say that MPG is a big consideration as my wife and I look for the next vehicle to replace the minivan. Within reason, that is.

If I really was concerned, we would be going even smaller to eke out better MPG (a mazda 3 hatch, maybe a Jetta wagon, or something small car like).

So we are still shopping in a class that overall does not get as good mileage (compact/midsize CUV), but within the class, there is a pretty big spread.

Right now, the mazda CX-5 is looking good. My wife also wants to scope out a CR-V. But something like a Highlander is out (too big and trucky anyway). As is the Pilot.

at year end when I get a car for myself that will likely come into play also, but not as much (since I likely will be buying used, and don't put on many miles)."
5,2012-03-23T17:15:48+00:00,ateixeira,"I like the CX5, too.

Wifey has a Forester, it's a good ""medium"", i.e. right-sized. Not too big, but not too small. The CX5 is close in size, so it should serve well all around.

The Sienna is huge, but we've used every bit of space it has. Plus I don't have to drive it in the city. Around here it feels big and clumsy, but out on the highway it's great - a smooth and comfy way to eat up the miles on long trips.

My MX-5 is definitely small. It's my daily/commuter.

I'm not sure which car I'll replace next. To be honest I'm happy with all of them. I'd like a more tolerant ride (the Miata has the big rims and sport suspension), but every time I think about trading I get a nice sunny day and that desire goes away.

We have had a GREAT spring for convertibles.

Back to NEW cars, I'd love to see a SkyActiv Miata. :shades:"
6,2012-03-26T00:10:48+00:00,fintail,"Local Lexus dealer still has a good 8-10 or more new GS on the lot - either there are no more ""supply issues"" to fall back on to defend weak sales, or these things aren't selling. Maybe customers are holding off until the newness declines and prices become negotiable.

Also saw a couple C coupes, a few new Camrys, and a Leaf that was filthy with a couple scrapes and a hood that apparently didn't latch correctly."
7,2012-03-26T14:30:05+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a GS on the road today.

February sales were up 587% for the model. Not bad...

Feb 2011 was pre-tsunami, too. For the next few months we should see huge gains across the board for Lexus."
8,2012-03-26T16:23:45+00:00,anythngbutgm,Two of them over the weekend. I can see them selling well if the price of gas keeps going up this summer. For a basic city car for a single individual it's perfect. Gotta wonder what is going to happen to Smart sales tho...
9,2012-03-26T17:24:26+00:00,fintail,"I haven't seen one driving yet, which is surprising as I live close to the dealer. What did they sell in Feb 11 - 20 units? The gain has to be massive...I'd have to question anyone who bought the old one at the end of the run, as it was so terribly outclassed and invisible compared to virtually every competitor.

Saw a trunkback Sonic today that wasn't a rental."
10,2012-03-26T17:38:34+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, 11 sales are 1000% more than 1 sale, right?

GS seems to be building share, though, which is something its predecessor never did.

They won't exceed the class leaders but at least they would show up in a pie chart now."
11,2012-03-26T17:41:19+00:00,fintail,"I think the old one lost massively with each new year after the updated style, so there is only one way to go - up. The new one looks competitive - so it should put up a fight, especially if it can undercut just a little price-wise. Maybe there will be some good end year lease deals."
12,2012-03-26T18:06:17+00:00,ateixeira,"Quick searches for press releases, let's see, the first February for the last model was 2006 and they sold 2049, and that includes hybrids+V6+V8. By 2007 it had cooled to 1563 sales, and by 2011 just 349. Ouch!

New one sold 2396 with just a V6 model. So it already beat the record for the last one by 20% with no hybrid out yet.

They will have to sustain those sales, though, with constant improvements, and maybe new model intros (hybrid, V8?).

A good start, though."
13,2012-03-26T18:21:08+00:00,fintail,"I'd like to talk to those 349 people. Family of dealers or dealers themselves maybe? Seems fishy. I can't imagine a normal consumer who would want to go that way.

Hybrid is coming, but I bet there's a good chance there will be no V8."
14,2012-03-26T18:38:26+00:00,tjc78,"I'd like to talk to those 349 people.

Some people have no idea of upcoming models. They walk into the dealership and buy what they see.

The previous gen GS might not have been a class leader, or heck even relevant compared to the competition, but to most people it still was/is a really nice car."
15,2012-03-26T18:38:31+00:00,ateixeira,"I think once the new IS arrives, they should put a V8 in the GS. Even if it's a low volume GS-F.

If you look at the volume models in the segment, they offer multiple engine options and even wagon body styles. GS can only do so much with a pair of sedans."
16,2012-03-26T18:47:21+00:00,fintail,"GS-F wouldn't have to just be a V8, but a completely tuned car - or it will be laughed at by the E63/M5/S-RS6. Might not be where Lexus wants to go, and I think the market is slowly moving away from V8s in those cars anyway - V8 cars in the competition are less and less common over time. W212 E550 and 550i are seldom seen, where in the past V8 E and 5 were much more common.

The competition does have more styles, something Lexus hasn't traditionally done for any model. That won't be happening. GS will likely be just the 6 and the hybrid - if a V8 does come around I'd wager it is no more than 5% of sales."
17,2012-03-26T18:48:45+00:00,fintail,"I guess non-car people buy cars too. I could see my mother buying one if she had that kind of cash.

349 sounds more like a yearly sales total for the end of that line. It just got overwhelmed, where even when new it didn't exceed."
18,2012-03-26T18:51:09+00:00,ateixeira,"It becomes a tough call, near-lux customers seem to be accepting turbo 4s, would a blown V6 make more sense, perhaps?"
19,2012-03-26T18:57:11+00:00,fintail,"A lot can be done with a 6, and there's not a lot of need for a V8 these days anyway (my next car probably won't be one)...they could make a ""super"" 6, but if they go the F route with that, they better be careful, as it will be compared to other tuned cars, and won't match up.

I don't see Lexus even doing that though. The new GS is a fine car and will sell well, competition won't be redone for several years yet, so it won't be quite as tight as the previous model."
20,2012-03-26T19:07:09+00:00,ateixeira,"I think they need to avoid what happened to Acura - no V8 flagship meant a sinking image.

They have the LS, though. Plus they try to pitch the hybrid as more than a V6, but a lot of people (myself included) have trouble seeing it that way, since it's heavy.

To date hybrid+economy has worked, hybrid+performance has not worked. I'm not convinced the GS will change that trend."
21,2012-03-26T19:21:05+00:00,fintail,"Is the updated high tech RL even made anymore? I've seen used ones for like 15K. It vanished.

Yeah, their hybrid is in a tough position, like it is for the white elephant LS600h. Minor performance improvement, negligible mileage gain, significant price jump. I don't think most will run for it. So far for GS stats I have seen something like 10% or so mileage gain, but similar price gain, and I doubt any better performance."
22,2012-03-26T20:12:59+00:00,ateixeira,"Used RLs sell for roughly the same as used TLs. That's not OK.

Infiniti shook up the segment with the M hybrid, so Lexus had to respond if only to defend its turf.

We'll see how it shakes out, but to me ""hybrid luxury"" is still an oxymoron."
23,2012-03-26T20:16:38+00:00,texases,"""Infiniti shook up the segment with the M hybrid""

I thought the LS600h came first."
24,2012-03-26T20:16:43+00:00,fintail,"RL is a used bargain though, can get one that looks almost new for the price of a nicely equipped Rio. Should be dead reliable if not a bit bland. Bang for the buck.

I wonder what the take rate is on the M hybrid, even 10%? The old GS had a (non selling) hybrid variant too, so it's nothing new for them.

Hybrid luxury has to offer more than 1 extra mpg or .1 less 0-60 for less than 10K."
25,2012-03-26T20:22:50+00:00,ateixeira,"The M was the first to make a legitimate attempt at being sporty, though. I believe it's significantly quicker than the M37 V6 model.

Usually the hybrid uses some fuel sipper Atkinson cycle version of the donor engine, de-tuned to get good MPG."
26,2012-03-26T20:25:11+00:00,ateixeira,"A pre-beak RL is a bargain, plus the Nav was pretty nice for its day and age (2005 IIRC?), one of the early systems with traffic data."
27,2012-03-26T20:40:10+00:00,fintail,"Correct on both counts. If I was used car shopping right now, I'd definitely take one for a drive. 300hp with AWD, looks that aren't exciting but have aged well, tech that isn't obsolete, high build quality and reliability, priced in the mid teens - this is why I don't like new cars."
28,2012-03-26T20:49:05+00:00,ateixeira,"2005 w/84k miles for $16k, with SH-AWD.

That was a $50k car new. For less than 1/3rd the price of new, and it's got tons of life left in it.

I looked at these in '09 when my wife was shopping. She wanted a new car and you know what they say, happy wife happy life.

At least she picked a new car with very strong residual value."

30,2012-03-26T20:54:31+00:00,ateixeira,"That's asking price on a quick search. I'm sure you could do better.

Funny thing is back in 2009 they didn't cost a lot more than that - some were already under $20k."
31,2012-03-26T20:56:18+00:00,fintail,"Depreciation floor for the new style - slow to fall. One just a couple years older is worth half that, they go for nothing - but they are pretty old looking nowadays."
32,2012-03-26T20:59:42+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, I think prices plunge when you first buy it, then they level off after a while.

For the cost of a Scion iQ I'd take the RL SH-AWD with 80k miles, yeah...."
33,2012-03-26T21:02:32+00:00,fintail,I bet you could find one with 50K or even less on it for 1K more. And that price is a base iQ - one I saw on the lot here was over 20K! Bang for the buck is seldom brand new.
34,2012-03-27T15:43:02+00:00,ateixeira,"For that money get a Prius C at the same store. Bigger and more fuel efficient, so you're not really making any trade offs, either."
35,2012-03-27T17:24:21+00:00,fintail,"Nor would you be forced to take on a few grand worth of mandatory ""optional"" accessories - although from what I hear, a base Prius C is pretty rare too.

Smart failed at something like 12K, can't see how the iQ will cut it for much more."
36,2012-03-27T17:45:35+00:00,ateixeira,"I thought the ForTwo was more like $16k? Maybe that's how they all came equipped. Worst transmission I've ever sampled.

http://fitzmall.com/ has 4 iQs but they're all $16.2-16.4k, so probably un-customized.

Even at that price a Yaris makes so much more sense."
37,2012-03-27T17:53:54+00:00,fintail,"I think base sticker was 12-13 at most. Probably like some other cars, hard to find a base one, dealers want the profit margins.

Now that we are finally getting decent enough small cars - all of them from all makers seem to be much improved, buying a tiny city car like a Smart or iQ is only for image or if you really need the smaller footprint - as the normal car often has just as good mileage, not to mention comfort and practicality."

Most ForTwos I've seen were that way, some small business plastered on the side.

Today's sub-compacts are actually decent cars, though. Direct injection engines and more features than an 80s luxury car, they're not the wheezy econoboxes I saw back in college. Remember the 4 on the floor, vinyl seats, and passenger side mirror optional?

40,2012-03-27T18:07:50+00:00,fintail,"I remember a local ""green car"" dealer was grey market importing them and asking like 25-27K! This was back around when the housing market peaked too - maybe not unconnected.

BMW and Audi dealers had more, saw a gorgeous loaded A8 (which made the normal A8s beside it look invisible) and a few new 3ers and many leftover 11 3ers along with several 6ers which seem to have been there for ages, nothing else unusual. Lexus dealer has a ton of CTs and new GSs, so they aren't in short supply. Scion dealer had a base ~16K iQ along with a couple wearing the 4K ""Axis"" (seriously) package, Toyota dealer had nothing remarkable but a ton of new Camrys.

37,2012-04-23T13:51:36+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Spent some time with the new Acura RDX yesterday and I walked away pretty impressed. The salesperson we spoke with was highly informed, thorough and answered all of my questions to ""T"". We went through all the features, even down to the standard stuff like the cupholders and then without any sort of pressure, handed the keys for a test drive. They grabbed a copy of my liscence and we were off...

The Drive: Being based on the CR-V I was expecting a lot of the roots to show through clearly, but I was surprised at how quiet and refined the RDX was. Having owned a 2003 MDX which my wife loved outside of the gas mileage, the engine was familiar, the interior layout, seat comfort (very good btw, not Volvo but close) was all very familiar. What was nice was while the MDX felt like an elephant on the road, the RDX was a very comfortable size. More like driving a Toyota RAV4.

The ride was fantastic, soaked up bumps like a champ and there was handly an upset in the chassis. This is one of the big things I look for when buying, I hate having to make severe corrections to a vehicle after rebounding from a pothole, bump, etc...

The engine was straight out of our old MDX, and in the RDX, it was smooth quiet and gutsy. Not once did I have to put the pedal to the floor to merge or pass other cars. a little kick and it would drop a gear and accelerate with plenty of gusto, never needing that extra kick down to an even lower gear ratio. The transmission is all new, a 6 Speed auto with paddles (that I didn't use). Put it in Auto and it accelerated with ease, although the thing didn't feel like a rocket like I was expecting. Quick but not blistering. The RAV4 V6 will waste it off the line and highway passing, but then again it weighs probably 300 - 400 lbs less.

One note about Honda autos that I don't like. I don't know if anyone else notices this, but for some reason Honda's V6 drivetrains always feel like they are being ""held back"". It's really hard to explain, but it almost feels like the thing is carrying a 2000 lb load behind it. Sorta strained I guess, but more like re-strained as in engineered for strength rather than lithe...

Oh and the tech... This one was a loaded AWD with the tech package. Pretty neat features including a 3-view backup camera (probably used on other makes as well but it was cool). The ELS sound, my gosh... Incredible. Even in a Crossover the bass response, the clarity, the crispness... Fantastic. But as other reviews have mentioned ,there is no Blind spot detection (I could care less about that one), adaptive cruise (I never use Cruise) pre-crash stuff, found in those German makes. But I was not really phased (again I never use the stuff = wouldn't really miss it )

Lastly, it all came down to the looks. And... well... Meh. Not bad, but not stunning either. I feel like most Acuras nowadays you don't really ""arrive"" rather than ""just show up"". There was no elegance, no ""presence"" and certainly no attitude. It was just a decent looking, no frills, bubbly, soft roader with tall, skinny, boring wheels and forgettable style. Interior was definitely the high point with it.

In the end, I walked. I wasn't really planning on buying but I was interested in checking it out thoroughly. And did walk away mostly impressed. For the money it's a compelling choice against rivals like the X3, Q5, GLK (maybe) or Infiniti EX. But my top pick in this price is still the XC60...

Unless, you spring for a non-tech which lowers the price by a couple of grand, well under the Bimmer and the Audi and right in line with the deals Infiniti is giving to move their slow selling EX.

But in the end, it is not a vehicle I really aspire to own... Nice, but...

BTW, the handling was pretty good in the new RDX. But I don't think buyers in this class cared about handling in the first place. Mileage is the priority now and 28mpg (FWD) and 27mpg (AWD) highway numbers are a few ticks better than the RX and with more hp to boot.

I see the Lexus RX as the RDX's most direct competition."

And probably a retiree inside.

I've heard them marketed as ""simulated convertibles"", LOL. As a convertible owner the last thing I want is a top-UP look on a car.

Inside the Venza is nicer than the Highlander for sure, but I'd still opt for the extra cargo space of the HL if I had to choose between the two. Sienna crushes both - tons more space and you really don't sacrifice much dynamically, and it actually cost less back in 2007."

At this point, I really want to see the new Escape (This month? June?), the Dart (June) and Santa Fe (probably September). I think though that is all of the pending stuff that I have an interest in seeing, for a practical reason, other than seeing something new!

Only found out yesterday that the Santa Fe is going to come in 2 models (standard 5 seats with 4 cyl power, and a stretched 3 row model with V6)."

OK, first a correction, must've been an LTZ, not just LT.

Yeah, sticker in the low 27s carries a street price of $25.5k.

2012 Porsche Boxster: 250 days
2012 Infiniti M35h: 174 days
2012 Infiniti EX35: 134 days
2012 BMW 650i convertible: 128 days
2012 Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet: 120 days
2012 Volkswagen Eos: 115 days

2012 BMW 750Li xDrive: 114 days
2012 Nissan NV cargo van: 113 days
2012 BMW 640i coupe: 111 days

Boxster is low demand, but looks like they made way too many.

M35h - I'm guessing hybrid shopper don't even enter their store. Also the whole performance hybrid thing is an oxymoron since they're so heavy.

EX - told ya it's too small. It's new-ish, too, so that's really bad news.

CrossCabrio is also on there, looks like Nissan overestimated demand for ugly/expensive.

I've been seeing more and more of these. They are ungainly but I think many small mom and pop shops are leery of the Sprinter. We here wouldn't blink at it but Mrs. Smith might not like the idea of her plumber showing up in a vehicle with a 3 pointed star on it.

I think the new T series from Ford will be the one that gets the Euro style van accepted into the US marketplace."

I had to take a trip in it once and I was amazed at the gas mileage. I can't remember exactly but it was low 20s at 75-80. It also was packed to the gills."

A few new cars out at mid-day - saw a Veloster. a new MB badged Sprinter cargo van with a 36K ""Costco member"" MSRP, and a late model C-class in the nicest color - quartz blue."

New CRVs are almost a daily sight here now. Also saw a Lexus CT doing loaner service, hope this doesn't mean sales are slow, as for loaners, the dealer previous used the hybrid HS250h hybrid h that barely anyone bought."
49,2012-05-21T17:12:00+00:00,stickguy,"The CRV does hit a sweet spot for many people (which is why we might end up getting one!). Far from exciting, and no rocket, but it does a lot of things well (mpg/performance/comfort/etc.), and is a nice size (compact but plenty of room) and is loaded with neat features. Combine a reasonable (for a new car) price, and the Honda badge, and not surprising it is selling well.

my wife found it comfortable and nice to drive, and it felt ""right"" to her coming out of an Odyssey. Honda may have lost their way a bit lately, but they still know how to do ergonomics (at least when they keep the button count down)."

Both are very sharp looking cars IMO, although I think the front end styling works the best on the XC than it does on the S60.

Oh, and the XC90 seems to be a pretty long lasting vehicle as well, I see a ton of them on the road as well, most of them the older T-5 and 3.2 models. My wife and I were actually driving to the Cape last weekend and we were literally sharing the highway with (5) XC90's at the same time! I also looked over at the traffic heading the opposite direction adn saw (2) more at the same time...

I don't know if it is indicative of the overall state of Volvo at the moment, but I am glad to see they are still selling well as I have always really like the style and that minimalist Scandanvian interior sheme. :shades:"

Also, seeing a few more of those new Passats. I don't know... ya, it's a little more generic than the older Passats, but for some reason it just looks more solid and the details really make it a handsome vehicle, especially in Black when it's been detailed up.

Got passed by a CC yesterday as well. One of the best looking cars on the road IMO. At least in the under 40k pricepoint"
7,2012-05-22T19:17:00+00:00,ateixeira,"Wonder what that Tig cost, though. They really get up there.

I think the Q5 is much nicer looking, and of course costs more."
8,2012-05-22T19:37:55+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I priced out an SEL and got it up around 35k with pretty much all the options. An SE would satisfy me though and that one rung in around 32k.

From what I gather, the new Escape can get into the middle thirties as well, so the price isn't unnusual.

I used to like the Q5, but the S-Line is really the only trim I like and that sucker is almost 50 grand :surprise: Yikes. I'd rather get an afformentioned XC60-T6 and 60 thousand miles of maintainence for 41-42 grand. I think the Q uses premium as well if I am not mistaken?"
9,2012-05-22T20:20:31+00:00,stickguy,"I don't care for them much, but I do really like the Kia Soul (and see quite a few of them).

Edit: Just noticed the upgraded Nav with touchscreen is in that price as well. Still the SEL Premium gets a Navi which is what I would get.

I do agree tho that 35 grand for a compact ute is a bit much."

$17k is cheap."

Scratch that, gas is almost free again. They won't care until the next time gas prices spike (consumers are naive and think short-term).

$17k plus freight and $89 processing, IIRC. Still dirt cheap. Those are big sedans.

My buddy in Annapolis has one. The seat's way too low for my tastes, hard to get in and out of. The CVT is actually good, Nissan should teach other companies how to get those right. His stereo is also quite good, and it's not even a loaded model. Decent car overall and a real bargain at that price."

The Nissan NV is a box. It could be the box a Leaf came in.

That is a serious deficiency I've noticed on several Toyota's since I'm over 6ft tall. I can't get comfortable with the sunroof, so it precludes me from considering something like a Camry other than the base models since leather requires a sunroof. Base model Toyota's sometimes seem a bit short in thigh support as well on longer drives. I've also found some of the Ford's lack legroom for taller drivers. Luckily, there are lots of choices out there, so it pays to test drive thoroughly or rent before you buy."

10,2012-06-12T12:39:35+00:00,tjc78,Probably one of three made.
11,2012-06-12T14:07:36+00:00,stickguy,"and damned, I would go look at it except that it does not seem to have a moonroof! what are people thinking when the order cars?"
12,2012-06-12T14:12:19+00:00,texases,"In my case, headroom. None of my cars have had a sunroof, and none will, if I can keep finding them."
13,2012-06-12T14:13:35+00:00,qbrozen,"damn you, stick. I think you might have trumped this rarity I just posted on the CCBA board."
14,2012-06-12T18:03:17+00:00,ateixeira,"Unicorn all the way.

Isn't that the final year they were made?

Last of the Mohicans."
15,2012-06-13T19:40:54+00:00,kyfdx,"They tried to butch it up.... looks too much like the Outback in the rear...

The previous 2008-11 model was better looking..."
16,2012-06-13T19:47:39+00:00,andys120,"Got a quick look at the new 3 Series (F30) this AM, it was the same shade of red as the one in the TV ads. It looks better in the metal than in photos which make the nose seem a bit too long.

I also saw my first Toyota Prius C it was smaller and better looking than the ""big"" Prius ."
17,2012-06-13T19:55:45+00:00,ateixeira,"I like the new one more.

Though the funny thing is, I used to like the hatch more, now I think the sedan is better looking.

Sales have more than doubled, though that may largely be due to the MPG improvement."
18,2012-06-13T19:57:07+00:00,ateixeira,The c is about the length of my Miata. It is a lot smaller...
19,2012-06-14T02:26:23+00:00,stickguy,"Finally saw one in person. Actually 2 (an SE that we drove, and an SEL in the lot).

Pretty flashy, but a bit overdone in some areas (in and out). But overall, light years ahead of the old one!"
20,2012-06-14T02:35:51+00:00,kyfdx,"Looks good, in a nice inoffensive, generic way..."
21,2012-06-14T13:22:42+00:00,ateixeira,"I swear that's what I thought I read, for a second or two.

Alas, 'twas a Verano.

Of course Buick hopes it'll make the brand more youthful, so maybe I was right!

Also saw 2 Leafs. Leaves?"
22,2012-06-15T18:12:55+00:00,tjc78,"New Range Rover Evoque. Really good looking SUV in a stunning red color.

Stick, DO NOT show this one to your wife. You will be begging her to buy the RDX. :shades:"
23,2012-06-15T18:55:13+00:00,stickguy,"I can guarantee that she will hate it, so not worried there.

She did, however, really like the Porsche Cayanne, but that is a tad out of the price range!

she actually asked me today, what I would get. I picked the 2013 outback. And only partly because it would keep about $7,500 in our pockets (real cost differential). I also really liked it, and think it would be an excellent choice for us.

I actually made it a decision for her of the OB or a CRV. Basically the same price if anything, the sube is cheaper."
24,2012-06-15T19:11:28+00:00,tjc78,"She did, however, really like the Porsche Cayanne

My Fiance loves them too. Waayyyyy out of my price range I can tell you that.

I just saw in SFTSF NYC's parents have one and just cost them over $500 for an oil change. :surprise:

I picked the 2013 outback

I have only driven one Subaru, which was a first generation Forester it was a competent little wagon. I know quite a few people that just love their Subis to death. A solid choice.

What are you doing with the van? Going to trade it or Craigs?"
25,2012-06-15T20:06:04+00:00,stickguy,"Craig's baby. wanna buy it?

after selling my Accord (one of those ""unsellable"" stick shifts) the first weekend for just under asking, I'll use that again. I pocketed 3k on that move (over trading it in), even after deducting the sales tax credit.

There is an advantage to having a Honda with reasonable miles on it (the Odyssey is a 2005, just hitting 73K now).

I don't expect it to be a hard item to sell."
26,2012-06-15T20:08:25+00:00,fintail,"Haven't seen anything new of note in my past week or so in FL and GA. Saw a couple SLS cabrios in Miami Beach, but there's a good chance those were exotic rentals. I've noticed more Volts here than on the west coast, which surprises me. One thing I have noticed by its absence is Subaru - people don't buy them down here."
27,2012-06-17T06:00:06+00:00,tifighter,"Neighbor down the street just picked up an electric Focus in a silvery blue color. Didn't know these were available yet, but at least the mini-Aston front end is distinctive from other Foci."
28,2012-06-17T13:32:19+00:00,fintail,"Looked at cars with my friend here yesterday, as he is always kind of thinking to replace his miled up Accord. Stopped at a college town MB dealer - salesman said bluetec cars sell poorly there, and nobody will touch their relatively base E350 wagon - but the gasser Es with sport and lower cars do sell. Odd...on the west coast, wagons and diesels don't seem to sit on the local lot for long. They also had a new E63 and S63 sitting around, can't imagine those will be an easy sale. Adjacent Nissan and VW dealers (same owner group no doubt) made it clear they would club a baby seal to make a deal, very strong sales pushes."
29,2012-06-17T15:08:41+00:00,lemko,What's Bluetec?
30,2012-06-17T15:32:09+00:00,tjc78,Fancy name for diesel.
31,2012-06-17T22:13:32+00:00,fintail,"The marketing driven name for MB diesels, based on the emissions system...you will know one when you see one, as they are badged on the trunklid.

Right now, NA gets a bluetec E sedan and S-class along with ML and GL, and the bluetec C and GLK are coming soon."
32,2012-06-18T02:53:58+00:00,texases,"I think the BlueTec includes the urea injection, right?"
33,2012-06-18T15:58:00+00:00,ateixeira,"absence is Subaru - people don't buy them down here

Useless trivia factoid: Subaru's market share in Vermont is 14 (yes, fourteen) times what they have in Florida.

Funny.

It's not just the AWD - Subarus are not flashy and pretentious enough.

You still in Miami Beach? Notice even the mannequins in store windows are, um, shall we say, turbocharged?"
34,2012-06-18T16:04:47+00:00,ateixeira,"had a new E63 and S63 sitting around, can't imagine those will be an easy sale

Lots of folks in Miami have big money, I'm sure they'll sell.

Took my nephews there last summer, and they almost didn't leave the parking lot. I think we saw 3 Lamborghinis, just parked.

They also saw a Ferrari and a Spyker. Pretty cool for a little kid from a small town in Brazil."
35,2012-06-18T16:27:08+00:00,ateixeira,"How can you see out of those things?

Don't you love how automakers remove windows, then get you to pay thousands for surround-view cameras."
36,2012-06-18T17:42:17+00:00,lemko,Spotted a red Can Am Spyder travelling west on Rhawn Street near Tabor Avenue in NE Philly.
37,2012-06-18T18:11:06+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw one of these boxes running down the road.

Funny, it looks small on the bottom, but huge on top. Almost like a box truck fell on top of a Sentra.

That's an illusion. It's just that the sides go straight up. It's as wide at the top as it is at the bottom."
38,2012-06-19T12:23:23+00:00,fushigi,In white. Luckily I hadn't had lunch yet.
39,2012-06-19T13:02:01+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Saw one this morning in kind of a yellowish, green color. Big thumbs down on the styling IMO, I liked the old one a lot better.

Saw a Blue Subaru BRZ on the highway yesterday afternoon. I'm really digging this one, need to take it for a spin.

Also a couple of JX Infinitis, those seem to be selling well.

Neighbor a couple of streets over bought a new CX-5 this weekend, they had one of those Pontiac Torrent clones before this. They also have a 2012 CR-V which they got back in March/April timeframe which replaced an older Ford Edge.

Another neighbor brought home a loaded Ridgeline that he traded his 375k mile Toyota Solara for. The dealer actually gave him 2500 bucks for his Solara!

I'm still toying with a new vehicle for myself. My 2007 Impreza hatch is going to hit 100k soon and I'm getting the itch. It's tough because other than brakes, tires and a PCV Valve cleaning, she needs nothing at all. The battery is starting to go maybe as she has had a couple of hard starts lately, but 31mpg, manual hatches are rare and I love this one but I'd like a few more ""toys"". Current vehicles in the running are the new Acura RDX, JGC and Volvo XC60."
40,2012-06-19T13:52:21+00:00,ateixeira,"May be hard to find a BRZ in stock, and even if you do there may not be test drives unless they know you're a serious buyer.

CX5 is nice, if a bit small, but the small engine is taxed with all that weight, at least the loaded AWD automatic we sampled.

31mpg, manual hatches are rare

Another Impreza, a Focus, Golf TDI, or Mazda3 SkyActiv. Those are my suggestions."
41,2012-06-19T13:53:05+00:00,lemko,...blue Ford Fiesta at Rising Sun and Knorr in NE Philly.
42,2012-06-19T13:53:10+00:00,ateixeira,"Temp tags and all, with so many LEDs you'd think they just wrapped Xmas rope lighting around the whole car. This is getting tacky."
43,2012-06-19T14:01:01+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Thanks for the recommendations juice. My plan is to keep my little Impreza for as along as I can. But my commute is about 50 miles each way and I think something a little bigger, more comfortable and effortless acceleration are in order.

Like my S2k, the Impreza will be used on those good weather days (I have kept it in immaculate condition), maybe I'll even get into a bit of tuning and getting her out on a local trackday.

Out of the three choices, I would definitely go with the new Impreza tho. Love our Scoobydoos!"
44,2012-06-19T14:09:16+00:00,stickguy,"based on that criteria, if you aren't obsessed with every last MPG, you should really like the RDX."
45,2012-06-19T14:17:35+00:00,ateixeira,"The new ones get dramatically better gas mileage. Back seat is HUGE. Dwarfs the Mazda3.

Heck, the back seat has a lot more leg room than the CX5."
46,2012-06-19T18:17:58+00:00,fintail,"I think that's the origin of the name, yes."
47,2012-06-19T18:21:12+00:00,fintail,"Oh, this was in Athens, GA, Nice college town, but probably not a good market for 100K+ cars (well, the E63 was pretty base, 95K).

Miami Beach is a good place for exotic rentals, too. Saw a Phantom Cabrio on one rental lot, aside various sundry Lambos, Ferraris, and 2x SLS.

I spotted this new Bentley coupe cruising among all the Sunday evening douchiness on Ocean Dr.:"
48,2012-06-19T18:22:24+00:00,fintail,"""This is getting tacky""

More copycat sycophant designers at work."
49,2012-06-19T18:24:23+00:00,fintail,"Probably a good 10x in Seattle vs FL, too. I saw only a couple Subies apart from a few trashed loud WRX in FL.

Miami Beach is its own planet. Fun for awhile, but I have found I prefer things from about the space coast northward.

Oh, I swear I saw a new Fusion on the highway in northern FL yesterday, but it was a split second corner of the eye glimpse, so maybe not. Also saw a Verano on a small old time multi GM make dealer somewhere in southern GA."
0,2012-06-19T18:46:52+00:00,ateixeira,"DC is the polar opposite of Miami. Conservative, banking town, boring.

I like visiting Miami, though, in a point-and-laugh kind of way. I think more people speak Spanish there than English. Depends on what part of town, I suppose."
1,2012-06-19T18:49:42+00:00,fintail,"Many parts of the area made me think of what the more developed parts of South America must be like...and not only in good ways.

DC is probably about as corrupt as Miami, anyway."

6,2012-06-20T16:26:33+00:00,tifighter,"I had to look on the Nissan website to see this. They call it 'Carribean', and some designer probably thought it was 'ocean-inspired'.

Talk about making a salesperson's job even harder..."
7,2012-06-20T16:46:49+00:00,fintail,Saw a white Fisker Karma
8,2012-06-21T01:43:20+00:00,fintail,"Saw my first FR-S on the road today, or was it a Subaru Breeze, I don't know"
9,2012-06-21T15:11:55+00:00,ateixeira,"Limiting supply was a brilliant move by Subaru.

WRX sales were up 159% for May. Keep in mind how old that model is - it debuted in 2007!

People come to see one, none in stock, fine I'll buy a WRX instead.

Numbers are slightly skewed by the tsunami, but they were still way ahead of 2010.

The old bait-and-switch."
10,2012-06-21T15:58:11+00:00,fintail,"If that was the plan, it is indeed brilliant. Maybe some good deals to be found on a WRX, too.

Personally, I wouldn't play along with any artificial supply restrictions...we all know what eventually happens. I remember PT Cruisers initially bringing 25K+, in year 2000 dollars."
11,2012-06-21T16:00:25+00:00,ateixeira,"I'm reading 10k Scions and 6k Subaru. Supply will be short for a year or two.

Around here dealers are getting MSRP, so no markups, but there is a wait list."
12,2012-06-21T16:04:02+00:00,fintail,"I'd predict MSRP for at least the first year, if not more. It's not an expensive car, and there isn't much competition."
13,2012-06-21T16:24:00+00:00,ateixeira,"There isn't. A lot of people don't want a roadster (Miata), and the Genny coupe is gigantic sitting next to one (edit: and 700 lbs heavier, yikes).

R&T compared the 3:

http://www.roadandtrack.com/tests/comparison/mazda-mx-5-miata-vs-subaru-brz-vs-h- - yundai-genesis-coupe

They're right about the Miata having too much body roll (even with the Bilsteins and torsen LSD package), but getting the GT misses the point. It's not about having leather and Bose audio..."
14,2012-06-21T16:40:10+00:00,fintail,"I'd probably take the Breeze over those two. Miata is too small for me, and just when I had accepted the Genesis looks, they weirded up the front end."
15,2012-06-21T16:52:17+00:00,ateixeira,"Too bad you can't get the old look with the new output.

It's too heavy for a 2+2, IMHO. Needs a diet and a better shifter. :shades:"
16,2012-06-21T17:02:13+00:00,fintail,"And eventually less KDM flair. The gaping maw front end is not flattering. I guess for the price, there are compromises...if I wanted a big 2+2, I'd also seriously shop the improved new Mustang."
17,2012-06-21T18:17:07+00:00,ateixeira,"Those are a bargain and even the V6 performs, but I still want something much lighter if the back seat is that small.

One of my bosses has one with Sync. A lot of car for the $."
18,2012-06-21T18:25:02+00:00,fintail,"I don't have devilspawn, back seat only matters so much to me :shades:

Good time to be a car shopper though, lots of nice choices at 25K or less."

Got a nice old GSA office chair last week at the thrift too - just toss that stuff in and no worries if it rains.

Haven't seen any new cars in weeks. Would you count a '58 peach Cadillac or a nice old MG? Guess Shifty handles those spottings.

There was a red Prius in town with PA plates last night but it could have been an '04 for all I know. :shades:"

New restorations should count. Get a pic?"
26,2012-06-21T21:03:12+00:00,stever,"No, and it was just well maintained. Had a classic plate on it but naturally I've forgotten the year. For some reason I remembered the Caddy, maybe because it had a '58 vanity plate."
27,2012-06-22T01:56:09+00:00,fintail,Saw a facelift Lexus RX on the road this afternoon - it's nothing but a new grille from all I can tell. Trying hard to gain some kind of identity.

35,2012-06-24T19:56:42+00:00,stickguy,"an R8 GT. Cheating, because it was in the showroom. But man, the MSRP! Over 171K for that baby.

enough to make the 13/19 MPG ratings irrelevant."

That Scion is in front of a dealer from a different brand, so at least it's not a Scion dealership. They're supposed to be a no-haggle environment and I'm sure Toyota would slap them on the wrist, and not allocate any more to them.

Then again, probably some under the table deal where they split the profit. Worst part is some DB will buy it."
40,2012-06-25T14:15:41+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a Silver one parked outside the Ocean City, MD skate park. Wonder how they can afford one, or maybe they just parked there and walked to the beach?

I paid 1/3 of MSRP for my E55 after 4 years and barely over 25K miles. I think I have fallen below the halfway point now though, guzzlers depreciate."

Other popular rides over there are all generations of 4Runner, many Jeeps and slew of Mini Coopers which, if I was living there, that would be my wheels.

Stopped by a Toyota dealer on the way home and checked out the new FR-S. Also spotted an R8 roadster, a Bentley Continental GT and yet no Range Rovers at all. lol"

Just danged expensive!"

I bet it's geared taller than the outgoing turbo 4 was. Don't really need to look at the spec sheet to tell you that.

A Prius would make me more efficient in more ways than gas savings (assuming I didn't double my road trip frequency).

We went camping the last few days and I spent a lot of time digging around the back of the minivan looking for stuff I had just tossed in. Figures, since I packed all the camping gear, food, bikes and canoe in just an hour or so.

Back in my sedan road-tripping days, I'd sort my lists by what part of the car gear was packed in and could always put my hands on whatever we needed in a few minutes. The big empty of a minivan has just made me lazier than usual."

Most interesting thing was an unusual red CLS. I don't recall an S or CL in public view. Porsche dealer across the street had a 2013 Lexus GS on its used car lot - odd.

A few Infiniti JX models this morning, funny all the ones I see are black.

Couple of new Ford Escapes, I still think it looks like they were trying to ""out-style"" the Kia Sportage.

Toyota dealer in town has another FR-S on the display out front. I need to get down and drive one of those.

Went into Boston for the 4th and saw a couple of RR Evoques. They did a really good job on the looks IMO. Also saw a few new Lexus GS's, the Carbon Gray really works for the profile. Also saw a new SLK350 parked in the Back Bay."
36,2012-07-08T23:58:38+00:00,fintail,Got behind a freshly plated Scion Freeze today - driver seemed to be breaking it in gently or something - accelerating like my grandmother.
37,2012-07-10T00:20:37+00:00,andre1969,"This past weekend, I went to the Mopar show in Carlisle, PA. They had a Dart there that you could sit in. I'm kinda rooting for the Dart, but was worried about some of the pics I've seen. At some angles, the roofline makes me think of the previous-generation Hyundai Elantra. But, in person, I think the car looks a LOT better than in the pics. I sat in it, and was impressed with the front seat room. It still feels like a compact car IMO, but a fairly roomy compact car. And, with the seat adjusted all the way back for my 6'3"" frame, I could still fit in the back seat. However, it was a bit tight, and I had to straddle the front seatback to do it. Compared to a Chevy Cruze, I'd say it felt a bit bigger in front, but a bit tighter in back. The trunk was about average for this class of car I'd guess. Definitely smaller than a Cruze, and it had some gooseneck hinges that looked pretty intrusive.

My opinion of the car is still a little mixed. Definitely a valiant effort for Chrysler, and a huge improvement over the old Neon and Calibre. But, somehow, I just got the impression that if I bought a car like this, I'd be settling, somehow, and constantly second-guessing myself. But, I think that might be more me than the car. I'm simply used to bigger cars.

This evening, I went with a friend of mine to go pick up his '06 Xterra from servicing at the dealer. He had a 2012 or older Altima for a loaner. Hate to say it, but the more I get hands-on experience with the Altima, the less I like it. To be fair though, this was a cheap trim level. The interior didn't seem bad, but the seats just seem small, like they put compact car seats in a midsize. It was a bit rough-riding, and on rough roads I noticed something I haven't seen on modern cars in a long, long time. Hood-shimmy. It wasn't nearly as extreme as, say, a '76 Eldorado convertible, but I could see it was there.

Sometimes, ignorance is bliss, I guess. I kinda miss the old days, before I knew what orange peel was, or knew to look for fit and finish issues, body flex, etc. The more you learn about that kind of stuff, the more you notice it.

Another thing I wasn't so crazy about, was that the seats seemed really low. The driver's side did have a lever that would ratchet the seat up and down, but as it came up, it seemed to pitch forward a bit. Maybe a power seat would correct that? On the plus side though, the car was eerily quiet, and had good power.

When we got to the Nissan dealer, I noticed they had a 2013 Altima there. it was a V-6 model. Leather, sunroof, but no nav. Sticker price of $31,400. This was another car that I wasn't so crazy about when I saw it in pictures. But, like the Dart, I think it looks a LOT better in person. And, $31,400 actually doesn't sound half bad. I'll have to check this one out when I'm in the market for a new car."
38,2012-07-10T12:26:50+00:00,tjc78,"The Dart absolutely looks like a previous gen Elantra, I think we talked about that somewhere here on the boards.

As for the Altima. I've had considerable seat time in both a V6 and the 4. Both were loaded to the gills with NAV. I never thought they were a bad car, but the NVH levels are higher than the Camry (on par with Accord) and while plenty of leg room I was never completely comfortable. The CVT is annoying and the ride is firm (especially in the V6) for my tastes.

If I was going midsize Altima would probably be pretty far down on my list.

When you are looking for a new ride, I have to recommend the current LaCrosse. I really love mine. It retains a very nice ride while dialing out some of the ""float"" plenty of power and decent MPG for a 4000lb+ car."
39,2012-07-10T12:59:43+00:00,hoosiergrandad,"Don't know that Chrysler would appreciate you describing the effort they put into the new Dart as ""valiant""."
40,2012-07-10T13:16:13+00:00,andre1969,"The Dart absolutely looks like a previous gen Elantra, I think we talked about that somewhere here on the boards.

Yep, in fact it was you that first brought my attention to it. I had forgotten what the previous-gen Elantra looked like, but was thinking that something about the Dart seemed a bit Hyundai-ish. And then, that evening, I saw a previous-gen Elantra in the parking lot at work and thought crap, it's a dead ringer!

But, in person I do think it looks a lot better."
41,2012-07-10T13:19:30+00:00,andre1969,"Don't know that Chrysler would appreciate you describing the effort they put into the new Dart as ""valiant"".

I dunno...you think they'd really be all that furyous about it? I think the Dart could be a pretty good challenger in this field. Some might find the looks a bit polaraizing though.

Sorry, I think that's the heat stroke talking. :P"
42,2012-07-10T13:42:11+00:00,hoosiergrandad,"Just kidding ,Andre.......if Chrysler views their effort on the original Valiant with pride, I don't guess they'd mind."

I think they should advertise them with Neon lights, create a Dynasty and people will come in Caravans to buy them.

ducking and running"
44,2012-07-10T16:21:36+00:00,berri,"The compact market is interesting because D3 offers what seems to me to be 3 very different choices: Dart, Focus and Cruze. Cars are individual things. Personally, with the great 4 bangers out there these days I don't see the reason not to go a bit larger than a compact. I don't think the total cost of ownership is big enough versus the tradeoffs.

As for the Altima, I like them but to me they are more tiresome on a long trip than a Camry. The Malibu had nice seats and legroom even if the vehicle was a bit narrow. However, I didn't feel the 2.4L 4 banger was as smooth as some of the alternatives. I haven't driven the brand new model yet though and expect the 2.5L will be a better driver."
45,2012-07-10T16:27:33+00:00,stickguy,"at this point, the Dart to me is above a compact. More like a mid-size. and a Camry/Accord are pretty much full size at this point!

and, not everyone actually wants a bigger car (footprint) even if the cost is not that much higher. But, you do have a point in that at least basedon the EPA #s, some of the larger options get nearly the same mileage 9at least on the highway) as smaller cars.

also, one thing I have seen mentioned in all the Altima reviews is how comfortable the new front seats are. I will be interested in trying them out myself."
46,2012-07-10T16:39:08+00:00,berri,"I'll be interested in that new seat technology. But I'm not sure it was the seats. More like the chassis ride and maybe the transaxle droning that I got tired of after awhile. I never really was bothered by CVT shifting though. I think the Nissan's get a lot of different opinions by people who drive them for whatever reasons. As for seats, one thing I don't like in a lot of Asian seats is that many seem to have short seat bottoms and backs. Reminds me of why I'm not all that fond of being a passenger in a 737."
47,2012-07-10T21:54:42+00:00,zeeboy,"Honda must have missed the mark to redesign the Civic after one model year.

Right now, the Yaris and the Fit are better than their compact siblings (Corolla/Civic)

In 2013 when the Corolla and Civics are redesigned perhaps that'll change."
48,2012-07-10T23:59:31+00:00,fintail,"I have to believe the new Altima will be worlds better, much like the 02 leapfrogged the 01. The 2012 Altima is like an Asian branded Impala, much of them are rental fodder, solid but less than appealing for enthusiasts.

Speaking of Nissan, saw an Infiniti JX today, with the different for the sake of different rear kink...the market doesn't have enough heavy estrogen laden CUVs. Also saw a Lexus IS cabrio, top up of course, going way under the limit, driver sitting about 2"" from the wheel."

Saleswoman, who was shockingly knowledgeable about past models - drooled over my E55. She told me there's a reason the lot seldom has anything older than 5 years old on the lot - the employees buy the older MB trade-ins.

They have a crazy lease deal on a normal spec E350 - 499/month, usual 5K upfront. That's about 10% cheaper than the MBUSA site rate. Must be some excess stock sitting around.

Also saw a Scion Freeze, black."

27,2012-07-18T16:40:48+00:00,anythngbutgm,"on the highway last night, are these even out yet? :confuse:

Also saw my first, and then my second new RX with the whole ""Spindle Grill"" thing. It looks good IMO but not really as polarizing as I was expecting."
28,2012-07-19T01:44:07+00:00,fintail,"Saw two FR-S today, one white still sitting at a used car lot, one black on the road."
29,2012-07-19T12:45:30+00:00,tjc78,"Did the Avalon have an awful (giant) lower front grill? If so than it is the 2013.

They aren't out yet as far as I know."
30,2012-07-19T14:06:37+00:00,lemko,Sad. The Avalon was about the only Toyota-branded product I would consider and they had to go ahead and ruin it.
31,2012-07-19T14:18:02+00:00,tjc78,"I've had two Avalons (03 and 06) and I would run away screaming from the 2013. It is a styling debacle if I've ever seen one.

I think they also made it smaller, what's the point? Its not like it didn't already have a small overlap with the V6 Camry XLE and a lower optioned ES350.

Oh well, I'll look elsewhere when the Buick's lease is up."
32,2012-07-19T14:34:43+00:00,lemko,Maybe I'd consider a used Avalon as a replacement for my Mercury Grand Marquis. My wife and I saw a 2012 at the Philly Auto Show this past February and thought it was nice.
33,2012-07-19T14:53:13+00:00,tjc78,"You would like the Avalon (05-12). It has a very soft ride, lots of smooth quiet power, is comfortable and will pull 29-30mpg at 70-75MPH. Mine was very reliable as well.

It does a lot of what the Panther platform vehicles do well and actually has a bit more rear leg room (but less trunk space)

They are usually pretty pricey used and I'd bet you could get a late model Town Car for the same price or cheaper."
34,2012-07-19T17:40:47+00:00,lemko,Panthers of any sort are getting scarce around here. The livery drivers are snatching them all up. I would consider a late model Town Car. Latter day Grand Marquises seem very decontented and I don't like how the stylists shrank the headlamps. The front end looks awkward compared to my 2005 model.
35,2012-07-19T17:53:39+00:00,texases,"""It is a styling debacle if I've ever seen one. ""

YIKES! I hadn't seen it. Kinda like a Camry and the 2013 Fusion had love child..."
36,2012-07-19T18:01:05+00:00,tjc78,"Grand Marquises seem very decontented

Yes they stripped away the air ride, power pedals, power pass seat, power lumbar, and you'll never find one with heated seats.

The market just became flooded with a bunch of 2011 Crown Vic LXs (equipped just like the last MGMs). Many of them are available in the 16-17K range with under 20K miles. That is a lot of car for money.

They had to have come from a rental company, because as far as I know the last Vics were not sold to the public."
37,2012-07-19T18:01:47+00:00,tjc78,"YIKES!

I still don't know how that got approved. :confuse:"
38,2012-07-19T18:12:26+00:00,fintail,"Good! Don't have to worry about getting one as a future rental. Although Hertz will probably keep them around until 50K++ miles.

Speaking of rentals, that's where the last batch of old/clean style Avalons have headed. Maybe a good used buy in another several months.

That new one is just a mess, different for the sake of being different, lame desperate attempt to add personality to a car. Does the lower grille have any function at all?"
39,2012-07-19T18:16:48+00:00,tjc78,"Although Hertz will probably keep them around until 50K++ miles.

When I was renting a lot of cars, I used National. I don't think I ever got into a car with more than 10K miles. Many were practically brand new.

Speaking of rentals, that's where the last batch of old/clean style Avalons have headed. Maybe a good used buy in another several months.

Wow, that sucks for anyone who bought a 2011/12. You are right that will make the values drop a bit."

I don't think it was ""love.""

That's awful.

What does the rear look like? The current toyota rear lights are better than the jukebox previous version, but still look odd to my eye. Sort of like the new VW Beetle mess."
41,2012-07-19T21:47:34+00:00,fintail,"I think National has the best overall fleet of a major carrier, miles tend to be low and some cars are good spec. Sometimes works well in locations where they share with Alamo too - you can talk your way into going to the National side.

They even made a website for the Avalon...I read they bought 5000 of them. They'll all hit the market at once."
42,2012-07-19T22:54:05+00:00,tjc78,Limited models too. Toyota must have had to use up a lot of parts.
43,2012-07-20T01:35:10+00:00,fintail,Maybe they were afraid everyone would be holding out for the oh so pretty new model :shades:
44,2012-07-20T01:36:11+00:00,explorerx4,"A yellow Boss 302. It listed for about 46k with upgraded seats and a car cover/other stuff option. Also has a 5k markup from MSRP.
It was my dream car in high school."
45,2012-07-20T01:54:58+00:00,stickguy,"stopped at the Dodge/Jeep dealer (so the wife could check out a JGC). Did not have one inside, but they did have a Dart (red rallye, no roof).

nice looking, but would not pick that color. Did love the shifter, and the huge knob. pretty roomy. Dash was interesting, but a bit busy. not sure about the seats, looked nice, but a bit oddly stuffed. but as usual, not enough front tilt (would absolutely have to have a power seat if offered).

Nice car though, should do well, but for me, reminds me of the cell phone commercial with the German dude in the little bathing suit (""that car is for a younger person, wouldn't you say?"""
46,2012-07-20T01:59:35+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Checked the Internet and sure enough that was what I saw. At first I thought it was a new Dart but it was too big. Then I thought it was an new Hyundai, then I thought it was a new Fusion.

I only caught a glimpse of the front end, not enough to judge. But it was the tail that identified it as the new Avy.

47,2012-07-20T02:04:00+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Couple of new CX-5's, a revised Venza and a Subaru BR-Z.

Also a funny encounter on the highway with a new Saab 9-5 chasing down a Caddy STS. Must've been doing over 100mph (Ignorant clowns) and the Saab eventually passed and left the Caddy in the dust. Wasn't even close, the guy in the Caddy floored it after being passed but it's acceleration was far weaker than the 9-5. I'm thinking it was the V6 model, not a Northie."
48,2012-07-20T04:16:46+00:00,lemko,"Yeah, those new Avalon shoppers are like contestants on Let's Make a Deal who held out for what was behind door number three and got zonked!"

I can believe the female brand thing, but I will stop there :shades:

At one time anyway, weren't all Pathfinders AWD? Will this one be? I don't see the Xterra as more fit for legitimate off (paved) road use. A co-worker of mine has an older 2WD model, it's a pretty ridiculous guzzling high wagon - but she likes it for the seating position."
1,2012-07-31T17:49:22+00:00,ateixeira,"Funny thing is I think the new Pathfinder will sell to younger moms with kids.

Murano to older moms, maybe kids at high school age or even empty nest moms.

I never understood the appeal of a RWD only SUV."
2,2012-07-31T17:53:49+00:00,fintail,"The old one didn't sell to them, why would the new one? Young moms with small kids seem to like the hilariously named Rogue.

I don't see the legitimate appeal of most of the entire segment."
3,2012-07-31T17:59:17+00:00,ateixeira,"The old one was boxy, stiff riding, guzzled gas, and had a bolt-upright 3rd row. It missed when it came to all the family-friendly criteria.

Nissan seems to have addressed all those complaints.

This is a better minivan than the Quest."
4,2012-07-31T18:01:48+00:00,fintail,"So it was a real SUV, and not a dressed up minivan. I don't see it being a hit past the initial hype phase. Very competitive market.

Being better than a Quest doesn't take much. It loses points on looks alone."
5,2012-07-31T18:09:10+00:00,ateixeira,"Well, the Murano was outselling the Pathfinder about 2 to 1 (4,829 to 2,462 12/2011). Pilot humiliates both - 11,641 sales in December 2011.

You can stow away the 3rd row, if it even is standard, and it's a less garish Murano with a much bigger cargo area. It has more universal appeal.

I would not be surprised to see Nissan reverse that, and sell more Pathfinders than Muranos. The interior looks very comfy.

The Quest's is plush, but the boxy rear and minivan stigma have hurt it.

Nissan/Infiniti hadn't has a single car-like crossover with 3 rows. The JX got a good start and the Pathy will do even better.

This is what the market (I know, not you) wants.

Edit: JX was already selling at rates similar to the old Pathfinder, and it costs more."
6,2012-07-31T18:25:36+00:00,fintail,"To be fair, the Pathfinder was/is getting to be ancient - Murano is newer (and so ugly compared to the relatively clean first one) and JX is still in the new hype phase. I don't see this new glorified minivan doing especially well. The nameplate will mean something predetermined, and old customers won't like it.

I see the Pilot as a size larger than either, and not in direct competition. It's like a sensibly sized Armada."
7,2012-07-31T18:34:45+00:00,ateixeira,"JX was in its very first month of sales, though. Let's see July, but I bet production has not ramped up yet. 0 sales in May and about 2400 in June, so I'm guessing it could break 3k in July.

And that's the expensive twin.

Nissan has tons of Altima owners with kids who want to move up in space/size. If they don't fumble the launch I think Pathfinder sales could easily triple.

This segment is huge and continues to expand. I really think this will be a hit for them. Comfort, space, high seating position, 3rd row, huge cargo hold, reasonable MPG, tons of tech available, ease of use, image, etc.

I have friends with an MDX who have been waiting for something with a little more space, plus something that runs on regular fuel, and less of it. This fits their needs perfectly."
8,2012-07-31T18:46:32+00:00,fintail,"I guess we will have to see. I haven't heard of waiting lists for the JX, and I've seen a few on the road, so they are getting out there. But first year sales stats are not the most accurate - a 3 year or so average tells a better story - and neither of us care for the car enough to want to watch that :shades:

I know 2 people who have Pathfinders - one single, one married with no kids and no plans for them. I have always thought the model kind of has that image - not a family car.

You do list a couple important things - image, seating position. That sells.

MDX, the new definition of overpriced beige, takes premium? That's ridiculous."
9,2012-07-31T18:52:00+00:00,robr2,"This segment is huge and continues to expand. I really think this will be a hit for them. Comfort, space, high seating position, 3rd row, huge cargo hold, reasonable MPG, tons of tech available, ease of use, image, etc.

And I'm one that joined them when I bought my Explorer last year.

Look at the numbers through June:

Explorer 75K
Pilot 65K
Enclave 28K
Equinox 112K
Acadia 42K
Highlander 57K

That's 400K units sold so far this year and Nissan hasn't had anything to compete with in the 3 row CUV category. Current Pathfinder is at about 15K. I figure the new model will sell about 50K units annually."
10,2012-07-31T19:01:49+00:00,robr2,"I know 2 people who have Pathfinders - one single, one married with no kids and no plans for them. I have always thought the model kind of has that image - not a family car.

But as you can see based on the sales numbers, there aren't enough of those folks to support the Pathfinder as a true off roader. It's only real competition in the 4Runner and Toyota has only sold 22K of those this year.

The 2 people you know will happily move into the 4Runner or an Outback it they aren't hard core 4 wheelers."
11,2012-07-31T19:14:30+00:00,ateixeira,"MDX actually performs, though. Rare to see one that does."
12,2012-07-31T19:17:19+00:00,ateixeira,"You could even merge Enclave/Acadia sales, maybe even Traverse.

It is a volume segment and massively profitable, I'm sure. These are $40k transactions, often more.

Nissan wants a piece of that pie. Pathfinder had been MIA on the sales leaders chart."
13,2012-07-31T20:12:54+00:00,berri,"I think Nissan needs to rework the Rogue also. As gas prices bounce up and down, so does the mid size versus small CRV size market share. The Rogue seems too small in most ways to all of the more recent movers in this category. As for the new Pathfinder; I'll have to see it, but I think if gas stays reasonable it has a good chance for success. The one vehicle I don't see a lot of deals advertised for is the Explorer. I'd guess they were trying to balance supply and demand, except I've seen a number of them in the rental fleets at the airports."
14,2012-07-31T20:44:27+00:00,ateixeira,"With Juke that means Nissan has four crossovers. XS, S, M, and now L."
15,2012-07-31T21:19:51+00:00,fintail,"Nissan also dumps a bit into fleets - I have seen rental Pathfinder and Rogue, and most Quest I see here are rental.

Pathfinder just makes me wonder, as it has an image for being a kind of old fashioned/non cosseting SUV with no real prestige - will the suburban poser crowd want it when it goes soft and gets an extra row?

I wonder if real SUVs will exist in a few years."
16,2012-07-31T21:20:52+00:00,fintail,"I usually see them performing in a mall parking lot at 5mph with a frazzled housewife and inept middle manager in the front seats, and spoiled devilspawn in the back :shades:"
17,2012-08-01T02:10:07+00:00,berri,"I think crossovers have already won that war - better ride, comfort and mileage in an AWD wrapper. As for the Juke, I think its a joke. I expect that anime styling stuff to have a rather short shelf life and if I owned one I'd be trading it before the party is over."
18,2012-08-01T02:19:47+00:00,berri,"I agree that Nissan dumps a lot into fleets. As for the new Explorer, I've driven several rentals, but really can't make my mind up on this one yet. I think I like the GM Lambda's better, but I'm scared off of them given all of the negative blogs about them on the web."
19,2012-08-01T15:43:12+00:00,ateixeira,"Don't hold back to spare any feelings.

Same demographic drives the Cayenne, X6, etc."
20,2012-08-01T15:47:03+00:00,ateixeira,"fin may have a point about dropping the Pathfinder name and heritage.

Also, a buddy pointed out that it will lose sales in developing countries as it is no longer off road capable.

I guess Ghosn's bean counters did the math and more crossovers sales here would offset all of that.

They could have simply grown the Murano and built an extended wheelbase XTerra instead, to keep the name alive.

While visiting Suriname and Belize, I did see quite a few Pathfinders actually being used as intended."
21,2012-08-01T16:46:33+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a new one this morning, then just read that the turbo was rated 20/31mpg.

That seems pretty poor for a compact sedan. Even Buick's own Regal turbo does better. The bigger Optima turbo beats both.

I hope the added insulation is noticeable."
22,2012-08-01T16:47:49+00:00,robr2,"Well since it's still made in Spain for the ROW, it'll probably continue on."
23,2012-08-01T18:46:03+00:00,ateixeira,"In July.

9,724 so far. Let's see if the new Pathfinder hurts it.

It is now their 2nd best selling model, after the G sedan."
24,2012-08-01T21:34:39+00:00,fintail,"And what a laudable demographic it is, just as lovable as those vehicles.

Must be something going on in an adjacent office building at work today - gobs of freshly plated rental fodder hanging around - almost all Malibu and Mazda 6. Co-worker was in a fender bender and has a new Corolla for a rental - which he loathes. And his normal car is a 10 year old Altima with 120K on it."
25,2012-08-02T01:58:23+00:00,fintail,"I wonder where the sales are coming from. MDX? Armada? Murano? I sincerely doubt it is Altima drivers moving up, as the thing costs twice as much, and most of the nation isn't receiving sketchy beltway salaries :shades:"

I wouldn't expect much for the price. Funny how Elantra transactions prices are several thousand dollars higher on average. Remember when it used to be the other way around?"
27,2012-08-02T13:37:35+00:00,ateixeira,"Remember those? Not new, but rare, especially now.

Also saw a CX5 on the beltway.

Then a strange one - a new SLK, but with a shiny brushed metal mirror housing. The car itself was gray so it really clashed.

At least it wasn't chrome."
28,2012-08-03T01:48:07+00:00,fintail,"And they look and apparently drive like they cost less than a McDonalds meal, too. A car for people who hate cars. Elantra is now much newer and more developed, worth a couple grand more anyway. The guy stuck in it was complaining that it engine brakes too much at highway speed - must be that archaic transmission.

Saw a white R8 Cabrio today, dare ask how it was purchased."
29,2012-08-03T15:21:25+00:00,ateixeira,"My brother has a Brazil-spec Corolla. To a passenger, it's comfortable and quiet. No complaints really.

Not at all an enthusiast's car, but not meant to be.

I am sure Toyota knows well enough to keep the Corolla slathered in beige numbness.

Saw another new RX with the 61 Plymouth-Alien grille today, and that white Scion Freeze that a local lot was trying to flip is still sitting there, now covered in dust. Warms my heart.

And yeah, the problems at the 'Ring have to do with speculative commercial development when some wanted to make it into a full blown theme park with a mall and everything. Money and sense fail to meet yet again."
33,2012-08-05T01:41:50+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Caddy XTS today, parked at the dealer. Won't scare the Germans, but IMHO looks a lot sharper than the old DTS."
34,2012-08-06T14:09:07+00:00,ateixeira,"Corolla sells to young admin assistants around here.

They're cheap, run forever, and hold their value. Cost of operation is about as low as you can get, in fact I bet it costs less to own than most B segment cars.

It used to compete with the Civic by itself, but I think the Elantra has made a lot of shopping lists so they're willing to take a little more risk this time.

To be honest, I think for the most part they will simply try to style it slightly more aggressively and leave the mechanicals mostly intact, maybe a 5EAT or CVT auto.

In other words, I don't think it will take nearly as many risks as they say it will."
35,2012-08-06T14:11:42+00:00,ateixeira,"I like the XTS also. The huge wide screen is eye candy, too.

Pricing is ambitious but I bet these are a CPO bargain in a couple of years.

Saw a lot of new SRXs driving around this weekend. New Camaro RS parked in the condo across the way, also.

Also seeing plenty of new RDXs, I think it's selling at a much quicker pace than the outgoing one."

Per the thread title, I have now seen one of these in the flesh. I was working at a tradeshow over the weekend and Nissan brought one in a dark blue color to show off. It is bigger than the previous one for sure, and much roomier inside. The width is noticeable, especially vs the last one but given that the Pilot is as wide as a full size truck, it probably won't be much of an issue for most buyers.

41,2012-08-06T20:14:48+00:00,fintail,"Corolla sells to everyone here: new drivers, boring middle aged people, old people, new residents with no motoring experience (and drive like it). Running costs better be low, as running enjoyment is also low. My mother had one once (falling into the boring old people category), when I recommended a Camry to her after the Corolla got smashed, she thanked me as it was so much more car for not a fortune more money.

I think Corolla has enough cradle to grave clientele to survive no matter what happens."
42,2012-08-06T20:15:54+00:00,fintail,"I wouldn't buy any of them new, so it doesn't matter to me. If XTS depreciates like DTS, it will be a steal in a couple years.

I'm a little disappointed, but I guess is was my fault as I let it go a few thousand miles more than I should have. So 106 thousand miles, I needed a new pulse...

Still, waiting for AAA to show up to give me a jump start gave me some time for some spotting:

New CLS
(2) new E-class Cabrios
bunch of new X3's, Explorers, and Audi Q5's.
A slew of new Imprezas, CR-V's and new Camrys
(2) new Escapes
(3) new Mazda CX-5's
New, updated Porsche Boxster
Maserati Quattroporte
Honda Ridgeline Sport
A carrier full of new Fiat Darts
Carrier full of VW Tiguans, Passats and a yellow Toureg hangin off the back.

And lastly, I was pulling out of the station as a Fire truck was showing up to take care of the lady next to me with a dripping fuel tank in her Chevy Traverse. Too bad she didn't figure it out till after she pumped 5 gallons of fuel in the tank before I let her know there might be a problem when a puddle was forming underneath...

Amazing how the other folks around me paid no attention to the smell when she pulled in... :lemon:"

Lastly, I saw a red RR Evoque which is beautiful but that rear visibility must be the worst of any vehicle ever made.

Oh ya and speaking of rear visibility, anyone ever see the size of the rear wiper on the CT200h? It's so tiny and barely cleans 50% of the rear window, due to the squashed rear window which limits the swing radius."

I looked at the Quest when it came out - interior is nice, but the cargo area is about 10"" shorter than the competition, and 3rd row folds forward, which is a bit odd.

I'm not a fan of the exterior styling, but with an $8k or so advantage I'd have to look at one."
21,2012-08-10T19:49:38+00:00,stever,"The shortness doesn't bother me (actually that could be a plus), but I miss the days when you could get a base Caravan or Voyager that leaned more toward cargo than people hauling. We didn't get a Sienna in '98 because it was too plush and we knew we'd trash it. We use the big empty in the Quest all the time, but rarely have any passengers.

We need a C-Max ""shooting brake"" with a folding jump seat and lots of flat floor."

Ford kinda botched the launch (again) but once again they have an interesting product. I wonder how sales will compare to the old one, which relied on low prices and fleet sales?

Also saw my first Elantra GT in the flesh, loaded to the gills, panoramic moonroof and all. Those sticker for $24something, so not bad given the content level."

I think Ford is relying on higher prices overall to drive a higher profit margin even with incentives."
43,2012-08-20T20:06:50+00:00,berri,"I looked at the new Escape. I thought it looked nice, but 2-3 G's over a loaded CRV, I don't think so: less room, less comfortable leather seating, and didn't seem to really have that much difference in zoom. I believe Ford and GM are stepping on it with their pricing vice Honda, Toyota, Nissan, etc. If you comparison shop, either they'll have to throw a lot of promotional bucks once the vehicle has been out a bit, or settle for lower volume. Personally, I'm very disappointed that D3 didn't get more aggressive and competitive while they had the opportunity. With all of the new transplants and their vendor systems, I don't think there will be another bailout for them if they don't get it right."
44,2012-08-20T21:36:56+00:00,fintail,"I think they are both kind of too big. Neither are anything I want to buy though - new or use, so I guess it's no matter. The tall SLK nose makes it easy to distinguish, but the detailing on the 2013 model is indeed very close to the 2012."

I drove the new CRV my parents just got. IMHO, it was OK. It's a perfectly fine vehicle but it didn't make any kind of impression on me. The styling is a little funky - every time I see one I think of Marvin the Martian. At least the new Escape has some appealing styling."

of course, her #1 choice is the Acura version of the CRV (an RDX), so I think she is just badge snobbing here!"
1,2012-08-23T15:06:30+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Having driven both, I would say that the RDX is a pretty significant upgrade over the CRV. The V6 alone is worth the upgrade, especially when it gets some of the highest mileage in its class. I also found the visibility to be a little better on the Acura as well, the high rear window on the CRV kind of impedes on outward visibility.

On a side note, and perfectly related to this topic, my wife and I checked out the new BMW X1 last night. This one was the 4-cyl Turbo and was pretty well loaded. It was pretty small, actually reminded me of the Infiniti EX35 in that it was more like a 1 series wagon than an SUV. I bet the ground clearance couldn't be more than a Subaru Impreza at around 6 inches. But the sticker was over 39 grand! Yikes.

I mean, not that it wasn't a nice car but compared to it's bigger brother the X3 and the more spacious Acura RDX, it seemed a bit much... The big pano roof was a nice touch tho and man, 33mpg highway is outstanding.

I still think the RDX is a compelling package, and for the price, features and certainly the mileage (20/27mpg with AWD), I think Acura nailed the segment."

Will have to price one out once I retire. Good car to get back and forth from the beach when it's just the two of us. I'll be ready for something less sporty and more grand tourer."
22,2012-08-24T15:38:08+00:00,fintail,"They need to do so on more cars. Late model E63 weighs like 600lbs more than my E55 - sure, it is more powerful, but the weight isn't good no less.

A used SL can be tempting for some , as it seems they do sell to retirement aged people as a boulevardier. Most mint late 90s-early 00s models I see are driven by older men."

The '03 had a lot less miles.

I bet soon there will be dozens.

I'd be a bit afraid of a $9000 bill for a new top mechanism (how reliable/durable are those anyway?). I think this is the type of car you'd have to set aside a nice reserve for repairs."
26,2012-08-24T18:12:05+00:00,fintail,"The tops are better than the air suspension - on an 03 or 04 especially, that is more likely to break. I wouldn't touch one of those cars."

That whole body style sort of leans forward too much for my tastes. The prior one aged better even though it's very conservative.

03+ models have airmatic. It seems to be a lot less troublesome after 06. I'm pretty sure the new one has it.

It's too much of a car for women with stretched back eyes, for me...S65 would be the only way to go, and maintenance on that has to be like restoring a castle."

I explained to her that you have to shift at over 5000rpm to squeeze more power out of it. We switched seats and I showed her how to drive it properly. She was impressed but it was a bit too much for her."

No replacement for displacement.

I think fewer and fewer cars will offer that given the CAFE pressures.

Even AMG engines are getting smaller and relying on forced induction. They can beat the performance but it'll never feel as linear."

Not new, but I am close to pulling the trigger on a used 06 Honda Ridgeline. Took her for a spin and drove pretty good for a truck with 212 thousand miles on it... :shades: I figure it will make a nice Home Depot hauler. No rust, some wear, but overall she's a peach.

The tC actually had a decent sized engine for its class, at 2.4l. It, the VW Golf 2.5l, and the Subaru Impreza were often cited for offering good torque for a class not generally known for it.

Thing is, Scion stood still and the world around them progressed. Now it's just an average-powered shadow of the FR-S."

My wife owned a 626 so I was in the Mazda threads during that period, and every other day a CD4E would fail. The 4 banger auto was the only model that got that trans, the V6 got a better one and those never had issues. Ours was a manual so also no issues with the trans.

While that car was fun (V6 manual) we had 5 issues in a 2 year period and service was expensive so she replaced it with a Subaru. The Subie was much better in that regard.

You switched to Mitsubishi, right? The Galant?

My Miatas have been much better than that 626."

The 626 only shared that dreaded CD4E transmission, ironically.

Both had 2.5l V6 engines but they were different. Mazda used their own KL V6 series.

Ford used the Duratec. It's odd because of the similar size and output.

I test drove a V6/manual Contour, but the 626 had a better back seat for the kids, and the engine was smoother as well.

To be honest, today, on paper at least, I'd pick a Fusion over this elongated 6."

Yeah. When the Mazda had 107K miles on the clock I gave it to my sister. I picked up a '99 Galant with Mitsu's then-195HP 3L V6. Had it for a near-perfect 152K miles/10.5 years. The reliability was better than any other car I'd ever owned (includes Mazda, Toyota, Nissan, Mercury to go back to about 1985) so I replaced the Galant with an AWD 2010 Outlander GT with the current 230HP 3L V6.

When I've been on the market I've looked at Subarus but for various reasons they've not made the short list.

I admit I haven't owned or driven every brand. Financially it makes sense to own a vehicle for as long as you can and for as long as it's reliable enough that the cost of maintenance & repairs doesn't exceed the cost of replacement.

I do still see an MX-3 around here once in a while. It isn't in great shape but considering it's probably at least 17 years old, I doubt the owner can complain.

Hmm. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_MX-3 shows a 120MPH top speed in the MX-3 V6. Hit 113 on the Illinois Tri-state tollway once; didn't try to go faster than that. I've only had the Outlander to 97 so far."
40,2012-08-30T17:49:09+00:00,ateixeira,"Wifey's Subaru was good enough that she has another also. She won't even talk about trading this one.

Our salesman jokes he sees Subaru buyers only once every 7 years. To get a new one.

She had a Mitsubishi Mirage prior to the 626. It was not bad, a few issues but decent car. No power steering so I had to reach over and help turn that wheel!

The 626 was good for the first 5 years, then fell apart.

Her Legacy cost us $0 in repairs over more than 7 years. She saved up enough money for a down payment on a condo we now own. Life is good. :shades:"

My car from that era was a '91 Ford Escort GT. It was the first year of that platform and got the 1.8l DOHC engine shared with Mazda, later used in the NB Miata.

Great bang for the buck at less than $11k. A Civic Si or Sentra SE-R were closer to $14k at the time. NX2000 with a T-top was another price level above those.

The nose was dorky but that's what I wanted at the time. 140hp back then was a lot for a pocket rocket."
43,2012-08-30T19:48:13+00:00,fushigi,"Funny you mention the NX2000. That was the other car I was interested in at the time. The major advantage to the Nissan was it had ABS available while the MX-3 did not. Despite no ABS, the MX-3 stopped in very short distances due to being lightweight and having oversized discs (12.4"" up front).

From a functional standpoint, and IIRC price as well, the MX-3 was the better vehicle for me. It was also the first car I ever bought new."
44,2012-08-30T20:01:33+00:00,ateixeira,For me the MX3's back seat was small. I might have considered the 323 if it came with a better engine at the time. The GTX model was gone by '91.

Like the Voyager, a sliding door came on some but not all of them, but not the one we looked at. Could even get them with manuals back then. Didn't look at them again in '99 when they were all FWD and dual sliders.

What I really wanted back in the day was a Previa, but couldn't afford one."

When the Previa came along, we had been in the Voyager for a couple of years, had a 7/70 powertrain warranty, and it had worked well on a road trip. Couldn't see trading that soon and the trade-in value on the $13k van wouldn't have put much of a dent in the Previa's price (seems like it was $20k or more?). Should have tossed the Tercel in the mix and gone back to one car though.

The MPVs did have a good rep for reliability."
12,2012-09-04T16:33:15+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Friend of mine brought his new BR-Z to a cookout over the weekend so I got to check it out. Got it in the classic Subie ""Mica Blue"" color. Didn't get a chance to drive it though as he was busy with his kids all afternoon

Also checked out a BMW X1 with the 3.5 that the local dealer had on the lot. This one was pretty well loaded and had a sticker of just over 44 grand. Compared it to an X3 which was 4 grand more and it would be a tough call on whether I would just spend the extra few grand to move up a size. Oh how I wish I could get the X1 with a stick...

Also looked at a Z4 35i with a sticker over 61 grand!!! :surprise:

lastly, on the way out, I stopped behind a current generation Impala which came out in what 2007? What I found odd was the good size bubble of rust that was peaking out over that chrome strip on the trunk lid where it meets the bumper. Had residue leaking down the chrome and everything. I always thought GM did a pretty good job of rust prevention (cars at least, not so much on trucks...) but it was awkward to see on a newer car like that."
13,2012-09-04T17:56:27+00:00,fintail,"I still see Previas now and then - Toyotas were overengineered at that time. I think they were seen as a premium product, hence the price - especially for S/C or AWD models.

Not seeing many old style MPVs anymore."

still, of the options if you want a full-size minivan (oxymoron?), it is still probably the best one. The new Sienna is kind of weird (no clue how it drives) and the Quest is hideous. So, Honda it is, unless you want to save money and go Chrysler instead."
19,2012-09-05T13:30:44+00:00,ateixeira,"I like the Ody minus the odd ball styling and the fact that you have to spend $40k plus to get the 6 speed automatic.

The new Sienna suffered cost cutting. The 8th seat is smaller than on my 2007, and plastics aren't as nice. I'd still drive one.

Dodge made improvements to the interior but IMHO it only went half way. I'd like to see a clean-sheet effort.

VW is a Dodge clone. Even worse, I saw one that had alloys on the Monroney and it clearly had plastic wheel covers over steel wheels. Nice quality control, VW.

Nissan's van has a 10"" shorter cargo area. You buy a van for the space so that's a big sacrifice. Huge incentives would make it a budget buy, I suppose, you can get a well equipped leather model under $28k.

Not sure, if mine were totalled, I may go looking for a CPO 2010 Sienna, pre-cost cutting."

It is the only model without a long running history of mechanical issues, especially in the transmission department. It has issues with the power sliders, but they all do.

I can relate - had to squeeze 2 bikes in my Sienna this weekend. It was tight with cargo as well, so those 3"" would have made it a chore.

I actually ended up ordering a bike rack this morning. It can hold up to 3 bikes and I can fit 1-2 inside, so we can all go riding."

30,2012-09-05T17:34:18+00:00,tifighter,"You wouldn't believe the cargo area measurements I have for various vehicles. I should start a website.

Nissan keeps making a point of the cargo floor being level with the bumper for easier loading as a selling point, and it probably makes a great diaper changing station. I think they raised the covered cargo bins to be level with the seat mechanism and lost some height in the process.

Of course, I could just remove the lids from said bins and drop the front wheel in there, giving back some of the height I need. That would probably work."

But even on my SWB Voyager minivan I could roll two bikes in (it was a 5 seater and I often stashed the 2nd row seat in the shed).

Guess not enough of us buy minivans for easy cargo access instead of for hauling people."

It's funny, some people talk about compromise but it's the opposite - you DON'T compromise. All the people and all the cargo can fit, and that's the whole point.

35,2012-09-05T18:01:58+00:00,tifighter,"I agree here fully, the whole point of the minivan is no compromise. Actually, the compromise is that you are driving a genre of vehicle that everyone likes to make fun of, but it is all about function first to me. Were Toyota to offer a spare tire/lose the runflats on the AWD Sienna, I'd buy one for the ultimate cycling and skiing car. And I don't even have kids."

The mainstream models look great and do show positive signs of Honda waking up in the design dept.

Also, be assured that if this model was nothing more than the conventional model with a hybrid powertrain, we'd be reading about how dull and uninspiring (""boring"" in anti-import spoeak) it is. So at least they are taking a few risks this time around."

35,2012-09-14T22:21:25+00:00,robr2,"(possible rental - out of state plates and no frames)

I've seen you mention no frames as a sign of a possible rental. Do most folks out in Seattle keep those awful dealer plate frames on?

Here in MA, the RMV started cracking down on plate frames. During the annual inspection, plate frames that obscured any part of the plate - including the state logo - were removed. In reality they broke them off. So no plate frame really doesn't mean anything here."
36,2012-09-14T23:24:22+00:00,fintail,"Yes, in WA , the vast majority of later model cars wear dealer plate frames. Most people either can't be bothered to remove them, or maybe want to show off where the car was purchased. The registration stickers are located so a frame can't really obscure them. No inspections in this region either.

On the same subject, combined with no plate frames, barcodes are the easiest giveaway, as gated communities who use similar are virtually unknown in this part of the country, and from what I can see, the gate opener stickers are different looking anyway."

Two Cruzes, a Sonic and (all of these plus various Impalas were spotted around Saginaw) and a Forte. Also thought I had stumbled onto a manufacturer review event at Tahquamenon Falls SP when I spotted 10 new looking Dodge Rams lined up by themselves in a section of parking lot, all side by side. Upon closer inspection, there were a couple of Fords mixed in.

I did get a lot of seat time in my brother's newish 2012 F-150 when we met them at Traverse City for some camping earlier in the week. Nice rig, lots of bells and whistles. Climbing in and out (even with the running boards) got to be a bit of a chore, especially after the 4th or 5th winery tour. The topside of the bed rails is about even with my shoulder. The beds on these things have gotten so high, I don't know how anyone gets stuff in them.

Escape.

X3 - these are abundant, the official lux crossover of the state.

CX5.

Here's how you give direction in NE:

OK, so you drive up that way, make a left at the 3rd Subaru dealer. Then drive up and make a right between the 4th and 5th Subaru dealers, then another right at the 3rd Subaru dealer, and you've arrived."

Comfortable and quiet. Handles like a car, looks good, only downside seems to be the small cargo area. If you can live with that, it seems like a solid choice.

Yesterday's rental was a Traverse. Which was funny as I originally reserved a compact."

Saw that VW van again, Touran TDI. Diplomatic plates. Wonder how well it runs on USLSD?

Would make sense, though, with partial owner Toyota focusing on hybrids, to let Subaru do diesels so they don't cannibalize each other.

12 hours behind the wheel with an instructor
6 hours of backseat observation
40 hours of driving time with a parent or guardian or 30 hours if the student takes a skills course
2 hour parent education class."

I doubt I practiced for 30 or 40 hours, but I mostly did it in vintage cars, so maybe 1 of those hours = 3 in a normal car.

I looked online - local schools seem to charge around $800-1000 for any real time. Inflation and no subsidies I suppose.

The illustrations for the book were photos of scale models showing different driving scenarios. The car that indicated the driver's car in the models was a yellow Matchbox fintail Mercedes.
39,2012-09-28T13:58:30+00:00,lemko,"I learned to drive in my Dad's 1978 Ford Granada and it was tougher than any driving school. Everytime I screwed up, Dad would give me a nice solid punch in the right shoulder! My first time out was in the driving rain. Dad reasoned if I could handle driving in poor conditions, I could do well in better weather. One of our early times out, he had me go up this steep mountain road with tight hairpins curves! He set up a slalom course in a factory parking lot and had me drive through it in reverse! Well, I DID pass my driver's test the first time!"

Nice looking hatch. Gotta have the panoramic moonroof on that one."
41,2012-09-28T15:12:17+00:00,fintail,"Sounds cool. I remember the drivers ed ""training"" films we had to endure were mostly vintage - in the early 90s my school was using stuff made in the late 60s-early 70s (and the ""simulators"" were of similar vintage). I paid more attention to the street scenes than the actual driving simulation."
42,2012-09-28T15:19:12+00:00,ateixeira,"Ever learn the trick to keep your foot on the brake the whole time?

IIRC we were allowed up to 3 mistakes and if you did that you were pretty much golden. The ""film"" had one green light where you were supposed to let off the brakes and hit the gas, but you could even ignore that and pass.

The quality of instruction is so poor. Kids can parallel park (for a week, then they forget), but they can't control a skid and don't know what to do when they hydroplane or get a flat tire."
43,2012-09-28T15:23:12+00:00,fintail,"I don't have many specific memories...I do remember the speed minder part of the simulator was rarely on, as I often would see how high I could make the gauge read. It took forever past 60.

I vaguely remember discussion about flat tires, and snow driving, but none of it was actually demonstrated on the road. I think one of the assignments was to change a tire at home. On the other side, when my dad would teach me, he was more concerned about parking and in town driving, too. However, when I was younger, he would show me cornering lines and tell me when one should brake or accelerate."
44,2012-09-28T15:26:12+00:00,ateixeira,"I'd floor it all the time, almost pinned the speedo. They didn't check speed limits, it was funny.

I was learning stick and best advice came from a friend. Always start in 1st, take 90 degree corners in 2nd, and highway exit ramps in 3rd.

Simple rule of thumb for stick drivers that driver's Ed never covered, and I took a whole semester of it, August to December!"

Sergio complained about VW offering big incentives now that VW has deeper pockets than the struggling Italians, and that started a huge war of words. They're supposed to have a ""sit down"" today, LOL.

Careful, Piech, you have a big ego but the dude's Italian. Don't bring a knife to a gun fight."
46,2012-09-28T16:17:38+00:00,fintail,"No discussion at all of manuals when I took drivers ed. Another one left to my dad - and as the manual car in the family by the time I was driving was a 68 Ford with a 3 on the tree and power assists for nothing, I didn't like it anyway.

In VW vs Fiat, I'd bet on VW."
47,2012-09-28T16:29:41+00:00,ateixeira,"Even less reason now, given so few MTs are available.

Marcionne is stronger but Piech's ego alone will knock him out. Remember he thought the Phaeton could take Mercedes.

VW has deeper pockets for sure.

Sergio's right, though. VW is dumping HUGE incentives at a time when Fiat is most vulnerable.

Very opportunistic."

Winchester police have one as does the Mass General Hospital police force. My town got a Caprice PPV. It looks small next to the Crown Vics.

I drove an XLR at a Taste of Lexus event, ironically. I remember lots of hard vinyl surfaces, built to last rather than look or feel good. Not elegant for what it is, but should at least be durable.

That event was a hoot, they had cars from many brands available to compare. Even a hill for the Land Cruisers to climb.

Now that the market's back up, hopefully automakers start to host events like that again."

Of course, it was speeding - something like that suffers from ""lowfat"" mentality - like a low cal food, the tendency is to eat more of it.

First, nobody wants a mild hybrid. Everyone who has tried has failed.

Second, market them on contractors' pickups for their generator-like capabilities. Charge all your cordless drills, for instance.

The ads should focus on that. Not 20mpg, which isn't real world and wouldn't be that good even if it were!"
31,2012-10-11T13:56:22+00:00,fintail,"I bet jackrabbit starts and speeding in congested suburban areas makes that tank get well under 20mpg, too. I suspect the Escalade hybrid didn't have a huge production run."

I wouldn't even consider the hybrid model. I'm not even sure I'd consider the diesel, either. At that level just get the V8 and enjoy it for what it is and the noises it makes.

You gotta pay to play, if you care about gas mileage then why are you buying a performance SUV in the first place?

Replace the Panamera with the much better looking Sport Turismo and all is forgiven, Porsche. Ferdinand can RIP again."

I stopped by and checked them out. The C-Max is a tidy package which I think will be a great alternative to the Prius. It's not going to put the fear of God into Toyota but it might convert a few ""domestic only"" buyers. Plus it looks bigger than the Prius.

The Fusion was great. A couple of little things I noticed. The headliner is scooped out in front giving the folks up there more headroom. The console is influenced by Volvo - the front of it is accessible from behind the main waterfall. The mirrors are mounted on the door instead of up on the front door glass area. Lastly was the roof. Most vehicles have a rubber strip to cover the unfinished weld between the roof panel and the uni-body. The Fusion has a finished weld there. Does this make it better? I don't think so but it's one more piece of quality workmanship.

Also rear legroom was great. I adjusted the seat for my 5-11 and 32"" inseam and had plenty of room in the back."

Accent Hatchback - ""engaging style inside and out""

Elantra Touring - ""handsomely styled four-door sedan""

Hyundai Tucson - ""Sharp styling inside and out"" (""sharp styled"" was also used in a new Santa Fe Sport First Drive review; I suppose you could argue that ""sharp"" is a detriment.)

I disagree.

35mpg when it came out was best in class, but Camry matched it and Altima and Accord leap frogged it.

Yet in the 4th model year they just had a record month.

If that's not aging gracefully then I don't know what is.

Aging gracefully? I still haven't seen a credible positive analysis of Hyundai's overblown styling. It's just a cribbed down to a WalMart level CLS with high standard features and a good warranty. The latter two matter most.

Sales and good styling are not necessarily connected.

And on a lack of styling tangent, I saw an ILX today. For when an IS is just too dynamic and exciting."

On the car front, it was amazing the things that I spotted over there. The BMW's, Audi's and Mercs were as common as a Toyota or a Honda here in the states. They were the staples of the automotive landscape. VW's as well, not as prevailent, but still common. Heck I had a Toureg blow by me doing about a buck-50 on day 1 leaving Munich! This was the Autobahn afterall, there were plenty of places to ""open up"" and see what those babies could do.

And here's the kick. Driving the Autobahn was one of the greatest, and most relaxing roads I have ever driven. Everyone thinks it is going to be scary to be sharing the roads with these Tuetonic Bruisers doing twice your speed but if you just obey a few guidelines it can be very enjoyable. Don't pass on the inside, and if your going to pass, get over, pass and get back into the slower lanes if you want to keep pace. Give yourself plenty of notice where you need to turn and I highly recommend a Navi. Ours was a POC TomTom that kept screwing up, but thankfully the roads are so well marked it wasn't much of a problem (although the TomTom did send us to Switzerland when we wanted to go to Triberg/Frieberg, ugh :sick: )

As far as spotting, some of the unusal ones were a Weismann MF5 (which sounded downright incredible passing us on the Autobahn), an Aston DB5, Aston DB7, Mercedes SLS63, a couple of R8's, both V8 and V10, a sinister looking triple black S63, an Ascari, (A10?) A fleet of brand new, untagged 911's around Munich and a very weird BMW 3-series with camoflage hanging out in the back of a parking lot in Dinkelsbuhl covered in dust. :confuse: Somebody forget where they parked their concept car?

Off topic, but one thing I found interesting was for all the stories I hear about how unreliable German cars are, in the entire week I was there, I only saw 3 broken down cars, an older VW GTi and a pair of Opel Vectra wagons... I saw a lot more Citroens and Puegeots on the side of the road than German cars.

All in all a very amazing trip to an amazing place. Highly recommend if you haven't been."

One was actually one of those mulletmobile Camaro's, a very strange sighting in Bavaria... This one was brand new, SS with the Asian style ground effects and silver racing stripes down the middle. The new Camaro exhaust note sounds like crap btw, this one was no exception... Anyways, this guy was playing chase with an M3 and about 140mph or so, lost it in one of the tunnels. Not something I would want to try testing it's top speed on, that thing must've blew apart into a million pieces! Sadly, I don't think the driver made it eithier :surprise: but I didn't stick around ""rubbernecking"" (something that drives me nuts here in the states) as I drove by...

The second was coming back form a day trip to Cologne, and about 9PM at night, I got passed by a dude in a sport bike that had to be doing 180 -200mph. Seriously, this guy came up on me so fast, by the time I turned my head to see what it was, all I could see was a fading taillight.

Needless to say, about 10 minutes and maybe 20-30 km later, we came upon a scene with an Ambulance, some cops and a red sportbike lying across the highway with trails of fluids (bike, driver?) all over the place. Again, cannot imagine how that guy made it."

Driving there is a real adventure, sometimes a test, but is as fun as anything else on the trip. I remember seeing only one wreck, in traffic a CLK rear ended another car. Maybe the lack of phone yapping has a positive effect.

Last time I was near Stuttgart (Affalterbach), I saw a camo prototype ML out for testing, and last time I was in Munich I saw an ""efficient dynamics"" badged 7er out for testing at very high speeds on the 'bahn headed to Stuttgart. I also remember being passed by a M5 wagon that made me look like I was parked - and I was exceeding 100mph, in the rain no less.

Having nav is very important. Germany also has many towns with the same name - so make sure you select the right one. I remember going to the wrong Regensburg, I think it was.

Speaking of new models, Euro cars often hit the road a good 6-12 months before NA, so you can really see new ones there."

If you want a durable daily driver MB where you don't need to worry about roads and weather, seek an old W123 or W124.

Today's new sighting - pearl white-ish Lexus ES, I still laugh at the commercials featuring the stubble faced 30 something guy who in the real world wouldn't go near that car which actually is desired by people like my mother.

43,2012-10-29T00:48:15+00:00,berri,"I was driving around this weekend and saw some 2013's for the first time. Believe it or not, I just saw (or noticed) a new Altima even though I think they've been out for awhile. It was pulling out of a parking lot. What struck me was the seemingly disproportionately large front end. Maybe it was just the angle. Saw a new Lexus sedan with the spindle grill. Struck me as just as ugly as in the pictures. The most interesting was what appeared to be a Cadillac XTS. I don't know if they are out yet, but I was stopped behind a few vehicles for a funeral procession. Behind the hearse were two black Caddy's. One of them had the current angular edge styling and a six window greenhouse. I'm pretty sure it was a new XTS since it appeared too short to be a limo. Old cars included a mid seventies Nova. Looks large today, particularly with the elongated roof line they had at the end, even though it was a compact back then. Also saw a maybe 62 Ford Fairlane fake woody with nice chrome on it."
44,2012-10-29T00:54:14+00:00,fintail,"XTS has been out for maybe 8 weeks or so. I too saw an Altima and a new face RX, and a new GL (maybe the same I saw yesterday). Also a new CX-7,which seem to be popular here already, and another Infiniti JX."

Nothing remarkable except it was that neon green-gold color that's become popular recently and on a dreary grey, drizzly morning it made that car stand out as if was the only colored thing in a black-and-white world.

Hyundai deserves some credit for taking the most nondescript vehicle and turning it into a real looker. The only trouble is it's better looking than the more expensive Hyundais."

DC was not too bad. There was a downed tree about 150 yards from my house.

Ocean City is a mess, coastal highway was under water and one of the fishing piers (at least) was totally wiped out.

Our condo is 2nd floor so it should be OK, though I worry that our A/C unit may have been flooded. The place is winterized so I'm asking a neighbor to check it out.

NYC got it much worse than we did."

Saw another new Fusion as it blew by me on the Interstate. This one was silver. Liked the looks of it's grill in my review mirror, but as I see more of them the rest of the car is looking more Hyundai like to me. Still nice, but maybe not quite as exceptional as I initially thought. If it's priced right I think it will sell well."

Gotta say, in person, the Fusion is kind of disappointing. This one may have been rental grade but it just looked fat and heavy and the miniml wheel gaps made it look like a low rider...

Spent last weekend in Key West and on the way down, spotted a new ATS. It was the first one I have seen on the road.

Meh...

The XTS has much more presence, even tho it's nothing more than a Glammed up Lacrosse/Impala rental car."

C-Max is one of those that looks better in person than on paper. I wonder how real world mileage will be. They claim +7mpg over the Prius V, but other Ford hybrids make the same claims and real world mileage still doesn't match similar Toyotas (Fusion vs. previous TCH) per fuelly and fueleconomy.gov.

I hope it does because it's a pretty cool package. Not that I'm shopping, but that would make my short list to replace the minivan if it were stolen or something."

I am renting a car to drive down to Norfolk on business for a couple days (actually more convenient than flying, since the company won't spring the extra $$ for a non-stop flight!) from Philly. Was supposed to go Wednesday, but for obvious reasons (including the Hertz location at my local AAA not having power) it got postponed.

I swung through today to make sure they were back open (yes they were) and saw the little collection of cars in their part of the parking lot. Seemed to consist of a Versa (yuck) Corolla (yuck) and a Camry SE (last generation, didn't those redesign for 2013?).

I was hoping for something interesting (Mazda, even a new Malibu or fusion) but no such luck. I just hope that the Camry is what qualifies as the ""standard"" (full size?) or whatever it is I reserved. Because 5 hours in either of the other 2 could be painful."

Spotted a Q3 this morning (you can see the weather is just awesome)



Also saw an Audi A1 cabrio - uncommon even here, new Jag XJ diesel, late model lowline Landcruiser, all kinds of off small euros and a few small Asians, zero Prius, zero Lexus, and not new but a Citroen C6 - which is cool."

So, the most convenient location that was available on my corporate travel site. They seem to only have a couple on hand at a time, so I assume if they get a booking they might bring in a unit from some central place.

I ended up with a 2012 Malibu LT. 37K on it (Florida plates up in Jersey, so it has been around). Lot of miles for a rental, but insides seemed OK. Body a bit beat up (bumpers and so forth). Decently equipped, with XM radio at least, heated power seats, and even shiny chrome wheels (tacky, but shiny).

first time driving one of them. Drivers seat was actually pretty comfortable on the drive home. Lets see how it does after 5 hours!

I asked about the lone Camry, which I think was the new body style so probably a 2012 also. The guy said it wasn't ready yet, whatever that meant. But it also did not have sat radio, and since I am going to be driving through the boonies most of the way, that is a nice feature to have."

Also a new B-class (extra styling!) and a new A-class. I'm in Stuttgart now, so MB and Porsche are more common, and the car scene is active overall. Also saw a GT-R, which has to be uncommon here.

Finally saw a Lexus too. A debadged old IS sportcross, probably IS200. Not one Prius today. No big fat SUVs either, and pickups are for people who live on farms, and for construction work. What a world..."

http://parts.olathetoyota.com/2011-car-sales-statistics.html

Also, Toyota share of their own home market is much higher than VW's in Germany.

Better offense and better defense, home turfs.

VW makes it up in China and Brazil, though.

When I was a kid the 4 major names there were Fiat, Ford, VW, and Chevrolet. Toyota sold a few FJs here and there. They really have a lot of catching up to do, but Toyota is stubborn and prices their products WAY too high there."
39,2012-11-05T17:09:16+00:00,fintail,"The small models are accepted here. Many iQ and Yaris sized things. But anything bigger than a Corolla, forget about it.

Mistubishi seems to do well too, for the very small cars esp. Honda has some presence with the excellent Euro Civic. Have seen maybe one Subaru.

Japanese consumers are nationalistic to put it lightly, so those stats are not shocking.

Oh yeah, I saw a Brilliance on the road today. Several years ago the brand tried to launch in Europe, I believe it was a quick failure. The only local listings I can find are paired with Lada dealers and garages, so that explains something. Driver probably works for a Chinese embassy or dreams of sweatshops and opression."

The Subarus are all up in Scandinavia.

The Brilliance didn't implode on itself?

Lada tried in Brazil, offering uber-cheap cars, some less than half the cost of competitors. Didn't take long for them to rust in the sea air, and before long they were gone. And I mean LONG gone, you don't even see them any more."
41,2012-11-05T18:17:10+00:00,fintail,"Germany is very loyal for large cars. But normal and small cars are pretty open - even French cars are common. Subarus are very popular in Switzerland.

The later Brillance was engineered to pass safety tests...but I suspect few wanted to roll those dice.

Lada tried Canada, too. I think the only survivors are Niva/Cossack. The brand is still offered in Europe, I think, but finds few sales. The cheapskate set buys Dacia and small Koreans now."
42,2012-11-05T20:54:56+00:00,ateixeira,"Dacia Duster is sold in Brazil, but badged as a Renault.

You could say it basically took over the Niva's slot, in terms of being the cheapest little AWD you can get. Though it's more crossover, less SUV.

At least it doesn't rust when you stare at it like Ladas did."
43,2012-11-06T17:17:06+00:00,fintail,"I've seen a couple Dusters on the road. Actually, I watched a car show on TV last weeked, where they compared the (very very) base model to a loaded model, which cost more than twice the base car. Lots of differences.

I think the Lada Niva is fairly robust. I kind of like those things.

Had a good car sighting day - as I went on a tour of MB assembly facilities at Sindelfingen. These were all outside or driving - at least a dozen SLS cabrios and many normal SLS, maybe 10 CLS Shooting Brake, 5 or 6 B-Class F-cell,and the highlights were two thinly masked facelift (2014) E-class, and a heavily masked protoype C-class. Sadly, I was on a bus and they were long gone by the time my phone camera was ready. C-class was odd, lots of CLS DNA in it."
44,2012-11-06T17:19:56+00:00,ateixeira,"Samara was awful.

Niva was a decent little truck, but a very dated design. They should have at least switched to galvanized steel. The bodies just didn't last.

Keep in mind most of Brazil lives on the coast with salty air. Mom owned a Fiat Uno that had a rust hole go all the way through in less than 12 months (no kidding).

Cheap cars simply rust away."
45,2012-11-06T17:26:47+00:00,fintail,"They tried Samara in Canada, too. Up to maybe 1995. I bet all were off the road by 2000. Imagine how those held up in Ontario winters.

I am surprised I haven't seen a Lada yet here. Once you go to the old east, you still see Trabis and Wartburgs. I did see Romanian plates today.

Oh yeah, and one Prius and one Lexus - RX that was holding up traffic trying to find a nonexistant parking spot. Cultural universal..."

The paint feels delicate to me, I wonder how it will resist chips. Also there are endless tons of new A and B class on the road here, so they must be a hit.

Saw more cool things. too - on the bus on the way to the museum, saw 2 new S-class test mules being driven. One was completely disguised, the other had the greenhouse unmasked.

As for styling, Sorento reminds me of an MDX without any of the extraneous ""styling"". Not sure but I think it was designed before Schreyer's influence came in to play, yet it's aged well.

Can't really compare vehicles with such different pricing but Sorento does more than 3x the sales volume of the ML, and that was before the powertrain upgrades."

It just looks weird, and frankly, wrong. A shame too, as the Avalon has usually been easy enough to look at, for its blandness. Like some others, the Avalon was the Toyota sedan I would most consider driving.

How much more does a comparably equipped ILX cost vs Civic, esp now that I have read the 13 model will have improved finishes? It's not a cheap car, loading it up makes it compete with basic models of legitimate entry lux competitors. And I won't even get into parents who buy what is likely a teenager something that expensive.

There probably will be nice leases - unless something exciting about the car is shown, sales might not be hot. Lease one with little down and something like $249/month, maybe not bad."

Acura is up 27% this year, well ahead of the market.

ILX is overpriced, plus a Civic Si is nicer now so why even bother? They sold a couple thousand.

TSX is nice, especially the wagon. Can't get a manual + wagon combination, though, bummer.

TL's new, smaller beak was apparently enough to boost sales, and the crossovers are doing well.

MDX is their best seller despite its age. After seeing an X1 35i for $47k you can understand why people flock to this. It's certainly a better driver than an RX.

RDX is a hit, sales up 129%. I think people like that big V6 and all the content at this price point.

RL is OK, I guess the one distinguishing feature is the 16 LED lights, though they might look better in a gatlin-gun style arrangement a la Infiniti Q45."
28,2012-12-05T17:04:31+00:00,fintail,"Looking at the public, I will take that as a compliment :shades:

Acura is up via soft roader-estrogen mobile sales, no doubt. Anything in the lineup to make an enthusiast look? Not much.

Can't get the TSX wagon in a 4cyl at all, can you? When it's a diesel, get back to me. That wagon is probably the most appealing vehicle in the lineup to me.

RL is painful. Old/current one is a nice car with lots of tech, but just so bland and kind of outclassed engine-wise for the market position - and it virtually doesn't sell, faring worse than even the old GS at the end of its run. New one is invisibly styled save for the different-for-the-sake-of-being-different light eyes. I bet that won't right the ship."
29,2012-12-05T17:13:41+00:00,ateixeira,"I drove the last gen TL-S, the AWD model, and those were nice. Haven't looked lately as I'm not in to sedans.

I think you can get a TSX wagon 4 banger. It would be a better package with a manual, but that's not what the public buys so I get why it's not offered.

Acura has a real identity crisis. Honda has always wanted to be perceived as green, but Toyota stole that away with the Prius (deservingly or not). Even Hyundai cheated to beat Honda's CAFE averages. They can't catch a break.

Any how, that green image keeps them from putting a V8 in their flagship, and that's what keeps Acura from being taken seriously as a luxury make. It's really just an upscale brand.

For even more damage, Honda has been limited to being ""less than Acura"", which is why we got a cheap Civic.

And so on.

NSX will help create a halo. The AWD RL had better be a home run. They can use electric AWD with torque vectoring to keep things interesting."
30,2012-12-05T17:22:39+00:00,stever,That link you posted over in the Lincoln Motor discussion mentioned that Acuras were noisy. I thought that issue was just with the Hondas. Guess some people think all their vehicles have too much cabin noise?
31,2012-12-05T17:22:53+00:00,fintail,"The previous TL was a nice looking car too. New one - weird, and they can get expensive.

Hmm I was under the impression TSX wagon was V6 only, I see it isn't. The 4 actually has more appeal somehow, maybe out of fear of V6 transmission issues in older Honda models.

I think the RL will need to be more eye catching to make the segment take notice. The tech is nice, but if it doesn't look like a step up from a TL...hard sell. I wouldn't bank on that home run.

Like you say, Acura isn't seen as a make, because too often it isn't - too many models are fancy Hondas. I am not sure if the brand even exists outside of NA and China yet."
32,2012-12-05T17:28:36+00:00,ateixeira,"Hmm, not me. I don't think I even follow that thread.

I have noticed Hondas have a bit more road noise, the last rental Accord was like that. The brand new one supposedly fixes that, dunno.

I think mostly it's because Honda/Acura are compared to Toyota/Lexus and the latter are the masters of NVH control."

AWD is also coming, but those were not yet available. So I drove one with the new engine to see how it behaves in this vehicle, and to compare to BMW and Mercedes' 2 liter turbos.

Land Rover has used these engines in the popular Evoque, but it's basically an EcoBoost Ford powertrain, used in a variety of vehicles, from performance cars to SUVs.

Hop in and the ambience is still very much Jag, with suede headliner, covered pillars, real wood veneers (XJ has nicer burled walnut though), wool carpets, etc. Seats were a bit slippery for my tastes, but it made getting in and out pretty easy.

Press the start button and the shifter knob pops up neatly. The vents also power open. Neat, if a bit gimmicky.

Visibility is not very good. Thick pillars, chopped windows, and a high belt line make you want to check if you get cameras to park the thing (mine had them).

Short drive was not enough to leave lasting impressions about performance, but while it was quiet as a tomb, the whole car was unsettled. I wondered if the air pressure in the tires were way above spec?

Auto Start/Stop surprised me a bit, smoother than BMW's similar system, but not as seamless as a hybrid's. I guess they have to score (much) higher on CAFE, so let's get used to it.

The 2.0T reminded me of the similar engine in the Benz C class - doesn't perform as well as BMW's under-rated engine, but much smoother.

Will be interesting to see how customers respond to a tiny displacement turbo engine in a prestige brand like Jaguar.

Hopefully the ride settles down, though. As is it's just a really nice facade on an average platform."

Many areas of the Seattle area are very hilly - one reason I don't have an urge to drive a stick here. Too much work. The biggest plus to that Prius here is slow dense traffic, where it is in its element."

Seriously, they had the new Sedan (forgot the name) in the middle (fully open for sitting, poking, proding, etc) and on the walls around it, all the options, color and fabric swatches, Tesla logo garb, and a few ""Build our own"" areas. Oh, and a platform from which the car rides on also on display.

As far as the car goes, it looks incredible on the outside, the inside is really cool with a full digital dash and an IP that basically looks like an oversized Ipad. The seats looked way out of place tho, too short on the bottom and not a lot of bolstering. Also, there is no center console, so the the layout reminded me of a 70's car. Back seat was pretty spacious and visibility was pretty good.

From the reports I have read about Tesla not doing so hot financially, it must be pretty risky to try and market your product in a mall, but the foot traffic that was coming in and out of the place the day I was there, I predict not many folks know or even care about Tesla's fortunes. The place was a zoo. :shades:"

Telsa is located in the mall because they are trying to get around the dealership laws in MA. They can't sell the cars in MA from that location. It is strictly a showroom experience - you have to order it directly from Tesla in California."

The inside of the Quest had some very nice seats, but it's a little more station wagon like. Supposedly the new Chrysler T&C has a much improved engine, but the one I had was a pig, pure and simple. I don't think the Ody is in rental fleets, but regardless of color, it still looks like the back third was welded on at a junkyard. I did notice at the Honda dealer that the new Ody seems to sit lower than the others and it's predecessor. Same goes for the new CRV. Two years ago I had a Sedona - forget it. I'd turn one down if they tried to foist in off on me again. IMO it was hands down worst of the lot."

Quest felt like an SUV even down to the 3rd row, plus it is so bolt upright. The cargo area is a foot short, too, so no laying plywood down like you can in the rest.

Dodge needs a clean sheet redo. 2008 this one came out, it is the oldest option. Pentastar is a good engine but let's see a new van around it.

MB dealer had nothing remarkable. BMW dealer had oddities - maybe 8 Gran Coupes - some of them loaded to the brim with 110K MSRPs. A couple of new style M5s, and an ActiveHybrid 3er (60K MSRP) and ActiveHybrid 5er rounded out the new ones. Looked at some ATS at the Caddy lot - dealer had a dozen of them, all engines and specs, it seemed. Chatty salesman said they sold 4 last week.

The Forester is capable and we've been there in it, but we tend to travel in the van (much more space plus we have a big dog).

4WD/AWD is required as is airing down the tires. They have air so you can air up when you exit. Pretty neat setup.

Ironically I've seen way more of the Infiniti ""minivans"" than the new Pathfinder, seems like I see the JX everywhere I go. Overall I'm not a fan but I guess it's what the market wants."

The JX doesn't seem to be pretending, it has that going for it. It's an AWD minivan with conventional doors and a rear-pillar quirk to inject a little personality. I have seen a ton of them too (and I think they are even in the National rental fleet now)."

The market seems to like it, though.

Never poll enthusiasts to find out what car would sell. If they asked us, you'd build a diesel-only station wagon that only came with a manual transmission. Then they would proceed to sell 2 of them, to you and me."

Then a saw a new Sentra, first out on the roads, and it fits in too. It does look like a car from a higher price class.

Nissan has done well with its new sedans, I think."

Just more to prove how designers are copycat sycophants, maybe not unlike 1958 when the solution for almost everyone was simply to add gingerbread."

But the new one is so much better and comfortable to boot..fits in well with the family siblings.

Saw a pic of the new Forte and it looked a lot like a small Ford Fusion as I recall...prefer the current model except the horrid dash layout...with all the hard plastics it just is not something I'd want to face year after year personally. I do like the 5 door concept though and since our great luck with my kid's Hyundai Accent, I'd have no problem going with a Kia. As I've mentioned in another forum, the only domestic brand I'd buy right now is the Buick Verano. Except for the poor vision out the rear with the headrests in place, I was extremely impressed without even taking a test drive. Comfortable seating with great ergonomics and controls right where they should be...I just felt so comfortable and at home in that car that if things were different, I'd sigh the papers today and trade my beloved Civic!

So far I've seen:

-Jag XJ, these are really big especially if you look at their size compared to the big Jags of yore. Looked great in dark green, not so much in snow white.

-Audi A7, same deal, the white one I saw didn't look that good for a new Audi but then I saw a metallic grey one, niiice!

-Porsche (981) Boxster S, looks even nicer than in photos, it actually looks smaller than older models by a little but lines are more agressive. Me want!

-McLaren MP-4 Something, Something-C. I saw one last year and wasn't that impressed but this year they were showing off a copper colored coupe and a dark grey Spider. Both looked (and sounded) great.

No new Corvettes so far but everywhere you go you see new Pony Cars- Camaros, Mustangs and Challengers all seem equally popular."

I swear I didn't actually break it.

I think the IS might be one of the 3% who buy them who see it as sporty. Different world.

Visited an out of town MB dealer today - much larger selection than the one nearest me. Notable was an S400 hybrid, loaded 86K C63, and a couple of E wagons that were pretty loaded (P2, pano) - but no leather. A 68K car with vinyl interior, love it. There's a new silver color for the C that I like, almost a bluish hint to it. Also saw a couple new Fusions."

Love the panos. Hyundai has a nice one on the Elantra GT.

Which S class sells best? Bet it's a mid level V8."

Pano is something we can thank MB for - the W211 really got that fad rolling.

No doubt S550 sells best - more availability. And the typical S buyer is traditional - the hybrid will be too weird, and the diesel too unconventional. For me, the diesel would be a no-brainer."

Since it looks like an older Land Rover anyway I couldn't tell it was a newer one or not. It's just odd seeing it. The other is I've been seeing the new Subaru XV's popping up everywhere. Very nice looking.

Indeed I have. I bought it in 1991 with 70K miles on it and have never looked back. Your point about the output is well taken. I believe that the 300SE was actually faster.

Those values for the guzzlers that would have qualified would keep out the best cars - although maybe some fairly decent ones would have been included, esp if trade in values were used. It's a shame to lose old quality material like that, but at the same time, those turning in the cars probably hadn't cared for them in a long time, and deferred maintenance can easily exceed the value of the car.

Better yet, they were studded snow tires which helped a lot on snow and ice. PA state law stated you couldn't have them on the car earlier than November 15th or later than April 15th as they tended to be rough on paved roads.

I think that is one of the biggest problems with snow tires (at least in areas of the Country where snow season is not garaunteed), you put them on and they get worn out fast when they go a season on dry pavement. Plus IIRC, snows tend to be noisy on dry roads as well."

Bear in mind that the TSX Tech and the Crosstour EXL 4wd are within about $1k of each other and both have Navi:

TSX pros-
More overall cargo volume
Slightly better over all mileage (22/30)
Better warranty
Likely sportier handling (haven't driven one)
Real roof rails (hey, I'm a skier)
Lighter

TSX cons-
4cyl/5AT combo only - 200hp
Rear shock tower housing eats up a lot of cargo space
Fwd only

Crosstour pros-
V6 is meatier and comes with the new 6AT- 278hp and actual torque
AWD
New 13 Accord tech like hondalink & apps, blind spot camera, forward collision and lane departure warning integrated in crosstour / not avail on TSX
More rear legroom

Crosstour cons-
Less MPG (19/28 for V6 AWD)
Less warranty
Less total cargo volume
NO roof rails
Heavier

To me, a loss of 2mpg would be worth the extra power, torque and awd. And actually, I think the power/MPG ratio is pretty respectable on the xtour. The overall cargo volume is less obviously due to the sloping back, but given that the length and width of the cargo area are pretty similar, I don't know if most people would be losing a lot in the real world.

The other competitors here I suppose are the Outback and Venza: Outback is more practical, better awd system, similar price in LTD H6 form, but has a cheaper interior quality, less power and mpg, and less interior tech. The Venza has the power and space, but also has a cheaper interior quality, less MPG and forces you into those stupid 19 and 20"" wheels.

Anyhow, I guess I'm saying I'm not seeing the worldwide Crosstour hate. Your mileage may vary..."
43,2013-02-07T12:31:04+00:00,hoosiergrandad,"Couldn't have said it better myself.........and when comparing 2012 vs 2013 Crosstours, its like comparing 2012 vs 2013 Accords."

I'd test drive one if they had it.

Fit's gas tank is puny, otherwise I'd at least consider it. 10.6 gallons vs the Mazda3's 14.5 gallon tank. The Mazda will go a lot farther per tankful."

They put the battery under the rear seats and that squeezes fuel capacity, thus limiting range.

Good city car, anyway."
46,2013-02-07T15:15:23+00:00,ateixeira,"Rear shock tower housing eats up a lot of cargo space

Isn't that the case with the Crosstour also?

I measured the width of the cargo area and it's very weak in that area, in fact the Outback was a full *foot* wider there.

You expect an inch or two, sure, but a foot?"
47,2013-02-07T16:23:27+00:00,hoosiergrandad,"Those shock towers are a problem IF you need the space.If you do , you won't get a Crosstour. They don't bother me ( I have 3 trucks if I need to haul much)
but wouldn't do for some. I think of my CT as a large 4WD hatchback sedan.........a fairly unique design that suits me, but apparently not too many others."
48,2013-02-07T17:15:04+00:00,ateixeira,"I like the CT but the kids will veto it due to the small back seat.

Did I tell you, they liked the Prius V (back seat roomy, reclines, awesome panoramic moonroof) and the Jeep Wrangler TWO door (cool factor). I can't think of two cars that are more opposite.

Plus both are too big and not really city cars, not at all what I'm looking for."

Sidenote: Audi says they are killing the A3 hatch for slow sales in the US. If true, the ones they do sell must be mostly to the bay area...I see them everywhere. There are 4 on my street alone."

True - the A3 sedan will be the new base for Audi.

15,2013-02-08T02:11:10+00:00,boomchek,"I saw one on the road about a month ago. Agree with you it's an odd duck to be FWD in such a large car. The Deville/DTS it replaced, which was also fwd had better proportions.

Just look at Acura and their dismal sales of the RL, partially because it's a bland FWD based V6 ""premium luxury sedan"""
16,2013-02-08T03:01:48+00:00,fintail,"And MB dropped it. I think they still have a dark blue (no thanks, hard to maintain), and a silver that kind of has a blue tint to it. But that quartz blue was cool, like a modern version of my fintail.

There is a color called ""universe blue"" offered on the upcoming CLA that might have potential.

On the car front, saw a new Accord today, in traffic behind a 96-97 Accord. Reminiscent of a new Accord with a Crosstour behind it, my how they have grown.

Also had a current style A4 in front of me in traffic today, it was smoking like an 80s MB diesel (not a plume, but definite emissions off the line). I wonder what was wrong."

They also had LeMans Blue, Topaz Blue, Estoril Blue, Laguna Seca Blue, Montego Blue Avus Blue, Fjord Blue and many more. Sadly they now only offer Deep Sea Blue (dark blue) or Water Blue (light blue) for most models. Like everyone else they now offer four shades of grey or silver, black, white and red."
18,2013-02-08T13:57:15+00:00,robr2,"Why not today?

According to one article I found:

White, black and silver are ""tech"" colors - those colors are sleek and modern.

Boredom - since people keep their cars longers, that flashy teal might be nice today but not so much in 7 years.

Resale - who's going to want to buy that orange car you had to have 6 years ago?

Vibrant colors do better in Asia while the basics listed above are popular in North America and Europe even more."
19,2013-02-08T14:33:08+00:00,ateixeira,"It's made the palette so dull, though. There are hardly any colors out there.

I wouldn't mind a red or yellow car next time, if it's the right model for a flashy color. I'm kind of tired of blues."

It's pretty bad that the return of brown was actually kind of exciting, as it was different.

Oh, saw a ""sport"" variant new Santa Fe. Not offensive, not sure what the point of the window in the C-pillar is for - too small and high for visibility, just to let in light I guess. Must be a monster for a small person to maneuver in a garage."

Wonder how the C-Max noise levels compare?

I think C&D measures road noise for comparos, I'll do a quick search..."
29,2013-02-08T17:31:30+00:00,ateixeira,"Looks like C&D hasn't compared them yet, I imagine that's coming.

Detroit Free Press (as pro-Domestic as they get) complained about noise on the C-Max also:

http://www.freep.com/article/20121220/COL14/312200068/Ford-C-Max-hybrid-excels-i- n-affordability-roominess-and-fuel-economy

Both out of my target price range for now, low 30s for Ford and mid 30s for the V loaded up. I don't think Ford's moonroof is the panoramic kind, plus the fam hated the back seat (and they're right about that).

Too bad, I prefer the shorter overall length and is has a bigger gas tank for great range.

Ted Britt Ford is advertising $4000 off, so a loaded $32k one would be $28k. Definitely better priced."
30,2013-02-08T17:51:24+00:00,boomchek,"Oh, saw a ""sport"" variant new Santa Fe.

No sure how it is in the states but here in Canada all of the current Santa Fes are called Sport. When the longer wheelbase 7 seater comes out it will be called just a Santa Fe. The Sport badge is meant to indicate it's a shorty 5 seater.

They're actually very nice cars, and fully loaded they top out at $40k, about $3k more than a loaded Tucson here. I think it's well worth the extra 3 grand over a Tucson but if I were in the market for a SUV I'd have a hard time justifying $40k for a Hyundai SUV even though it's absolutely loaded."
31,2013-02-08T18:21:44+00:00,ateixeira,"They up-sized it, seems more like a Ford Edge competitor now, vs. the old one competing with the Ford Escape."
32,2013-02-08T18:29:38+00:00,boomchek,"The old one was an odd size. Since most people compared them to Hondas too, it was sized in between a CRV and a Pilot."
33,2013-02-08T18:30:48+00:00,ateixeira,"Wasn't there a (tiny) 3rd row option?

Kinda silly to see them on such smallish crossovers. At least they came to their senses and only the LWB model seats 7 now."
34,2013-02-08T18:32:33+00:00,boomchek,"In Canada they offered the 3rd row only in 2008 iirc. Then it got discontinued.

They'll offer it on the longer SF now because the Veracruz is discontinued and I guess it's cheaper to make an extended SF rather than a completely new larger model."
35,2013-02-08T18:53:17+00:00,ateixeira,"Yeah, the Veracruz is being phased out. It was rather invisible anyway.

I sat in one a while back and it was really comfortable, but didn't stand out and the powertrain was dated. The LWB Sante Fe is getting a DI V6 and modern trans."
36,2013-02-08T19:13:01+00:00,fintail,"That's how it works here too, bigger one isn't the sport. Haven't seen one of those yet, or maybe have and ignored it.

Soon these things will need side and front view cameras, too. And you know how I think, for 40K I'd rather buy a highline model with CPO or aftermarket warranty, and enjoy it."
37,2013-02-08T19:19:37+00:00,boomchek,"Yeah well here for $40k you'll get a 4 year old X5 or ML, a new loaded VW Tiguan (they're very steeply priced) or a 2-3 year old bland Lexus RX.

What I like about the top Santa Fe is that it has a lot of premium features like rear sunshades built into the doors, rear heated seats, front cooled and heated seats, nav, backup camera, front and back parking sensors, pano roof, keyless go, driver selectable steering etc.... I might have missed a few. I don't mean to sound like a brochure but I am impressed with the level of equipment in these. But, and it's a big but, the 2.0L T although producing 280-something HP, I don't think it's as torquey or suitable for towing as the old V6 was, even though most people never towed anything."
38,2013-02-08T19:28:19+00:00,fintail,"That RX is probably what the average buyer of one really wants, esp if they are a certain gender.

I built my own Santa Fe Sport - loaded was 35K, which is probably quite a value - although the US site didn't mention the shades, steering, sensors, etc. I too wonder about that displacement for something that size, it'll be working pretty hard even if it has raw hp."
39,2013-02-08T19:36:43+00:00,explorerx4,"In addition to wind and road noise, the V engine in load and coarse, too.
It felt like literally a 10 year old car with new technology transplanted into it.
It is roomy and pretty efficient, though.
Spotted a new Fiat 500 in the parking lot at work"
40,2013-02-08T19:45:29+00:00,boomchek,"The Limited Sport Tech Pkg adds those. I forgot that it has the heated steering wheel as well.

On a side note whenever I play around with US car websites and they require me to input a zip code I always do 90210 as I don't know of any other US zip code. I wonder when they check their site stats if they have a disproportionate number hits that they think are from Beverly Hills. :P"
41,2013-02-08T19:54:37+00:00,stever,"lol, could be. I do that a lot too."
42,2013-02-08T19:56:20+00:00,fintail,"Oh yeah, I see that on the Limited. 37K USD. A far cry from the ugly lumpy Santa Fe of 10 years ago.

Canadian sites don't ask for a postcode, do they. Funny. I know German sites don't. The sales pitch must be higher pressure in the US."
43,2013-02-08T20:05:16+00:00,boomchek,Canadian sites do ask for it. I guess it's mainly for tracking traffic and sometimes frieght/pdi charges and regional offers vary across the country.
44,2013-02-08T21:19:44+00:00,ateixeira,"The C-Max has a 2l engine and more combined power. Real world mileage is high 30s, but the fuel tank is bigger so I was OK with that. The kids were not OK with the rear seat, unfortunately.

I also want a small car and the C-Max is shorter than the regular Prius (much shorter than the V).

Still bumming about that."
45,2013-02-08T22:41:56+00:00,tifighter,"2014 Transit Connect. Will have optional pano roof. The short wheelbase model is only 174 inches long - the same as the C-Max.

Okay, I know this isn't what you are looking for. I'm just projecting...I really like the looks of the new Ford Vanlet. Its looking like a CCB year."
46,2013-02-09T00:05:34+00:00,ateixeira,"Those are cool but the family found them repulsive looking and refused to even check it out. It was closed anyway at the DC show.

Toyota was next to Ford this year. Funny, because upstairs had been the domestic area, while the imports were in the basement. I guess Toyotas are mostly made here and they race in NASCAR so they moved.

For my family that meant we compared the C-max and Prius V back to back.

In the Prius family I like the C best (fuel misers should be small and light), then the V (pano), then the regular Prius last.

They didn't like the 3 SkyActiv either."
47,2013-02-09T01:37:49+00:00,berri,"I've been looking at 2003 crossovers. One thing I noticed is that the latest Detroit offerings generally have much nicer interiors than the Asians. The latter are often just a sea of blah grey or black plastic, sometimes shiny, and they tend to look cheap. Hopefully the 2014 Highlander and Pilot will address this because neither is very attractive inside to me at least. Another weird thing, the new Traverse seemed to have better, more comfortable seats than the Enclave despite costing quite a bit less. The Buick had short seat bottoms in comparison - maybe because older people shrink as they age?"
48,2013-02-09T02:44:02+00:00,boomchek,"Our friends have a new Durango. The interior is super nice in it and they used to have an X5, MDX, and a Mercedes GL before it.

0,2013-02-09T02:59:53+00:00,berri,"I noticed that too. Big honkin' hood on that Durango, but it's got to hold a Hemi, right? I think maybe this Marchionne is really starting to make a difference at Chrysler. Quality and style seem to be improving over there, that's for sure."
1,2013-02-09T03:05:14+00:00,boomchek,"Yeah much nicer than the plastics in the Calibers I was selling in 07 although I did drive a Caliber variant, the Jeep Patriot for a couple of years myself. Decent little pseudo SUV."
2,2013-02-09T15:47:42+00:00,ateixeira,"Chrysler gets the most improved interiors award for sure. Dad's 200 convertible is nice inside. I'd like to see a full redesign of the 200 to see what they can do to the rest of the car, though."
3,2013-02-11T19:08:09+00:00,fintail,"Out on foot this morning, saw a Tesla sedan. Then walked to the post office about an hour ago - saw a truck carrying 5 (!) Tesla sedans."

Galvanizing covers a broad spectrum of applications using zinc. The best application is hot dipping but that leaves a thick finish that can't be painted or welded.

Hard to believe), but the process was poorly designed and implemented, and the rustproofing materials never made it to many body locations.

That, coupled with a thinner steel body and no fender-well liners in the first several year model runs, and owners got bodies that rusted quickly...

From Wikipedia...

After a six-stage zinc phosphate rustproofing process and two minutes submerged in a 65,000 US gallons (246,052 L; 54,124 imp gal) electrophoretic painting vat (Fisher Body Division&#146;s ""Elpo"" electrophoretic deposition of polymers process) to prime and further protect them from rust, assembled bodies were dried, wet-sanded, sealer-coated, sprayed with acrylic lacquer and baked in a 300 °F (149 °C) degree oven. Fisher's rustproofing was faulty. Failure to penetrate a gap between front fenders and cowl allowed moist debris and salt to rust the untreated steel, and trapped air prevented coating inside the tops of the front fenders, which on early Vegas had no protective liners.[8] The finance department had rejected liners as they would have added a $2.28 unit cost. After GM spent millions replacing thousands of corroded fenders under warranty, Chevrolet installed stopgap plastic deflectors in late 1973 and full plastic liners in 1974. Rust also damaged the rocker panels and door bottoms, the area beneath the windshield, and the body above the rockers. It sometimes seized the front suspension cam bolts, preventing alignment work, necessitating removal with a cutting torch and replacement by all-new parts."

It may be that they don't stand out when I see one usually from the rear. I recognized one a couple weeks ago on the interstate downtown. In black. Looked okay. Then I realized it was next to a black Focus, a new one. Their rears look similar other than the Focus has Sonata syndrome and is overstyled.

Lots of examples of that."
17,2013-02-27T14:35:23+00:00,ateixeira,"I'm seeing price creep, big time. Mainstream SUVs loaded up are hitting $50k, an Escalade is closer to $70k nowadays.

At that level prices have shifted upward about $20 grand over the past decade. Scary."
18,2013-02-27T15:19:31+00:00,fintail,"I think it has really exploded in the past 5 years - more of that inflation the powers that be don't want to admit. Still amazes me that a 3er can hit 60K these days, that 5ers and Es can get to 80K."
19,2013-02-27T16:02:08+00:00,anythngbutgm,Escalade Platinum's are priced in the 90's.

Speechless."
21,2013-02-27T16:05:56+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Seeing a few of those new Evoque's around lately. I'm digging the styling except for the gun slit rear end.

Also another new Range Rover, this one in Triple Black.

Base model Mazda6, couple of new Altimas, a new Fusion (which is surprisingly rare find) and a Hyundai Equus."

Not quite $90K. They ESV Platinum with every option ticked (ok - wheel locks are the only option) is $86K.

For comparison:
Navigator L $70K
Lexus LX570 $92K
The various Range Rover models start at $83K to $130K. The Autobiography model tops out at $139K!!"

25,2013-02-27T20:01:12+00:00,boomchek,"A loaded Escalade here in Canada is pushing close to $110k, which I think is a bit outrageous for basically a dressed up Chevy frame and powertrain with a SUV body, 3 bench seats, and some leather and wood trim.

Escalade price"
26,2013-02-27T20:14:08+00:00,fintail,"Canada gets hosed on a lot of car related things. Are those prices inclusive of tax?

I notice the Canadian equivalent to my new car is about 10K more - but Canadian models have standard leather."
27,2013-02-27T20:17:54+00:00,boomchek,"That's plus 12% taxes = so it's about $120k with taxes, and I think there's a gas guzzler levy of $5000 on top of that too. :surprise:

Surprisingly small economy cars are priced about the same now as in the US, it's just the luxury cars that are priced more."
28,2013-02-27T20:22:06+00:00,fintail,120K+ - who'd spend that on an Escalade? Sounds insane even for a Rover or a G-wagen.
29,2013-02-27T20:47:04+00:00,boomchek,"I'd blow that on a G if I were looking for the most capable SUV out there.

Not a Range Rover though. I see the last gen 2004 and up models for $5-$10k at the auction, with the usualy saggy suspension, dashboard lit up like a christmas tree, and half the electronics not working :lemon:"
30,2013-02-27T21:25:39+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Capable yes, but for less than the price of either the Gangsta's School Bus or a RR, I go right for a Mercedes GL which is quicker, tows more, gets better mileage (even in petrol form) and costs less. Then there's that diesel... :shades:

Mercedes also nailed it with the styling as well IMO.

The Gelandewagon is cool but I think the old Oxcart suspension might be tiring for me and the thing has the aerodynamics of a brick"
31,2013-02-27T21:30:16+00:00,boomchek,"The GL is actually quite spacious. Our friends had one and when we were on holidays, after checking in to a hotel we were able to explore our vacation destination in their GL, with 4 of us adults, and our 2 kids in baby seats, plus 2 strollers and other baby stuff.

The only thing he had to replace was the tranny but since it was under warranty it saved him about $7k :surprise:"
32,2013-02-27T21:41:22+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Yikes, 7 grand! :surprise: Was it an older one?

I hardly hear of Mercedes trannies going South, at least not until they get into the higher miles. My wifes business partner had one of the first CLS's and he replaced his about 130k but he is a pretty aggressive driver as well.

If I had a big family and I needed a hauler, (and had theat kind of coin to spend ) the GL320 would be it."
33,2013-02-27T21:45:02+00:00,boomchek,I think my friend's GL was a 2006 or so.

Range Rovers are dangerous. The pre-03 are becoming extinct already, along with early Discos."

And not new, but the 5er GT that's been sitting at a higher line used lot is still there - maybe 3 months now? I am kind of feeling sorry for it."
36,2013-02-28T02:49:49+00:00,boomchek,"I saw a 5 series GT on the road a few days ago coming towards me and it's an akward looking beast. My buddy who has the CLS said he sat in it and loves it and would buy one if it was cheap enough (he's 6'3"" and like 230+lbs) so maybe it's spacious for his size, but I can't get used to the looks from any angle on that car."
37,2013-02-28T03:00:38+00:00,fintail,"The one here is a 550i, high options, and I am certain it could be had for under 40K now. Probably a lot of car for the money, if one can get over the bizarre looks."
38,2013-02-28T06:17:51+00:00,tifighter,"Although I expect to get flamed, I don't really have a big issue with the 5GT. If it remains unwanted and depreciates enough, I could be convinced. First choice? No, but if the deal was really good, and it had xDrive..."

This AM their old (I think gen 1, maybe 2) CRV was still there. So I am guessing that the dad upgraded to new wheels (the mom has a pilot for toting around the 3 kids).

They broke up the run of 4 straight multiple Honda (if you count my fleet of Acuras). In between us is another CRV/Pilot combo, and the other side of them is a Pilot/Accord."
42,2013-03-03T21:34:22+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a new Escape.

Then, right next door to that new Accord I saw recently, a new Civic. Probably jealous and had to get a new Honda as well.

First of the new Civics I've seen up close, nice face lift at the front."
43,2013-03-04T00:51:12+00:00,fintail,"Someone in my building has a new trunkback Impreza. Not a bad choice.

Saw a number of new Audis as I used the car wash located alongside the local dealer (free perk with the new car) - they don't really make me drool, aside from the A7."
44,2013-03-04T00:59:07+00:00,boomchek,"I agree, the A7 is stunning. The others are nice too but they look like they've changed very little from the mid 90s to now even though they went through several complete redesigns."
45,2013-03-04T01:31:10+00:00,jpp75,"Does the Impreza have the CVT? I've liked the Legacy's I've rented lately except for the transmission.

I love the A4 from a styling perspective but don't understand why they sell so well. My partner has one and it's underwhelming to say the least. Nyccarguy mentioned that his wife drives the 328xi every chance she gets, that's how a car should be. I only drive the A4 if it's the logical choice based on how the cars are parked in the driveway."
46,2013-03-04T01:32:10+00:00,fintail,"The A4 especially makes me kind of yawn, and even the A6 and A8 don't appeal to me like the competition. Like the A8 rental I had in Germany - superfancy car, but no emotional stigma - where if I had a comparably equipped S or 7er, I might be more excited. Maybe it's my own bias, but maybe not.

Oh, just saw an X1 apparently out for a test drive, had the dangly temp dealer plate stuck to the back."
47,2013-03-04T01:33:20+00:00,fintail,"I think it does. I know the new Impreza is capable of impressive mileage for an AWD car, something like 36 highway.

Another Audi issue is that the published lease rates seem to be a lot higher than the other Germans."
48,2013-03-04T01:38:04+00:00,jpp75,"That's much better than any other car I've had, the Legacy does get decent mileage but I just can't warm up to the rubber band transmission."

I just checked the specs and the Accord is only 0.2 of an inch narrower so no surprise there but the Caddy seems like it is too narrow for such a large car, even though overall it's not a bad looking thing.

The other one I saw was a dealership car in black color I think on the highway as well.

Cadillac needed a newer flagship for a long time but not sure if this one will cut it."
15,2013-03-15T11:32:33+00:00,robr2,"Cadillac needed a newer flagship for a long time but not sure if this one will cut it.

It's not supposed to be the flagship. Cadillac plans on bringing out a proper RWD, 7/S/LS competitor shortly.

The XTS is a placeholder and will stick around for livery service."
16,2013-03-15T12:25:53+00:00,tjc78,"I love the XTS, but for some reason it seems smaller inside than my 12 Lacrosse which it is based on. I agree it's not a flagship sedan, but cushy FWD cars do sell (think Lexus ES). I bet they become a great value used."
17,2013-03-15T14:34:22+00:00,ateixeira,"Near the Krispy Kreme store in Gaithersburg, MD.

Owner should not eat too many donuts as it's a fairly compact sports sedan."
18,2013-03-15T14:50:48+00:00,lemko,Wow! I can't wait! Hope they don't disappoint me!
19,2013-03-15T15:04:39+00:00,robr2,It's going to be a large RWD sedan based on the Omega platform. Look for it for the 2015 model year.
20,2013-03-15T18:12:09+00:00,boomchek,I guess it replaced the DTS which I don't see on Cadillac's website anymore.
21,2013-03-15T22:17:56+00:00,stickguy,an XV Crosstek on the road. I like it. Just seems nicer (more substantial? Taller?) than an Imprezza.
22,2013-03-15T22:44:07+00:00,andys120,"I guess it replaced the DTS which I don't see on Cadillac's website anymore.

They had to, DTS market is mostly gone to the Great Showroom in the Sky. I've always wondered why big FWDs are so popular in places like Florida and Arizona but the old folks really think it's safer even where it never snowqs."
23,2013-03-15T22:50:22+00:00,boomchek,"Yeah the DTS has been around since 2001 when it was called the Deville/Deville DTS. I think it got a mild facelift and had its edges sharpened about 4 or 5 years ago and was renames the DTS then.

I liked the Devilles from 01/02/03 as I rented them a few times and for those days they were nice cars to cruise around in."
24,2013-03-15T23:30:35+00:00,stever,"FWDs are so popular in places like Florida and Arizona but the old folks really think it's safer even where it never snowqs

Lot of them are snowbirds. Then there's the friend I got my Outback from in Anchorage. She got another new one and took the old one to her AZ condo."
25,2013-03-16T01:15:21+00:00,berri,"Honestly, I wonder if more than 10 or 15% of Cadillac buyers really care FWD or RWD. AWD might matter a bit though."
26,2013-03-16T01:26:28+00:00,fintail,"Today saw a new Avalon rental, and a new S5 that I thought might rear-end the Accord in front of it, but hit the brakes in time."
27,2013-03-16T01:27:21+00:00,stever,The FWD ones may feel roomier without the transmission hump in them.
28,2013-03-16T17:50:19+00:00,andys120,"Lot of them are snowbirds. Then there's the friend I got my Outback from in Anchorage. She got another new one and took the old one to her AZ condo.

True, I'm one of those but ironically I have RWD in NH as well as in AZ. My Dad never drives anywhere north of say Orlando but wants FWD and he's not unusual."
29,2013-03-16T18:48:59+00:00,explorerx4,i Miev. Looks a lot smaller/narrower than a Leaf.
30,2013-03-16T19:25:47+00:00,ateixeira,Are those only sold regionally? I haven't seen one in person.
31,2013-03-16T19:43:57+00:00,boomchek,"I've seen one too. Looks like a narrow fiberclass kind of car. Not sure if they're retail units as all of the ones I've seen have those electric car graphics on them.

Well Vancouver is open to this tyoe if vehicle experimentation so you see a lot of funky cars here from time to time."
32,2013-03-17T17:52:04+00:00,fintail,"This morning saw a new rental Altima, loaded looking Fusion (really resembles Avalon from the side), Allroad, and not new, but saw a E350 coupe in unusual designo ""Mauritius Blue"", and the poor 5er GT on a local lot is still sitting there, I think about 3 months now."
33,2013-03-17T20:20:41+00:00,ateixeira,People at the dealer cold not show me the two different ways to open the hatch. I don't even think they want to sell them.
34,2013-03-17T21:19:51+00:00,fintail,"Probably some poor training, average BMW salesman is probably used to only showing people how to lease a base 3er. That GT will eventually be a bargain, I bet it could be had for no more than 35K now, would have been well over twice that new.

New cars this afternoon: 2x 2014 Forester at the dealer, 2x Tesla sedan (one at dealer, one on road), local Lexus dealer literally has 30 or more CTs sitting on one side of the lot, weird."
35,2013-03-17T21:55:02+00:00,ateixeira,Saw a dozen or so new X5 and X1 at Rockville BMW while at a furniture store next door.
36,2013-03-18T00:17:05+00:00,tjc78,"New Avalon at the store this morning (great side profile, but the front is just hideous). Then I sat in a family members new 328 xdrive. Meh. I could find better ways to spend 47k. I didn't have the heart to ask, but I'm pretty sure it was vinyl interior. They said they already had the start/stop disabled."
37,2013-03-18T01:15:04+00:00,fintail,"You can load MBs up well into the 60s with a vinyl interior. But....it's a really convincing pleather. That doesn't get to me - Euros making xenons optional or part of expensive packages irks me, with base lights being pretty weak.

I saw an X1 with stop/start the other day, it was noticeable when the engine restarted."
38,2013-03-18T03:58:14+00:00,andys120,Saw a new Cadillac XTS pulling into a parking space. I'm never gonna be a Big-a-llac type but I must say this was the best looking big Cadillac I've seen since the 60s. For a scaled up CTS it wears it's proportions very well and the detailing is very nice. I particularly liked the tailfin-shaped rear lights which added a little flamboyance to a conservative design.
39,2013-03-18T12:16:35+00:00,tjc78,"For a scaled up CTS

No relation to the CTS at all. FWD layout shared with the Buick LaCrosse. I agree its a looker."
40,2013-03-18T15:03:39+00:00,ateixeira,"I saw one yesterday, from perhaps the least flattering angle - the rear view. Looks much better from the front and in profile.

Still a handsome car. 12.1"" LCD screen - yes please! :shades:"
41,2013-03-18T21:57:43+00:00,robr2,"Euros making xenons optional or part of expensive packages irks me...

Extra charge for metallic paint is what irks me."
42,2013-03-18T23:06:49+00:00,ateixeira,Extra charge for a manual trans is what irks me!
43,2013-03-18T23:47:13+00:00,fintail,"For most of them, that extra manual charge isn't cheap - pack up and move to Europe!

I can deal with the paint thing - that's been a longstanding tradition in Europe. It allows for greater color variety. But in year 2013, decent lighting packages on 60K+ cars should be standard. Some of the base lighting looks 1990s tech.

I visited the dealer today to pick up my floor mats, and sat in a new loaded GL450 - 80K sticker. Nice tank, but would be a shame to ruin something so pretty (pearl white, beige/almond leather) with devilspawn kids."
44,2013-03-19T00:01:36+00:00,ateixeira,"I got to ride in one and my heart was broken - it handled like a pig.

Even compared to my minivan.

They're just too massive. Felt like 3 tons. Shoot, probably is."
45,2013-03-19T00:27:58+00:00,texases,"Went this weekend to the Dallas car show, not earthshaking, but I was happy to see the X1 had enough headroom, even with a sunroof. Same for the new Rav4, the Escape, and the C-Max. But the sedans were a washout, I don't see much in the way of a replacement for my MKZ hybrid, they all come with sunroofs and limited headroom."
46,2013-03-19T00:28:29+00:00,fintail,It's a tank. Nothing that tall and heavy can handle like a car. Probably no worse than a Lexus LX though.
47,2013-03-19T00:46:03+00:00,ateixeira,"Even M-B can't cheat the laws of physics.

5401 lbs, no wonder. My van with an F1 car on the roof rack."
48,2013-03-19T04:00:15+00:00,fintail,"I'm sure it would be nice for long road trips, especially as a passenger."
49,2013-03-20T00:34:20+00:00,fintail,"Saw 2x Verano today, at least one wasn't a rental.

I also noticed the swoopy H on the rear of the Elantra GT is gigantic."
0,2013-03-20T00:55:37+00:00,ateixeira,"At Fitzgerald Hyundai White Flint.

Not as big as expected, 3rd row will be for tots only."
1,2013-03-20T01:47:27+00:00,stickguy,"that is the problem with mid size 3 rows utes. The seat is barely usable, and if it is up you have no cargo space.

basically OK for running a few extra kids around town, as long as they don't have sports gear!

last year I rode in the 3rd row of an MDX> It was painful.

if you really need 3 rows, you need a minivan. Unless you don't mind driving a Suburban."
2,2013-03-20T01:49:12+00:00,tjc78,Imagine the third row in my Mom's RAV 4. :sick:
3,2013-03-20T01:52:41+00:00,stickguy,"I couldn't believe they ever tried that. I looked at one, and couldn't imagine ever using it.

I guess no one else did either, since they got rid of it in the redesign. Much better as a space for the spare tire!"
4,2013-03-20T18:18:32+00:00,ateixeira,"Yep, the 3rd row is gone, and probably shouldn't ever have been there in the first place.

The new RAV4 looks smaller, or is it just an impression? I remember the last one had different wheelbases, the US model was longer than the one that Europe got. Wonder if they went to just one now?"
5,2013-03-20T18:31:30+00:00,tifighter,"New RAV is two inches shorter in length, half an inch taller, basically same width. Mostly, its a styling trick."
6,2013-03-20T18:40:42+00:00,ateixeira,Is the European model the same size now? I wonder.
7,2013-03-20T18:53:19+00:00,texases,And the length difference is probably just the result of moving the spare tire inside.
8,2013-03-20T18:58:00+00:00,kyfdx,"3rd row? When we test drove a RAV4 in Fall, 2011, I thought the 2nd row felt like a jump seat...

I didn't like it, at all... (well.. the 268 hp V-6 wasn't bad.. )"
9,2013-03-20T20:03:49+00:00,ateixeira,"Great engine, the 2GR. For a while that was Toyota's quickest vehicle to 60mph.

Ironic!"
10,2013-03-21T02:22:15+00:00,fintail,"I feel like I am seeing 100 new ES per day, now. Also saw a silver Tesla sedan - silver is so played out, it is even boring on that vehicle.

Senior director level manager (aka big bucks) at work talked to me today, told me he is thinking about a Leaf. He now drives a 5er and his wife has a Highlander. Gas prices are irking him. I told him to go for it and take a drive, it might suit his commuting grind well."
11,2013-03-21T16:36:57+00:00,ateixeira,"I think it has decent low-speed acceleration, too.

Also saw a new ES today, impatient driver was honking at people, LOL.

Then I saw a new Accord V6 with Christmas lights (LEDs under the head lights)."
12,2013-03-21T16:53:44+00:00,kyfdx,qbrozen has a Leaf...
13,2013-03-21T21:35:45+00:00,andys120,"I watched as a couple of good-sized people got into their Scion iQ. It was a little like watching one of those circus clown car acts in reverse but once in they looked pretty comfortable. It is amazingly small for a four-seater, it appears to be no larger than the 2-seat Smart Car.

I'm seeing a fair number of those out here and Fiat 500s seem to be selling well too (not much bigger than the iQ)."
14,2013-03-22T02:01:57+00:00,fintail,"Electric torque, too bad all good things come to an end.

Saw an ES again today, along with probably the same silver Tesla from yesterday, a yellow Dart, and a new style RAV4.

Regarding horns, I told myself the new car would mellow out my horn use(gotta wake up these distracted dolts, the lights don't stay green forever) - it probably has, but I know what it sounds like now :shades:"
15,2013-03-22T14:16:07+00:00,lemko,"One thing I noticed is, the nicer the car you are driving, the more distracted and idiotic the other drivers seem to be."
16,2013-03-22T15:01:29+00:00,fintail,"For me, the faster the car I am in, the more clueless the idiots around me. I used the E55 horn a lot more than I use the fintail's horn - but it doesn't get used zero, either."
17,2013-03-22T15:07:19+00:00,stever,"No wonder I never have any stories for Inconsiderate Drivers, Lemko.

It's all clear now."
18,2013-03-22T16:57:23+00:00,kyfdx,Yeah... it's all based on your own fear of loss.... :P
19,2013-03-22T19:33:19+00:00,stever,"lol, yeah, I have nightmares that I'm going to experience unintended acceleration pulling into my garage and wind up totaling both the Outback and the Quest. Oh, the humanity (not to mention the $5,000 loss!)."
20,2013-03-22T19:48:28+00:00,kyfdx,"Spotted a new BMW 650i Gran Coupe on the road, today... That's the 4-door version of the 6-series... It's very nice..."
21,2013-03-22T19:54:36+00:00,boomchek,"I like the 650i too, the 4 door one, one of my fav BMW's on the market today."
22,2013-03-25T19:54:13+00:00,fintail,"Saw a white Gran Coupe this morning, and some kind of electric motorcycle."
23,2013-03-25T20:14:55+00:00,robr2,Saw a black Tesla over the weekend with Mass plates. I guess the suit by the auto dealers to block Tesla in MA isn't working.
24,2013-03-25T22:39:25+00:00,lemko,...red Dodge Dart near Montour and Levick in NE Philly.
25,2013-03-26T00:39:07+00:00,stickguy,"Darts must be getting out there finally. I saw a black one (or was it red?) yesterday, and a white one today."
26,2013-03-26T18:35:03+00:00,fintail,Saw a privately owned Verano and a white Tesla sedan this morning.
27,2013-03-27T00:34:19+00:00,odie6l,"I spotted my first Ford C-Max in the parking garage at work today. It had that ehh styling to it in natural light.

Odie"
28,2013-03-27T14:58:23+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Selling briskly, I'm seeing lots of them.

Spotted a new RR yesterday, what a beast. Looking forward to checking it out in NY. :shades:"
29,2013-03-28T15:21:26+00:00,iwant12,"A surgeon I work with bought a new black Tesla S and gave me a quick spin around the block yesterday. Impressive acceleration for sure, kinda strange, though, without any exhaust note. Not so sure I like the interior that much. While the seat was comfortable, it could use a better center console with real cupholders. For that kind of money I'd get a BMW or a Benz."
30,2013-03-28T16:55:35+00:00,qbrozen,Do you know which version it is?
31,2013-03-29T01:52:47+00:00,fintail,"Saw a white Tesla S today, probably one of the ones I've seen before. Also a couple of new Fusions with private plates, don't seem to be as rental-happy as before."
32,2013-03-29T12:30:43+00:00,iwant12,It's an S model. He said he checked off every box when he ordered it 4 months ago.
33,2013-03-29T12:58:17+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I've seen a few new Fusions as well. Still think the lower trim levels make the car look fat and droopy. Hard to explain but everytime I see one go by it looks like the thing is weighed down like they've got a full load of people when there's nobody actually in it!

I actually think I would spend a couple of bucks more and buy a Taurus instead :blush:"
34,2013-03-29T13:57:08+00:00,qbrozen,"The S is the model, but there are various levels of batteries and power. I was just curious because all the reviews so far have been of the top-of-the-line range/power version and I'd like to know more about the base version as far as real-world range and power. I'm actually not sure the base is available yet. That's the one that is supposed to start at something like $55k."
35,2013-03-29T15:03:36+00:00,fintail,"I've seen a surprising amount of hybrids.

For the Taurus, the facelift isn't bad."
36,2013-03-29T17:53:39+00:00,tifighter,The new Range Rover in white in the neighborhood. The tires look like rubber bands on those big rims...perfect for off-roading I'm sure.
37,2013-03-30T00:20:11+00:00,iwant12,"I think he paid around 90 for it. It's the Performance series. He said it could go 500 miles per charge, but the website says more like 265 miles per charge. I'll ask him again next time I see him what kind of mileage he's getting. The base (53 K) on the website says it achieves 160 miles per charge. Heck, I could drive to work, drive to the lake afterward, and back home easily on that."
38,2013-03-30T00:46:16+00:00,texases,"""He said it could go 500 miles per charge""

He's going to be sorely disappointed. Guess it's like 'that baby'll do 170' or 'yep, gets 70 mpg'..."
39,2013-03-30T03:02:34+00:00,fintail,"Saw a dirty dark colored Tesla sedan today, unplated, and a new SantaFe Sport with decent body damage down the passenger side."
40,2013-03-30T17:14:17+00:00,explorerx4,"Yesterday on the highway there were 2 black Range Rovers in front of me. While still in sight, another black Range Rover and a black Evoque passed me."
41,2013-03-30T21:18:17+00:00,explorerx4,I think the long wheel base and the lower body kit type style contribute to this.
42,2013-03-31T16:23:41+00:00,jpp75,"I've yet to see a Dart outside of rentals, kind of odd given how long it's been out."
43,2013-03-31T16:24:46+00:00,jpp75,"Saw a new MKZ yesterday, silver 2.0 Ecoboost. Not a bad looking car, but definitely not the car Lincoln needs to make a comeback, much less survive."
44,2013-03-31T16:33:11+00:00,jpp75,"I see a lot of new Fusions as well. The front is appealing but for me it's just too big, the back goes on forever. If I wasn't a car guy I would have picked up the last generation when they were trying to unload them for $7k off. Decent car for the money."
45,2013-04-01T01:13:36+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw an Audi A1, a first.

Then an older Skyline.

A new Hyundai minivan, not a 12 passenger model but not an Entourage either.

Mazda Demio, also. Lots of small cars and transport vans there, basically.

They drive on the left and that reminded me of my visits to Suriname."
46,2013-04-01T13:08:36+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Spotted my first, looked like a non X/T model with all the trimmings. I didn't realize they were on sale yet.

Also a gorgeous weekend brought out all the ""toys"" so a few Lexus IS convertibles, a couple of new Z4's, SLK's, a 911 Turbo Cabrio..."
47,2013-04-01T15:33:57+00:00,fintail,I'd have expected some exotics in a shady money hideout like the Caymans.
48,2013-04-01T17:43:32+00:00,ateixeira,"Only a couple, an older SL .... can't remember the others.

Saw tons of that in Miami on my way back. Probably drug money.

It is funny, though. ""World Headquarters"" with only 6 staff there."
49,2013-04-01T18:17:22+00:00,fintail,"Oh yeah, Miami is a paradise for untraceable money. When I was there last year, I saw more exotics on South Beach than I could count - and don't ask where the money comes from.

I would have expected Caymans to be like Switzerland in a way, but maybe just not enough of a road network to make a cool car fun."
0,2013-04-01T18:19:40+00:00,ateixeira,"You could get around the island in 5 minutes in an exotic.

I was impressed by the flow of the traffic circles. The USA could learn a bunch by studying traffic patterns there. Roads are busy yet you almost never stop.

Simple yet impressive."
1,2013-04-01T18:24:24+00:00,fintail,"I bet drivers licensing standards are higher, too. I have met people from South America, not known for high standards, who laugh at what goes on here."
2,2013-04-01T18:43:58+00:00,ateixeira,"I'm one of those people, LOL.

Though the Brazilian driving test may go too far in the other direction. They even include a mini psych evaluation.

I passed the test in a stick shift Beetle. Fusca down there."
3,2013-04-01T19:57:15+00:00,fintail,"And I am talking someone from Colombia, which seems to be a level less developed than Brazil. At least the motorcycle tests still require a little wherewithal.

On the new car front, was just out and saw a couple new Accords, Altima, Tesla, Equus (white with chrome wheels, which make the garishness less obvious)."
4,2013-04-01T20:38:38+00:00,ateixeira,"Saw a black one today, new decorated headlights."
5,2013-04-01T20:41:15+00:00,fintail,"New like 2014 facelift? Did it say E250? That would have to be one of the first on the continent, I was thinking they were still several weeks off."
6,2013-04-01T20:42:41+00:00,ateixeira,"I don't think so...maybe wasn't a diesel, then. Must've been a regular E350.

Will they have 2 diesel engine choices?"
7,2013-04-01T20:49:51+00:00,fintail,"But not a facelift? I haven't seen one of those yet.

I think E250 is it for 2014, and will now have available 4Matic."
8,2013-04-01T21:01:07+00:00,robr2,There is someone over in Tales from the Sales Front that is awaiting a 2014 E class which is due in the next 2-3 weeks so they may be out already.
9,2013-04-01T21:17:19+00:00,fintail,"I had heard end of the month, so that makes sense. Production started a couple months ago, and they have already been seen on the street in Europe/UK."
10,2013-04-02T14:14:00+00:00,ateixeira,"I must've seen a pre-production model. They're not common around here, but M-B sells a lot here and they sponsor all the big golfing events. I'm only a couple of miles from Avenel.

Talk about wealth...

Saw a light silver SLS today on M Street in Georgetown.

Now that I think about it, we saw an SLS in Miami, too. That's 2 in a span of 4 days."

Audi/VW are near here, in Northern VA, I think.

Then an RDX on the way in, seems more popular than the ILX. I think the big V6 and the extra space were a good idea.

Coming in - a new Accord, becoming ubiquitous.

Saw sales numbers and Nissan actually sold 100 more Altimas than Camrys sold. Then again price them and the Altima is priced more aggressively. Accord costs a bunch more. You wonder if Nissan is making any margin on those, or just making it up in volume."
14,2013-04-03T14:14:17+00:00,fintail,"I think RDX and MDX have to be the majority of Acura sales now.

Retail sales? Altima is a real fleet favorite these days, while a rental Accord is almost a unicorn."
15,2013-04-03T14:27:12+00:00,ateixeira,"Yup, RDX is #1 (up 285% YOWSAH!), MDX #2, and TL a close 3rd.

MDX is about to be replaced, though. This summer, they already showed it at NY. RDX has had eleventh-consecutive monthly sales records. American love the big V6 over the old thirsty turbo.

ILX outsold TSX, though I'd pick the latter no contest, especially the wagon.

Acura had a great month, up 26%."
16,2013-04-03T15:35:31+00:00,fintail,"I'd pick TSX too - ILX doesn't wow me, styling alone hurts it.

Maybe with the new RLX coming, sales could be up 26.01% :shades:"

18,2013-04-03T15:52:39+00:00,fintail,"The lights are so flamboyant while the rest of the car is bland. Odd mix.

No V8 might not a killer - the competitor V8s sell in very small numbers, maybe just a halo effect. FWD and super-sized Accord styling will hurt more."
21,2013-04-03T18:27:32+00:00,tifighter,I honestly don't think it offers $20K+ more than the Accord Touring. Which is also FWD with the high tech LED lights.
22,2013-04-03T18:43:33+00:00,boomchek,"I'm on a 3 week trip to Israel with my wife and son to see her family. An interesting mix of cars here from Europe, Japan, and the US.

Most popular and common brand here is Mazda, with a ton of Mazda 3's (mostly sedans), Mazda 6's, but interesting enough the last gen Mazda6 is a tiny bit smaller than the NA version. And I've seen a couple of the new new gen Mazda 6, including one wagon.

Next most popular has to be Hyundai, then Toyota (with a ton of Corollas), both Euro and NA spec Honda Civics, lots of euro Accords - our TSX.

Other notable brands here are ton of Fiats, Peugeots, Citroens, Renaults, Daihatsus, Mitsus, VW's, euro Fords, some Chevys, and surprisingly you see a newer Buick from time to time. Very few Benzes BMWs, or Audis here.

We have a rental euro spec Focus sedan - decent car but it's auto and I was hoping for something French or Italian, like a supermini hatch. Plus it seems gutless and I can't pop the hood to check the specs because the hood release has been removed for some reason :confuse:

Gas here is about $2/L (or about $7.50/gallon) so most cars are small and fuel efficient.

Plus car prices are higher than North America, and roads are rough, so car ownership here is very expensive.

A 2 year old Mazda 3 mid trim will run at about equivalent of $25k. Not cheap.

I'll post some pics up when I get back.

Cheers."

My guess is to prevent major pilferage, maybe even engine swapping. Kind of like when Hertz had a recent high performance Mustang, and put security wire on it to be able to check for engine swaps."

It was cold as hell but we took the train to the city, interesting enough station wagons in Amsterdam are as common as SUVs in North America. SUVs there on the other hand, are as common as wagons in North America, meaning very few.

- Spotted some of the BRZ-FRS club in Connecticut, maybe 6 or 7 of them lined up at a rest area.

- A few members from the Miata club about an hour later heading up 95

- New Acura RDX were a very common sight

Tesla Model S, Couple of Panamera's, latest Boxster S in screaming bright yellow, a few new RR's, new Foresters, XV Crosstreks, new SLK350, couple of new CLS's (one AMG :shades: )

I made the mistake of going down 95 to get there, what a miserable, congested and pot hole ridden disaster that was... My little Impreza took a beating on that road, especially on the Bronx Expressway where hitting a frost heave was like driving up over a sidewalk :sick: Going to take her in to check the alignment and suspension this week...

On the way out, we took the most gorgeous, smoothest 65 miles out via Rt 5? where doing 80mph was considered slow! I got passed by Mercedes after Audi after Bimmer, Lexus, Acura, Volvo like I was standing still. Felt like being back in Germany actually.

And the only cop I saw was one in one of those new G8/SS cop cars sitting in the island of an exit ramp with a busted wheel (rolled underneath) and lol you would think people would have slowed down when they saw him? Nope :surprise:

Needless to say, if you are going to head into the Big Apple, I highly recommend this route! I think it dumped us out around I684. near White Plains."

For that car, I would opt for the LE, most likely. Maybe even the hybrid version, which is surprisingly quick (better FE than Passat TDI and much quicker).

If I want something sporty, I'd get something else, most likely. The LE should offer a very comfortable ride and great NVH control. SE would add big rims and compromise both of those.

Though I like the new Accord more. Honda did a great job with the latest one. Altima would be tempting only for the seats and the 38mpg + large fuel tank = incredible range. I also like the Fusion and the hybrid version of that.

To be honest, though, I don't want a sedan."

This is a V6 but otherwise the same:"

I've owned an 09 and can tell you that while they weren't awful, they weren't great either. A bit short on the seat bottom and maybe a little too low. Sometimes over distance they could get to starting to feel lumpy or something as well, but fine for shorter distance driving. Actually, I'm not really sure I'm sold on the more angular outside styling of the '12 either, although I think that it is still pretty popular. I'm sure you could do a heck of a lot worse in a car though."

That narrowed it down pretty well.

Then he said he wanted a stick, but something well equipped. He got Juke SL loaded up with tech, but with a 6 speed manual, which forces FWD.

Most models force you into a CVT if you want all the tech toys. AWD is CVT only, too.

He's in TN and they get little snow.

Per TrueCar.com that's a $23k or so car. I dunno, I'd have gone for an Altima SV with Tech, but those don't come in stick.

I'm not a big fan of the Rogue, either. Blind spots are awful.

There's a very easy way to tell - pop the hood and look for an oil filter. The FB engines moved the filter to the top of the engine bay, super easy access. Bet I could change the oil in less than 5 minutes.

If I had one that is!

My brother's 2011 (?) model was the first year to get it, Outback got it the next year. Impreza got the FB20 with the redesign.

While we're de-coding Subaru engines, the FT86 models have the FA20, with the DI added. The H6 are called EZ36.

You will not see coolant leaking from a head gasket on an FB engine for one very simple reason - coolant no longer flows through the gasket. The head is cooled by separate lines."

Found a spot at Honda, browsed for a minute as I wanted to sit in a new Accord. Saw a base model in the showroom, 20K hangtag on it - seems like a bargain for that money.

I'm having a hard time convincing myself that I would need anything more than the new Accord, sport model. Lots of room, no sunroof, decent performance, good price..."
26,2013-04-29T16:56:28+00:00,ateixeira,"Sure does, and that lessens the appeal of the Genesis.

Remember when the J30 was out, and the Altima came and sort of stole its thunder? Same type of thing here.

Having said that, Genesis and Accord are both cars that feel more premium than their price points. That's not very common nowadays. Usually it's the other way around, questionable material quality for the cost.

Speak of the Devil, saw a new Accord in the garage just now, with a bra on the front. Had not seen one of those in a while."

I see the new Accord as evolutionary from the 08+ style, which seems related to the much tauter 90-93 style. Genesis to me looks something like a parallel universe BMW E60. Not a bad looking car, mind you."
30,2013-04-29T17:27:01+00:00,fintail,"I'd want the EX to at least get a few goodies (I like a sunroof) and would be hard pressed not to go EX-L, but it seems to offer a lot of content for the money either way. Accord, Fusion, and even Altima make the Camry look old."

Saw a new Forester on the road this morning, and spotted an E Bluetec parked at Whole Foods - I was thinking prissy princess wouldn't want to deal with diesel, but maybe hubby was sent to pick up that $9 loaf of bread."

34,2013-04-29T18:35:29+00:00,tjc78,"The problem with the Genesis will always be the fact it is a Hyundai. Let's face it, 44K is still premium money and many will run and grab an Inifinti G, Lexus ES, or a base TL for that same coin. I can say that on paper the Genesis is probably a better car than those above (and bigger) but many luxury buyers buy the name and not the car. How else can you explain BMW softening up their cars? All the people who bought them stepping up from Camrys, etc complained about the ride."
35,2013-04-29T18:37:58+00:00,ateixeira,"I looked at those, even drove one. You can get pano/leather/navi for low $22k range. Strong value proposition.

The catch is add $750 if you don't finance with Hyundai.

That'll only get you a base Accord. An EX-L Navi 4 banger would run ~$28k.

So that's about $5 grand more even if you don't qualify for the Hyundai finance incentive. And a small moonroof instead of pano.

You can get a better deal on an Altima, especially if you can live without leather. $24.7k for an SV with moonroof and navi, but you get cloth.

Of those 3 only the GT has the pano roof, though."

If Hyundai can build and sell the Equus under 70K, GM can build a full size RWD/V8 sedan and undercut the S-class price.

I see Lemko's point, Caddy needs an S, LS, 7 series type car. Right now, the XTS (while I really like it) is only competing with cars like Volvo S80 and Lincoln MKS.

Caddy doesn't have a ""flagship"" vehicle, even though their lineup is overall really nice IMO."

You have to time it right, when the market it on an upswing and it doesn't appear too politically incorrect. But GM could definitely use a halo car, and that's not a bad place to start."

I think they are more than huge enough, and I love having that much sidewall, considering how bombed out the roads are around here. and they look just right. and bigger would look goofy, and I don't feel the need for anything lower profile."
41,2013-05-07T14:36:15+00:00,lemko,"The Sixteen would elevate Cadillac to the exotic class! Now, that would be out of my range. It would be the equivalent of the $13K 1957 Eldorado Brougham. A ""regular"" Caddy cost less than half that price."

44,2013-05-07T18:26:42+00:00,tifighter,"Interesting; my first-gen RDX has 235/55/18's, so i guess they figured a little more sidewall wouldn't hurt the ride everyone originally complained about. I think they're right."
45,2013-05-07T19:57:14+00:00,fintail,"It's a fine line - they can't price it more than ze Ghermans, or it will flop. Really, can't cost more than a LS either. If need be, the car will have to be subsidized (like the first LS and no doubt the Korean entrants). It's about gaining acceptance and initial sales rather than making money. I don't know if the incompetent middle managerial ranks will be able to pull it off, or adopt the proper mindset and strategy.

It can't have the massive physical size of the Sixteen, but it can have some of the panache, and has to have world quality design and materials. There'd be a market for it IMO, especially with the still growing socio-economic chasm which has benefited the sub-exotic luxury market.. Also, there are places in the world outside of NA where people like American cars - I bet it would sell in Russia, Arabian peninsula, and China, too."

-Fiat 500C (Cabriolet) looking pretty spiffy in bright lemon yellow. I happened to be parked next to a Golf cart. It was bigger but not that much bigger The Fiat was pretty small next to my 330ciC (not a very big car).

Possibly as support vehicles.

The economy where I am right now isn't as strong as it is in some areas - no tech firms or crooked lobbyists/contractors/NGOs etc here. The Mustang is definitely a lot of bang for the buck.

Twas a Tesla. interesting to see it ""start"" up and drive away without making any noise.

This was in Jersey, in the philly burbs."

The female driver was acting like she stole it; she made 5 lane changes in less than a mile on the 5 lane interstate to take an east bound I70 ramp. The car had regular plates--not dealer plates.

I stopped at a local store with 2 Impalas on the lot. They were LT2 level cars. It was rainy and getting dark so I couldn't see inside very well.

Great looking car."

12,2013-05-13T18:47:14+00:00,cski,"Both the 500 and the Beetle are chic cars. I am not being prejudicial, just truthful. I see 500's all the time here in the DC are, and have never seen a man in one.

On the Beetle, I have only seen a few of them, (no men there either) and there is a VW dealer less than 4 miles from here! I bet their sales are not what WV had hoped. VW tried to ""butch up"" the Beetle with this new version, and they even have a funny commercial with three guys in ski masks driving one in winter.

See it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fuijhUn0pk

They show one of the guy's in a convenience store and upon getting to the counter with his snacks the store keeper, horrified; says ""I don't want any trouble"". The man gives him the cash and the three boneheads can hear police sirens as they leave the parking lot. One comments ""Did you forget to take the mask off?""LMAO."

Speaking of fleet sales and small cars, There is a new kind of car sharing/rental company in DC that uses Smart cars called car2go. https://washingtondc.car2go.com/ There are 1-3 of these white and blue cars on almost every block in the downtown area where I work.

The X1 looks noticeably smaller than the X3 in both length and height, in fact it looks to be about the same size as an E46 wagon. That's peachy with me since I'm an automotive minimalist. There seems to be a definite trend toward lower height in the current crop of CUVs but the X1 does have a significant gap between the tire and fender lip that detracts from it's looks IMO as does the big straight up grille (an attempt to give the X1 a ""trucky"" look?).

Otherwise I think it's pretty good looking inside and out."

So I browsed for a minute and sat in some cars. LX - big old tank, very comfortable, 90K MSRP. ES - smooth leather, a little tight for those 6' and above - roofline is too rakish. Current IS feels pretty old and isn't for taller people either. Didn't bother with an LS (2 in the showroom), did sit in a GS, this one had the striated metal trim that I like. Leather was soft and smooth - maybe too much so. The wide nav screen is nice, but somehow the metal seems thinner than on my E. A little more equipment for the same money. I noticed the GSs had hangtags with prices ~10% under MSRP - sales slowed. I think all cars in the building had added lojack/tint/chip protectant - maybe 2K worth of junk, not cool."

I was hoping that using the Avalon this go round would have helped that, but no dice. I just fit in my '96 ES w/o a sunroof, none of the later ones come that way, so it's a no-go for me. I'd claim they have the IS and GS to be 'rakish', but they didn't ask me..."

It was less expensive than the ES, but bigger. Now, it's smaller than the previous models, and rides hard. I don't get it, they killed their core audience IMO.

I also saw a new convertible 3er (E92) looking very spiffy in dark blue with the hardtop up.

Later I saw a Mini Roadster which looked nice despite being off-white but it occurred to me that I have seen very few of these tho they have been out for a while. I think people know instinctively that a two seat roadster should not be driven by the front wheels. Previous attempts at FWD roadsters haven't done well (Mercury Capri). If BMW/Mini were smart they'd turn the Mini drivetrain around and drop it behind the driver. An affordable mid-engined two-seater would fill a much better niche successfully exploited by the MR2 and (to a lesser extent) the X 1/9. They could call it the Mini Sprite :shades: ."

There are no twin-turbo powertrains, electronic gear selectors or eight-speed automatics. Instead, Chevy has stuck with what it knows best and improved just about every aspect of the Silverado, from hood to hitch.

I've seen more and more Volts the last few months actually being driven on the road for what looks like commuting use. Because they don't have the odd style of a Prius, I suspect a lot of Volts get overlooked by me when I'm out and about."
35,2013-06-09T23:46:24+00:00,fintail,"Went out car looking with a friend of mine. First to check out the Juke - instant no-go as all on the lot had manual seat with no lumbar, and apparently power seat with lumbar is not possible, per the salesman. Then to Volvo - he first wanted to see a C30 but they had no new ones and just 2 used base models in stock, then I recommended the S60. He liked that one a lot, especially the highline Platinum trim (49K MSRP, wonder what the lease is). Then to MB - for some reason he likes the GLK, test drove a CPO one - he likes the size, I told him to wait for the diesel. Saw a nicely equipped 14 E350 wagon in the showroom along with a few 14 E sedans, and a 699 lease on a C63. Walked through the Bentley lot, saw everything from base 180K Continentals to a 360K+ Mulsanne. Jaguar lot is adjacent, saw an F-Type, 104K sticker."
36,2013-06-10T02:51:07+00:00,berri,"Tell your friend if he wants a Volvo or Jaguar, better strike pretty soon. I don't imagine it will be all that long before their Chinese owners move production all over to mainland China. Yeah, I'll sure want to plop down a wad of cash for Chinese quality!!!"
37,2013-06-10T04:11:14+00:00,fintail,"Jag is Indian, IIRC. But Chinese or Indian production for either would kill them in the developed world. Part of the image for both is where they are made. I'll freely admit I'd be hesitant to buy a Volvo right now just because I don't really want to support Chinese ownership. Kind of the shame as the cars still seem nice enough (S60 is assembled in Belgium, I think)."
38,2013-06-10T15:52:53+00:00,berri,"I think you're right about India and Jag. Not good to confuse those two countries - I think they pretty much dislike each other!

I saw some Volvo's at an auto show this past winter. One thing stuck me though. They all had cream colored leather interiors and all of the driver's seats seemed to already have stains from blue jeans getting in and out of them. The Volvo's did seem to be priced competitively for their segment though. I think the seats grabbed my attention because it was just down a bit from Lincoln that also had that creme leather thing going. Those didn't have the rubs or stains. They both seem to me as similar mid tier brands; not lux, but a cut above Toyota, Ford, etc. So it was kind of interesting, especially since ford isn't really known for quality leather seating."
39,2013-06-10T17:42:36+00:00,fintail,"At least India isn't engaging in actions that try to undermine the US, not that I know of at least. I still don't want a car from those areas anyway.

That Volvo sounds like the interior needed some kind of treatment or protectant. That's a big risk with light interiors. The S60 seems to be at C-class pricing, but offer maybe a third more size. They can be loaded up to 50K, but you can get a base closer to 30K, and it is pretty base. However, brand cachet comes into play, and that's where the battle becomes difficult.

Maybe it's just me, but for a non super-lux car, I have no problem with a passable pleather interior. Nothing wrong with MB-Tex, most people can't tell the difference between it and a standard leather anyway. The base leather in some Asian and American models is nothing to brag about.

Depending on what one reads, it was either designed by Opel or GM Korea led the development with a major assist from Opel. In any case - it's really a global platform as the Cruze is sold worldwide virtually unchanged."

On the outside, it has a nice stance and the lines are nice. This one was decked out in what Kia calls Acura black? hmmmmmm, wonder who they were targeting? Anyways, very nice car.

You'll have to excuse me while I go burn the old C&D and MT magazines that contained reviews on the original Sportage and Sephia. Those cars have nothing to do with what Kia is building today."

Tho I'm not as confident about the drivetrain plus really having no real seat time, I can't say how the Cadenza would match up against Acura's new RLX but with regards to features, comfort and interior/exterior quality I'd say the big Kia would be a good match for it."

Am totally in love with the Buick Verano and if I were going to replace my current ride, that would be on my short list.

GM did an exceptional job here and should be commended. Am very excited about getting one in the fall or winter for a trip to Orlando or Tampa...want to get some seat time in one to really see how good the vehicle is. On this same note, I'm not a lover of larger vehicles but the new Tahoe's we've driven lately have been very nice drivers and it's time for GM to do their magic and bring it into the 21st century. And first thing they need to do is get rid of that ridiculously wimpy steering wheel, hell, even the Chrysler 200 has a nicer and meatier wheel to hold on to! A small complaint I know but it's something that has to be used daily and to me, it's those little touches that really make or break a vehicle...that attention to the tiniest detail no matter how inconsequential it may be. I guess that's what puts the luxury brands above the mainstream ones, it's their attention to detail to make even the smallest thing a work of art. I guess there's no one perfect vehicle out there but some of these guys are pretty close! Just hope that on my next vehicle I can get some of that refinement for myself!

He's an actual enthusiast - drives a similar Bluetec to mine, also has an old 911S, has had W126 and W116 - I like to see things like that. Lexus dealer had maybe 15x new IS, all but one a non-F-sport, only saw one IS350. BMW had a 7er with a white interior (not creme, not platinum - white), and an M6 Gran Coupe MSRP 126K. Also an active hybrid 3er with MSRP a couple hundred bucks shy of 60K - that's almost the cost of my E. Toyota dealer had an Avalon with zero options, must be unusual - and a metric ton of 4Runners."

Definitely cheap, but it was smooth and quiet enough, dual AC worked well, seemed to be put together just fine. Sliding doors had power windows, which is something not seen back when I was a kid riding in minivans. A very honest vehicle.

I also saw a new Boxster driven by an old couple - looked to be in their 80s anyway. It looked highly optioned, and was a blinding kind of electric blue color. The old guy was watching me as I slowly jogged by (warm day), I think hoping that I would give it a stare, so I obliged and nodded."

Also spotted and R8 V10, an XK-R and a mint condition early NSX that looked like it just rolled off the showroom floor.

And one that I wonder if the resident GM fans can answer. It was one of the current Sierra pickups in blue that looked like it was well cared for but the underside had a ridiculous amount of rust. I was behind it on the highway and the rear axles was completely brown, the shock mounts were covered, the U-brackets, the brakes. Then passed around the side of it and the frame was full of rust as well, not full but the welds, sections of the chassi... this thing was a bucket. :sick:

My buddy had rust problems on one of his lemons back in 2006 but the rust on that thing was confined to the bumpers and the spare tire well. This thing looked like it had been sitting in a salt bath for it's life."

Unfortunately, the large sedan is a shrinking market I'm afraid. I think if GM had put that kind of styling effort into the Malibu they'd have a home run on their hands. It gives me some hope that GM might be starting to return to it's former styling leadership! I guess time will tell the story one way or the other."

Oh, they even had a couple of Volts as well.

I was kind of disappointed because it could have given me a chance to view one up close without having to deal with going to a dealer and getting the runaround...

Probably because the Impalas are at the airport location. Boston is in full tourist mode at this time of year and the hotel locations are geared toward residents renting for the day or weekend."

We drove one up to West Palm yesterday, an LTZ unit, and it is a looker but the interior is still a disappointment unfortunately. It drives well enough but it's really dated compared to the new Sonata I also drove yesterday...it just feels so old school. If GM just gets all the pieces to fit, it could give the Accord and others a good run for the $ as there are many folks who want to purchase American and the Buick Regal being a bit to expensive.

GM knows what they have to do and I know they will step up to the plate with the next generation Malibu.

The XTS is not intended to be Caddy's flagship, that will likely be a sedan versionof the Emiraj concept car and will be V8-powered and RWD/AWD.

36,2013-10-02T20:45:30+00:00,ateixeira,I always felt like getting rid of Maybach would let Benz be all it could be. Look how sweet they look now...
37,2013-10-02T20:46:28+00:00,ateixeira,"Still have not grown on me, wow these are just painful to look at.

The trunk looks like it needs to be about 2 feet longer to look acceptable."
38,2013-10-02T21:50:46+00:00,fintail,"The new S does seem to be 80% of a Maybach for 30% the cost. It was an odd experiment.

5er GT...I wonder if most we see are 2010 models, can't imagine they sell many now that they aren't a novelty."
39,2013-10-02T21:52:02+00:00,fintail,I wonder how many Altimas are rentals - seems half the rental cars on the road here are Nissans.
40,2013-10-03T02:15:45+00:00,fintail,Saw a red CLA in traffic today. Looked small.
41,2013-10-03T02:59:36+00:00,berri,"I think that's been true for awhile. Nissan's at the majors, but Chrysler 200 / Avenger's at the cheapies. Ironically, around here at least, it seems like Nissan dealers offer some of the crappiest deals. Doesn't make sense to me to push rental cars over retail sales, nor why one would pay more for comparable Altima versus so many other nice alternatives."
42,2013-10-03T16:56:24+00:00,ateixeira,"Altima is interesting - in certain colors is looks awful, but in other colors it works. There are some odd creases in that design.

Then again they got a 38mpg highway rating so I'm sure form followed function."
43,2013-10-03T17:56:20+00:00,texases,"""There are some odd creases in that design. ""

Nissan and Infiniti are leading the way with 'odd creases' in lots of their designs. BMW's not far behind..."
44,2013-10-03T18:08:14+00:00,ateixeira,"But in some colors is looks totally fine, even attractive. So strange.

Nissan is hit or miss in terms of design. I like the Versa Note, but not the sedan (at all). The Juke is ugly but the Cube is unique. I don't like the Rogue or Murano much, but the Pathfinder works. Max and Sentra also seem fine.

Not a whole lot of family resemblance except maybe the big sedans."
45,2013-10-03T18:29:07+00:00,fintail,"The new Sentra seems to be what the Altima was 20 years ago.

And the Altima...maybe a 21st century Cutlass Ciera.

Pathfinder would be fine as a smaller minivan and a suitable name."
46,2013-10-03T18:33:13+00:00,ateixeira,"Sentra's back seat is HUGE. It really stands out. Significantly roomier than the Malibu, which is supposed to be one size up.

I haven't driven one but reviews are really disappointing, no one seems to like the way it drives.

Altima is more well liked. Big fuel tank + 38mpg = range of a diesel without the cost.

I'd be more interested in a Versa Note if they put a decent powertrain in that thing. Maybe a bigger fuel tank, as well.

Pathfinder sales are through the roof. They should just have given it a different name. Sure looks better than the bolt-upright Quest!"
47,2013-10-03T19:24:11+00:00,fintail,"I'd still lean towards Accord vs Altima, simply for aesthetics.

Most Quest and many new Pathfinder I see in my area have a rental barcode. The latter could be renamed the Mallfinder, for its demographic and off road prowess. Funny how it changed from a competent enough, if old looking, small SUV."
48,2013-10-03T19:45:22+00:00,ateixeira,"Same, I like the Genesis (you probably know that) and the Accord reminds me of the Genesis.

Honda's packaging is also a little better, base Altimas come with cheap wheel covers, and no backup cam either. Add that stuff and the Accord's a better value.

Pathfinder seems to change every generation, radically so. From unibody to body on frame, and back. More than once. What does the name stand for? It has an identity crisis.

No one bought the truck, and people line up for the psuedo-minivan. A neighbor bought one to replace an MDX. They used to complain about premium fuel cost so I'm sure fuel costs were a major factor."
49,2013-10-03T19:58:31+00:00,berri,""" MDX. They used to complain about premium fuel cost ""

I understand the 2014 MDX still does even though the latter Lexus RX crossovers don't. I don't understand that logic at Honda. Around here at least, premium is almost 50 cents/gallon higher. But then I'm a bit leery even on the Pilot because there seem to still be issues with the V6 engine cylinder deactivation system and consuming oil."
0,2013-10-03T21:01:48+00:00,stickguy,"big debate on the RDX forums. I have used regular and could not tell the difference. it is not required now, just recommended.

I think it is a marketing deal as much as anything (luxury cars are supposed to use premium, right?)"
1,2013-10-03T21:07:04+00:00,texases,"My ES300 'recommended' premium, even though it had the identical engine as the V6 Camry, which recommended regular. Same for the RX and the Highlander. I used regular, never had a problem.

With Acura there area some differences between their engines and the Honda versions, aren't there?"
2,2013-10-03T21:08:31+00:00,stickguy,"minimal at best I think. and if there are, probably at the upper range of the tach where I never usually go!

if the CR is the same on the Accord and RDX (I think they share the engine) than I really doubt it."
3,2013-10-03T21:17:58+00:00,texases,"Take the Pilot and MDX:
Pilot's 3.5 l puts out 250 hp, 10.5:1 CR
MDX's 3.7 l puts out 300 hp, 11.2:1 CR

So there's a basic difference for those two."
4,2013-10-03T22:10:58+00:00,fintail,"I'd like a revised Genesis more - the current one is getting long in the tooth. The Accord is similar, lots of BMW hints in their styling. Oh those designers. Accord is probably the best value in its class right now, a mainstream car I'd actually consider.

Pathfinders traditionally have been very old when finally changed, no surprise sales were weak. Now it's another glorified minivan pretending to be butch...perfect for these times, I guess.

For something like a RDX. premium might be recommended, but that's not a performance engine. It'll do fine with regular, maybe put the good stuff in on a rare day for fun. For a tuned or high output engine, then go for premium."
5,2013-10-04T00:52:00+00:00,Sandman6472,"Saw a new '14 Corolla on the road today in white...meh, pretty plain Jane folks especially in white...think we'll pass. Got to drive some interesting rentals a few days ago. A new Pathfinder but the tranny was screwy and I had to take it back to the dealer for Sixt...when it got up to 40 and I let off the gas pedal, it shook and shaked violently, a real nasty drive so it was sent back for a look see at the cvt. Drove a black ML350 to the dealer for an oil change and wow, what a vehicle...just awesome. Then I had a Bug going back to the dealer for some work and it wasn't that bad actually.

Had eye surgery on Wednesday but going back to work tomorrow...I won't have to wear glasses anymore for my myopia...it is gone as is the astigmatism. Took a couple days off to recuperate.

My neighbor bought one of the first new Pathy's and had theirs replaced under a TSB before the actual recall was announced. Since then, she says the thing drives like a dream and hasn't had an issue since (Something like only 7000 miles but still)."

I think they have tweaked the styling and features over the years, but the current one dates to something like 2009 IIRC. I have seen quite a few of the new ones tho, easily identifiable with the rear chrome treatment on the lower bumper...

Ironically, I work with a gentleman who is still driving a 98' ML350 with something like 300k on it. It's needed a bunch of different things over the years and it's got some rust on various sections of the body but he says the overall vehicle is a tank and he won't get rid of it ""till it stops moving under it's own power""..."

I find these, (as well as the XC60) to be some of the sexiest cars in their respective class, a smidge moreso than the new Infiniti Q and way more than 3-series. I drove one back in 2012 and despite being a front-biased driver, the thing was an absolute hoot to drive and stupid quick...

I test drove the old one when it first came out. M-B had an event at FedEx Field. I have to figure out why they dropped me off their mailing list, because I didn't get an invite for the new launch. LOL

Did it get the new, smaller diesel? May be better to keep the big one since those might actually haul/tow a little."

The ML looks a lot better than the GLK to my eyes, but I'm not shopping for either, really.

$44k plus per cargurus for the GLK250 diesel .... I'd either spend more and get the ML or spend a lot less and get a different box.

A new vehicle should not act like this as Nissan has used CVT's for awhile now and the bugs should have been gone long ago. Just look at the new Accord...no complaints that I've heard about their CVT tranny but maybe they have just handled any problems with minimal reporting to the auto press. Either way, I'd hope Nissan would've compensated folks with a couple of free oil changes or something for the hassle of going through this ordeal...give the customer something of value to make up for this weird experience!

It's pretty impressive - like a mini-Maybach in a way, especially the rear seating, which is pretty decadent. This one was a corporate demo with no sticker - so I couldn't get the full option list - but I could see it had pano, distronic, sport, AMG wheels, fancy stereo, and the rear seating might be part of a package too. MSRP on this one supposed to be ~120K. Also saw someone taking delivery of a red CLA. Dealer has some E250s on their website, but none on the lot."

Also saw a new CLA but was totally underwhelmed, guess I still think the C Class is the nicest one of them all. Don't get me wrong, I'd drive one in a second but I'd prefer the C if I did have a choice. But doubt that will ever happen since I don't think I could, or would spend that much on a vehicle. I think $20k or a little above would be the highest I would ever spend on a depreciating asset. But one never knows what could happen in the right situation...all I do know is that I am going a bit more lux with the next vehicle no matter what. We even discussed that today over lunch and I got no resistance what so ever except that whatever I do end up getting, the wife will be able to drive it when she wants to so I kinda said...o k. Since we have different driving styles, I am a bit hesitant to let her drive my Civic as that constant on and off the gas pedal just drives me nuts and wastes so much petrol...I prefer a constant pressure with my right foot at all times and a smoother drive at all times. But I've always disliked whenever someone, even the kids, drove my vehicle as I like things a certain way and hate when things are ""changed"". I even hate it when someone looks into my closet or drawers without me being around...a personal flaw I know but I am a bit protective of my stuff.

You're correct, it is a Suzuki, not a Subaru.

That's a clone of the compact GM pickups.

That part turns out not to be correct. Quoting from Wikipedia:

The Suzuki Equator is a mid-size pickup truck based on the Nissan Frontier and assembled by Nissan.

...

Sales of the Suzuki Equator since 2009 have been 5,808 overall, and it rarely sells over 200 units per month.


Easy to understand why I've never seen one before."
16,2013-10-15T12:24:09+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Nothing really special about them IMO, but they seem to be selling rather well already. Already as common a sighting as the new RAV4...

Reworked XC60, I like the subtle changes like the integrated exhaust and a sleek new Mahogany color.

Spotted a few more Model S's in Providence, RI area."
17,2013-10-15T12:33:18+00:00,anythngbutgm,Also saw a new Tundra with MA plates (sold) and another out for a test drive. The looks of it aren't as bad as the pictures and for some reason the paint and chrome work I found very rich. It's a pretty classy looking rig IMO...

Nicer than the Azera twin.

Also saw a Versa Note. I like it better than the sedan, and much better than the old hatch. All it needs is the Juke's powertrain and it would be a cute little hot hatch."

Q50 in a gun-metal grey color, looking better and better each time. It's a nice update IMO.

Green Corolla, base model, hubcaps...

A couple of new RLX's and Cadenzas, I think the Cadenza is nicer."

29,2013-10-21T19:48:03+00:00,explorerx4,"I saw a new RLX yesterday, too.
Very plain with some strange styling.
Quad exhaust pipe, but they were hidden and there were these bright sliver trim pieces in the bottom corners of the rear bumper.
It looked like they changed their mind about the exhaust styling at the last minute and eliminated the through the bumper style.
Rear lights looked cheap, too."
30,2013-10-21T19:51:40+00:00,explorerx4,"It looks like they literally added a drive train to the front of an 8x12 cargo trailer.

31,2013-10-21T19:54:27+00:00,fintail,"It's like a 4:3 scale Accord. I don't understand that car.

On the new car note, I spotted an E250 Bluetec sitting on the local lot, so I had to stop by and have it started so I could hear it. There's definitely a minor amount of more noise, but I don't mind that. EPA highway mpg estimate is 10 more than the V6 - with 4Matic no less. I am very curious about this car.

Shots of the 2015 C-class interior have been officially released, too - a mix of good and bad. I like the upmarket HVAC controls, dislike the static tablet style screen."
32,2013-10-21T20:05:48+00:00,ateixeira,"That looks like my custom setup on my van - my Magellan actually resembles that and sits in the same position, at the top/center of the dash.

It does look tacked on but they needed a lot of space, and being closer to the driver should help make the maps legible. I'm sure M-B will use a sharp, HD display."
33,2013-10-21T20:09:21+00:00,explorerx4,Parked on pedestals outside an assembly plant in Toledo.
34,2013-10-21T20:13:39+00:00,fintail,"It'll be a nice big screen anyway. Maybe I will warm up to it. A HD display might make it worth it. The current display, although the interface is far from the most efficient, is still one of the best at any price point.

When I went to look at the E, salesman (who is an enthusiast) dropped a hint that a C wagon might be coming. C250 diesel 4Matic wagon would have me buying instead of leasing."
35,2013-10-21T20:18:18+00:00,ateixeira,"The execution will be so important...done well it could be eye candy. A low quality pixelated display would be an eye sore.

I wouldn't mind that smaller diesel engine given my GPS says my average speed is a whopping 22 mph in DC traffic. It used to be 20mph so I changed my commute path to a longer, more scenic route.

I had a C wagon loaner once, from a Subaru dealer, of all places. Made me scratch my head as Fitz doesn't have an M-B franchise."
36,2013-10-21T20:52:24+00:00,texases,Hope thieves don't think it's removable...
37,2013-10-21T21:09:45+00:00,fintail,"I wonder if it's the same unit from the CLA. I haven't seen one operate in person.

The smaller unit will return better mpg overall. I can average around 40 on the highway, but in my sub-20mph commute, am usually down around 23-25.

The C wagon seemed to have a following the few short years it was here, but I guess soft roader profit margins are higher."
38,2013-10-21T21:09:45+00:00,stever,Didn't even notice the model of car but there's a Tom Tom camera car cruising around the UP right now.
39,2013-10-21T21:10:47+00:00,fintail,"I've thought of that too. BMW is using a similar design in some models as well. At least the Audi screen retracts (although once the car gets old, who knows)."
40,2013-10-22T18:17:09+00:00,fintail,"Saw another new Corolla today - they'll sell by the boatload. That wheel gap. Design reminds me of a heavily decontended Chinese version of a Lexus IS, somehow."
41,2013-10-22T18:23:58+00:00,robr2,I saw a Corolla myself this AM. It was parked in my neighbor's driveway. Recent college grad must have gotten a job - at least she was smart enough to get a Corolla rather than leasing a 3/C/IS like many feel the need to do while living at home.
42,2013-10-22T18:40:07+00:00,ateixeira,"Base has 15"" steelies, but the S comes with 17"" rims. They must be leaving room for those? Wheel sizes have just gotten silly.

I remember the day Chevy announced 17""s would be available on the Corvette, LOL."
43,2013-10-22T18:42:25+00:00,fintail,"Of course, the Corolla easily could be a lease too. With subsidized highline leases, the payment might not be much different. Like the kids say, yolo"
44,2013-10-22T18:45:00+00:00,fintail,"Even with 17s, it might be noticeable (and the Corolla S continues to make me snicker). The one I saw was definitely a base car. The cars around it were a Sonata and an old RL, both of which looked like lowriders in comparison. Makes a Mazda 3 look that much more appealing.

I remember looking at a Rolls Royce in a showroom about 10 years ago, it had 19"" wheels - they seemed like something off a truck."

Knowing this family, it's probably not a lease.

And if it were, leases on 2014 Corollas are as low as $159 a month. At that price, I'd consider leasing!!"
46,2013-10-22T19:00:00+00:00,fintail,"Maybe the car was a gift from mommy and daddy then, to go along with the no doubt free ride in school and housing.

A new XC60 in a really sharp Mahogany color, second one I've seen and it's really vibrant. The new S60 and XC60 have had some subtle but classy revisions this year. I like.

Co-worker of mine actually bought a new Mitsubushi Mirage. My gosh it's tiny. I'm not sure if I was shocked at seeing 14"" rims on a model circa 2014 or the styling that looks circa 2004... Even in white it just looks so dorky. Still she is getting 45mpg currently in mixed driving and that's with less than 1000 miles. I guess if your on a budget...

Great color and I liked the lines of the car...interior was pretty neat looking though I didn't care for the light brown interior, looks like it will show all the dirt that cars pick up. Looks like a 3/4 Camry which isn't a bad thing and it definitely looks better than the Civic, so much better! I think Toyota will move a bunch of these puppies over the next few years though when I went to their website, the nicer versions are getting a bit pricey. Probably best to wait awhile to purchase so the market place can settle the prices at their correct levels. But that green color really made me stand up and notice this vehicle as I don't think I've seen this color from any other make yet. Toyota took a big gamble here...and I think it is going to pay off nicely for them!

He is somewhere in him mid-40s at least with a couple of early teen boys. Daily driver is a 2010 or so Stang GT in burgundy, and he already has a C4 Vette in the garage that I have not seen him drive in ages. So not sure what this odditiy is for!"

Not quite sure how well the new Corolla will do as I still don't see that many on the road. I still think that Honda has lost it's way in this segment and just needs to shrink the new Accord to 3/4 size and they'd have a home run on their hands!
Was looking at Autotrader and found a local cool ride, a drop top, right down the street and am planning to take a run over there and check it out. It's the perfect color combo though it's a slush box but for me, that's perfect. It has some miles though, 88.3k, but for a toy I don't think that's totally terrible. It's a 2005 325Ci drop top in a stellar gray over gray combo and I am going to go over tomorrow to take a gander just to see. I know the misses would go nuts if I brought this puppy home but I think in time, she would absolutely love it and even drive it to be honest. By doing this, I could split my miles between it and the Civic and just keep the Civic longer cause it really is so cheap to keep and it's paid for. I can pay cash for this one also and they're asking $11,495 but who knows how long it has sat on their lot. Bet if I offered them $10.4k they'd probably take it but would love to start down around $10k and come up a bit. Doubt they have a line of folks wanting this puppy as the color combo might not be everyone's favorite, seems black or white does a lot better down south here for some reason. Saw it earlier on Autotrader and it was calling to me for some reason...it is calling my name! And how much fun it could be for all of us to!

If Ford could fix the problems with their computer systems and the crazy auto tranny in the Focus, they could be even more successful but I dislike every Focus I drive due to that tranny, just isn't as smooth as other vehicles.

Was unimpressed with the seats though as my spine was pretty soar after the couple of hours it took to get to the airport. All the controls were where they needed to be and it was easy to use my flash drive in the audio system...sound was o k also. Not sure if I'd purchase one when compared to the competition but it was a nice vehicle.
Drove a Ford Explorer on my second trip and liked it much better and the seat had more padding where I needed it. Again, the flash drive paired nicely with the system though the controls and instructions were a bit confusing at first. Think after some study, things would become more intuitive. Vehicle drove very nicely especially in the pouring rain and I chose it because of the lousy weather...I enjoyed it a lot!
There was an Enclave but someone else grabbed it first but hopefully I will get a chance to drive a lot of vehicles. We did these jobs for Avis yesterday and they had all the vehicles in a certain area and we got to choose any that had keys and a full tank of gas. Great way to do things for a change and hopefully we will work for Avis more in the future. I think this new company and I will get along great!

Black, naturally and I think an improvement over the current model but still not as regal as the top-of-the-line Merc should be IMO.

Up until today I think I've seen maybe two or three Audi R8s outside of car shows but today I saw two. Both were white, one with a silver ""sail"" , the other with a black one and some lettering from a custom body shop. IMHO white does nothing to enhance the looks of a high dollar car, especially not a sports car, it sucks all the drama out of the shape.

Last but not least, I saw a new BMW 650i Gran Coupe, a nice looking car (white again!) but no prettier IMO than it's Five series equivalent which cost 8 or 10K less IIRC.

Another rarely seen car showed up twice on my radar today, the Porsche Panamera, One was white, the other silver, both seen a few feet apart in a restaurant parking lot. I realize it's a minority opinion but I like Porsche's 4-door sedan, it even looks good in white, at least to me."

We seem to be so much alike especially with our car favorites and all and I think the new Hyundai/Kia products are the best they've ever been and can compete with the big boys now. Heck, I even dumped a Honda for a Hyundai and I am very pleased right now. I really wanted to like the ILX but seriously, it's just a gussied up Honda Civic...just like putting lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig! Nice enough vehicle but the price premium just wasn't worth it in my opinion. I think for the same money, there are s many better choices out there. And trust me, I looked and we all saw how I was all over the place with my search...I looked from A to Z and considered a lot of vehicles. Luckily my job helped me see what the many options were...and still are. That Ford C Max I drive Thursday would've been a great d d and I really loved the Lexus CT...and don't forget I started out looking for a convertible toy for myself!

And that dark grey one is still sitting at the dealer, hard to believe. They did put a newer Limited as the ""managers special"" in the pre-owned section yesterday morning with the leather and it truly was a nice vehicle, that light sandstone color and it still had the dealer plate on it. Think they were just fishing it out there as obviously a salesman or manager is using it as a demo or whatever. I asked if they had any demos for sale but was told no...demos are a good choice if they knock enough off the price and the mileage isn't much above the 3k mark. Basically a new vehicle but sold at some discount for the used mileage, a great choice depending on the vehicle and deal. Lots of folks, like Suze Orman, really like the pre-owned vehicles to save some on the depreciation but only the Buick store was going to have a couple of demos...soon.
Wife just drove it home from the library and complained about it like I thought she would but she finally admitted it drove very nicely! Yay! But she did say that in a few years I'll be loping for something to replace it and told her doubtful about that. Not going to go through this stuff for awhile as it does take a lot of work to research, test drive and deal with the dealerships and their sometimes ""smooth"" operators. The majority were pretty good but the ""what will it take to get you to drive this home tonight"" guys left me cold and I eventually walked away from their deals...the lady with the no pressure won my business through that and her product knowledge, something that really surprised me. This woman knew her Hyundai product line which is a must in my book, know your product line so when the customer asks a question or has an issue, it gets answered or corrected the first time. This is exactly my experience with her and she would get all ""11's"" if such were allowed. Hopefully a survey will be mailed to me so I can give her all 10's for a job well done. Now if she had gone to bat for me to have swapped out the alloys or given me the free oil change I asked for, well that would've been better for me and for her but I won't hold it against her as she did know her product line!

He scoffed at the idea (""I don't want a Hyundai""). Quite the snob for a kid just out of school, still looking for a career-track job!

The ILX though seems way different than the new Civic. Especially the interior. No way I would get a Civic. And the GT Elantra, once you add the key options (power heated leather, moonroof) stickers for close to an ILX.

the ILX lease out right now also has about 2.5K discount (25.5 cap cost off of a 28K MSRP.

we could do a sign and drive (just DMV fees down) on an ILX for just under $300/mo (for 35 months), with 12K/year. So not really that much more than the cost to lease a strippo model which is usually what you see touted in the lease ads."

Too bad your kid is such a car snob as my kids were thrilled to get the keys to their Accent and Versa...sure the younger one wanted the Mini but she knows that will come in time and we decided that as their 1st vehicles, what we got them was just perfect as we did have to stay on budget since we bought them both within a 2 month period. Luckily they were both thankful for what they could get and still like them both.
As of now, the Mazda is going to stay until the '15 models come out if possible and she'll look at the Accent and Mazda3. She even brought up the idea of her having taken over the Civic and me selling the Mazda but I know last Sunday she would have refused that idea and she even admitted she didn't really want my Civic but that would've been the best scenario...would've cost me a bit more but would've been well worth it. Oh well, best she gets what she wants, when she wants and as you know with your own wife and the RDX, happy wife, happy life! So, as long as the a/c still works, we are good to go. And told her when she's ready, find your exact vehicle and then call me in to test drive it and then sit down with you and the dealer to negotiate. She balked at this but I convinced her to do it my way next time as I think I can get her a better price by using this site and all it's knowledgeable folks plus the other sites I know of to get her the best and fairest possible deal. All I want is for her to be happy with the vehicle and the price she will pay. End of story.

18,2013-12-21T01:32:34+00:00,lemko,Spotted one of those weird Nissan Murano convertibles on Rhawn near Palmetto in NE Philly.
19,2013-12-21T01:42:43+00:00,PF_Flyer,"Like most convertibles, I like the look of it much better with the top down. (not that you can really do that much in NE Philly in Dec:) )"
20,2013-12-21T11:12:56+00:00,tjc78,This weekend that may be a possibility! They are calling for 70 on Sunday. It's crazy.
21,2013-12-21T14:48:24+00:00,PF_Flyer,Snapping cold right behind that so don't leave the top down too long!
22,2013-12-23T17:43:04+00:00,tjc78,Caprice Interceptors.... 5 of them convoy style on RT70 in Cherry Hill appeared to be a delivery to some municipality (all were dealer plated). I bet a retired one wouldn't be a bad DD.
23,2013-12-23T19:02:09+00:00,fintail,"Saw a CLA, A7, and Allroad on a transporter today."
24,2013-12-23T22:18:45+00:00,fintail,"Went to the car wash operated by the dealer group where I bought my car (nice perk), saw a couple of CLA there, and an oddity - 2014 E250 Bluetec luxury trim with pano, pearl white. Little old lady driving it, who had the headrests up way too high.
Stopped by the dealer to get my tires aired up, as my gauge died. Saw a new S-class waiting in the back. Saw another new S-class on the road near home."
25,2013-12-23T22:34:49+00:00,lemko,Spotted a really nice black Mercedes E-Class wagon on Terwood Road in Huntingdon Valley outside of Philly.
26,2013-12-24T01:19:50+00:00,fintail,"Just a few minutes ago, another new S-class drove by my window - looks like the market is accepting the car, and some people are doing pretty well."
27,2013-12-24T18:50:27+00:00,stickguy,"first in the wild that I remember, a new Santa Fe (the ""big"" 3 row model)."
28,2013-12-24T18:55:07+00:00,fintail,Saw a new Range Rover and a GL63 this morning.
29,2013-12-24T19:25:05+00:00,PF_Flyer,"Once I get out of the house today, I'm CERTAIN I'll see some folks who got new rides for Christmas. It always seems to happen right around this time of year"
30,2013-12-27T22:46:04+00:00,fintail,"Saw a truckload of new Teslas heading north on I5 today between Seattle and Portland, probably bound for Bellevue."
31,2013-12-28T01:39:07+00:00,andys120,"No 'Vettes to see...
I wonder how many of you have seen the 2014 Corvette but I sure haven't. The new Sting Ray represents the most radical design change since the original was released in '63 and frankly I'm at sixes and sevens about the styling based on photos I've seen but then I didn't like the '63 until I saw them in person and I've found over the years that you can't tell from photos if you'll like a car's looks.
I was going by a huge Chebby dealer this weekend so I pulled in to see if they had one. I was told they are sold before they even get there and so,they're all spoken for and leave as soon as they arrive. I was a little nonplussed to find that so many people would buy such an expensive car sight unseen and even more important, undriven."
32,2013-12-28T01:54:39+00:00,texases,"It's gotten such rave reviews that the 'Vette faithful will buy it up, and those waiting for a 'Vette with good seats will, too..."
33,2013-12-28T03:39:11+00:00,fintail,"I've seen two. I think it's a nice update, kind of exotic looking - which it needs to be IMO."
34,2013-12-28T15:01:36+00:00,PF_Flyer,"Saw a new Kia Soul today... with an off center racing stripe, white side mirrors, and white wheels. No hamsters"
35,2013-12-28T15:19:59+00:00,kyfdx,"I saw a truckload of new Vettes awhile back.. all had those ugly chrome wheels. Last Sunday, saw one parked on a downtown street.. nice silver wheels and a color that was pretty close to BRG."
36,2013-12-28T17:29:37+00:00,texases,"It had to happen - saw a Caddy XTS this morning...with a vinyl roof. Whole 9 yards, the strip with the fake snaps for the non-existent cover..."
37,2013-12-28T17:54:42+00:00,tjc78,"I've seen one like that, a CTS done the same way too. It just doesn't work on new cars. My 04 Grand Marquis has a full cloth roof, but on a geezer car like that it's acceptable, lol."
38,2013-12-28T21:46:38+00:00,Michaell,"OK folks, I know I must have been hallucinating when I saw this on I-25 the other day.
A three door Audi A3. Had dealer plates on it. I know they weren't sold here in the US; Canadian maybe?"
39,2013-12-28T23:39:02+00:00,fintail,"Not in Canuckistan that I know of. I think it exists in Mexico.
I do know of a first gen A3 3 door that was running around in NW WA back around 2001 or so."
40,2013-12-30T22:17:33+00:00,uplanderguy,"My dealer has a screaming yellow C7. It was built in July and is not for sale according to a salesman; it's there for demonstrations and to take orders. I despise the color, but I like the car. I'm still accustomed to round lights on a Corvette, but I could enjoy one...won't happen for a looonnnnggggg time. Funny, I'm not a fan of the styling of C2 Sting Rays--especially not the split window (let's take something that's hard to see out of and make it even worse!), but I like the '14, overall."
41,2013-12-31T20:07:39+00:00,fintail,"Not new, but hilarious - local Lexus dealer has a Sprinter van for parts duty. A lot of these, of course, have MB emblems and grilles installed. So what does Lexus do? Puts a Lexus badge on it. Does the ""L"" stand for lame?"
42,2013-12-31T23:44:11+00:00,robr2,"Yes the ""L"" seems lame to those of us who know. But the vast unwashed car owning masses have not a clue."
43,2014-01-01T01:41:48+00:00,andys120,"I spotted a new Impala parked, got a good look at it. Though I consider silver an unflattering color, the new Impala wore it well. It's a big car, almost Crown Vic size and good-looking overall but I think some of the side detailing is fussy in the same way as a Sonata. No doubt it will sell well, it's a huge improvement over the previous Impala."
44,2014-01-01T12:00:47+00:00,uplanderguy,"I like the new Impala a lot and it's what I'd be driving if I were buying a car now. I thought right away that the dip in the rear door would be a controversial styling point, but I think they're trying to 'nod' to the '65-68 dip in about the same place."
45,2014-01-01T20:16:39+00:00,fintail,"Good point. I am sure it could fool the typical RX driver
Speaking of Lexus, saw a new sport package model parked on the street near me. The styling is not growing on me."
46,2014-01-09T14:05:59+00:00,lemko,A co-worker just bought a new silver Cadillac ATS this past weekend. It has a black leather interior and the turbo four engine.

48,2014-01-09T16:22:43+00:00,fintail,New Fiat 500 4 door centipede model in the workplace parking garage.
49,2014-01-09T16:24:20+00:00,stickguy,I saw my first one on the road recently. An odd duck. Car and driver just did a review and ripped it good.
0,2014-02-07T23:03:48+00:00,texases,"Odd how hard it seems to decently style a van. That new small Nissan is the New York cab, right? Nothing great to look at."
1,2014-02-07T23:32:18+00:00,stever,"Shifty teased me the other day with a pic of the '01ish VW concept van. It still looks good, in that retro VW sort of way."
2,2014-02-08T00:20:46+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"My favorite van ever. If the Aztek had had a moustache like that, it would have garnered much more respect."
3,2014-02-08T00:32:43+00:00,explorerx4,"If that is a picture of small Nissan van I've seen at the dealer for a while, the rear suspension looks like they used leftovers from Elkhart trailer manufacturer."
4,2014-02-08T02:44:41+00:00,fintail,"On foot for 45 mins, saw 4 Teslas, a Fisker, and a 2014 Range Rover - the latter lacking the turn signal option pack, of course."
5,2014-02-08T03:06:34+00:00,explorerx4,Was a van like that ever in a bank robbery movie? For some reason that what I thought of. Is there a manhole cover underneath it?
6,2014-02-11T22:31:35+00:00,stever,"Nissan NV200 in dark blue. Looked okay. Really narrow in the rear view mirror. About 68"" wide vs 75"" in our '99 Quest."
7,2014-02-11T23:36:57+00:00,robr2,Saw a Ram Promaster van - in appliance white.
8,2014-02-20T02:48:50+00:00,fintail,Saw 2x CLA today...quickly becoming not so new. Also a new 3er wagon.
9,2014-02-24T20:46:11+00:00,fintail,"Saw what might be a mythical beast, what looked like a base CLA - no sunroof."
10,2014-02-24T20:48:24+00:00,robr2,That was the one base unit they imported in order to say that CLA's start at under $30K.
11,2014-02-24T22:07:49+00:00,kyfdx,Went to the local new car show.. The one they had on display stickered at $40K..
12,2014-02-25T04:08:25+00:00,fintail,"There homologation special, in a way. I don't think I've seen another lacking roof.
On the rare base model topic, there's a base 1990 LS in my area too, cloth interior. I can't recall if it had a roof or not, but rare car either way."
13,2014-02-26T01:54:19+00:00,explorerx4,Edmunds has a long term CLA that I'm pretty sure doesn't have a sunroof.
14,2014-02-26T04:34:49+00:00,fintail,"Good catch, I didn't notice that initially. Their car appears to be modest but not base spec, but still rare without a roof.
I notice customer reviews here are positive, too. Maybe it isn't the hateful thing as claimed by CR."
15,2014-02-26T12:13:41+00:00,robr2,"I spotted a CLA45 AMG yesterday. Black with deep tinted windows. $45K seems to be a bit steep for a compact, FWD biased sedan.
After seeing a few, I've reached the conclusion that the styling of the CLA is trying to hard. Compared to the staid styling of the rest of the lineup, the CLA is quite flamboyant. That of course is IMHO."
16,2014-02-26T16:34:43+00:00,fintail,"At 45K, it's a bit of bang for the buck. But most on the lot will be more like 60K, which is harder to accept - with W204 ending production, you can get a C63 for almost the same money, and IMO, it's more car. Upcoming S3 will give it some competition."
17,2014-02-27T00:35:58+00:00,explorerx4,Someone exiting the parking lot at work in a new white MKZ. Also an extremely clean or brand new TSX.
18,2014-02-27T02:58:45+00:00,fintail,"Saw a 2015 Tahoe sitting at the Chevy dealer, finally an update to something that predates the parting of the Red Sea"

20,2014-02-28T20:55:46+00:00,andys120,"I had a glance at the new Cherokee in traffic this AM and also the other day. Perhaps I've seem the same one twice as both were whiteI thought it looked better in reality than photos would suggest.
I also saw a new-style Avalon and it struck me that I've seen very few of those. They should be more popular in a big retirement area like this. Perhaps the styling is too ""out there""
for the intended market although I myself prefer it to the bland style of previous editions."
21,2014-03-01T11:52:46+00:00,tjc78,Toyota was trying to move the Avalon to a younger audience. In that market it has no place as it's not much bigger than a Camry and for those wanting something upmarket they may as well get the ES350. IMO they've ruined the Avalon and it will never sell like the previous generation. I loved my 06.
22,2014-03-02T03:32:45+00:00,fintail,There's a CLA sitting on the prime real estate corner of the used car section of my local Lexus dealer. I wonder what that's all about.
23,2014-03-04T16:31:32+00:00,fintail,"They couldn't guarantee my car would be done today, so I got a loaner:
Not bad - build date 11/13, 200 miles on it - has pano and sport package, no nav, base lighting. They used to get loaners from Enterprise, now do it in-house."
24,2014-03-04T21:54:47+00:00,fintail,"And my car is back already - they just unjammed the telescoping feature. Seems like it was a freak occurrence.
I only got to drive the C for several miles - didn't mind it at all, I examined it pretty closely and assembly quality was exceptional. They had a fleet of C loaners hanging around when I returned, some of them C300 4Matics - maybe using them now rather than waiting for them to be unsold later, when the W205 comes out. They have CLS loaners for S-class customers, too.
On the drive home saw a RR Phantom with huge wheels, probably 24"" or larger. Gaudy."
25,2014-03-05T00:41:22+00:00,boomchek,Saw a new S Class on the road already. Looks like a nice evolution of the previous model. Also saw a new BMW 2 Series. They have much nicer proportions compared to the previous ones.
26,2014-03-05T00:48:21+00:00,stickguy,"Fin, I like the C class much more than the CLA. Much more comfortable inside."
27,2014-03-05T00:56:16+00:00,berri,"Saw a new, white Impala today. That color made me realize that while I think the new Impala is a pretty nice looking car; it, like many of the different recent redesigned cars, all seem to have more than a little of those Sonata like generic styling cues. I'll call it aerodynamic wedge look (including the rear profile) for lack of a better term."
28,2014-03-05T01:51:20+00:00,fintail,"I haven't seen a 2er that I recognized yet, but I have seen a couple 4ers, with the questionably styled ""bimmerang"" fender decoration.
The C has aged really well for something that entered production 7 years ago. There should be some screaming deals on leftover W204 before the upgraded replacement hits the road this fall.
Regarding Impala, it's that 6 window thing, a fad among many mainstream sedans right now."
29,2014-03-05T16:32:16+00:00,andys120,"Sighted yesterday:
-New Mini Cooper S, a little larger (but still smaller than Golf/Focus), less cute, more butch.
-New Jeep Cherokee. I pulled up to get a good look at the side profile of the pointy nose. From that angle it's certainly a bit odd but not screwy-odd like the Juke. I thought it looked good overall in dark grey and distinctive."
30,2014-03-05T17:55:13+00:00,Michaell,"For the Cherokee, there are two different nose profiles - the more ""pointy"" one is the ""Trailhawk"" edition, which is more off-road ready."
31,2014-03-05T18:08:43+00:00,texases,"? They both have the same grill, right? The Trailhawk has a bit more prominent bumper, it seems.
The Cherokee is one of those designs that has grown on me (unlike the Juke). It's OK, now..."
32,2014-03-05T19:26:36+00:00,Michaell,"The idea is that the approach and departure angles on the Trailhawk are higher than those on the other versions.
The Cherokee is one of those designs that has grown on me (unlike the Juke). It's OK, now...
I, too, like the look of the Cherokee. Just not sure of the build quality and the strength of the new 9-speed auto. And, it's pretty pricey - a Limited version with the options the wife and I would want comes to between $35-40K."
33,2014-03-06T02:49:52+00:00,fintail,"Rather than mentioning seeing a Tesla, maybe it is time to count them - saw 5 of them this evening. And in one incident, one beside a Fisker Karma. Maybe it's because the Tesla was stopped and the Fisker was moving, but the Karma made the S look like it had the panache of a 15 year old Camry.
Also saw a 4er, surprisingly dirty."
34,2014-03-06T17:25:30+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Fisker is a beautiful car in person--my friend's dad has one so I get to see it now and again. The Tesla S is large enough to notice but by my tastes seems to strive to be unoffensive in every possible way. I'd rather look at a Chrysler 300C.
35,2014-03-06T19:23:19+00:00,fintail,"It's inoffensive and modern, which is probably the point. Woo in tech and gadget people."

Do you use a Club or any other similarly manual anti-theft device? That might cause some problem with the auto tilt-telescope wheel."

39,2014-03-07T19:52:17+00:00,fintail,"Nope, never used one - the cars I drive seem to be seldom stolen. It was just a fluke fault, and is now working fine.
That new Phantom in your pic is very much like the ostentatious thing I saw. I wonder how the owner got the money...
Speaking of Phantom's, these are the best:
The somewhat smaller and understated Phantom V from the early 60s has to be one of the classiest and most elegant cars ever built.

Well, the new Phantom is not as stately as the old one in any case. But part of the problem in this comparison is the wheels fit on the new Phantom. Putting those on a Rolls Phantom should be a felony. It would be a closer comparison if you compared the new Phantom with the psychedelically painted one that the Beatles had."

One kid at Miami U. and another one in college in a year, though. There's no working at the bookstore to cover over $100K in tuition, like in the old days though. The Impala's big, and I could see my wife having nicks all over it though. I wasn't aware the new Tahoe was out yet. My dealer has an SS but I haven't seen or heard an ad at all about it. I admit that I don't watch much TV though."
46,2014-03-15T02:38:46+00:00,fintail,"What I saw was actually a Yukon (it was dark, but I think I remember GMC) - but the local dealer has at least one 2015 Tahoe visible from the street. Saw a Volvo V60 on the road near the dealer too, not bad looking at all.
The new Impala is a big car - good for hauling people, but maybe a bit big for a commuter. I had that rental last November and was pleased with it, but might not be what I want for parking around here every day. I haven't seen an SS, just the police model."

At least it wasn't an X6. Speaking of BMWs, I saw a new style X5 not long ago. I think I saw an ActiveHybrid 7 last week, they have the distinctive badge around the c-pillar.
So you're saying you don't want an M235d xDrive GranCoupe? BMW is out-nicheing MB, and looking kind of silly."

12,2014-03-21T12:22:06+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Haven't seen any V60's on the roads but a few dealers have a couple of them on their lots. What a sharp, sharp looking car. Shame that you can't get the wonderful Twin Scroll Turbo-6 anymore unless you pony up for the R-design which I imagine will be a limited run. Volvo seems to be really pushing their new TC/SC 4 cylinder which has amazing performance on paper but I imagine will be kinda stale in the engagement, similar to the BMW 320i. And there is still no availability of AWD on that model yet...
Other sightings for me have been a couple of Accord hybrids, tons of Mercedes CLA's, quite a few new Nissan Rogues (significant and very well done upgrade IMO) and quite a few of the new Highlander which I hardly see much advertising for so the thing is definitely selling itself.

Built in Kansas City too. Will anyone jump ship because of the historic $1.2 billion settlement against Toyota for hiding stuff? Both are terrible for sure; I can partly probably attribute GM's to the revolving door of CEO's the past several years. I don't know what I can blame Toyota's on."

I'm a mechanical dummy, but I like things to look original/authentic, so emblem placement and things like that, if not right, make me crazy. This car was good on that kind of stuff.

Uplander, don't worry about posting your Stude - it's a cool car and we know you miss it. I really like the sunroof on those.
I like the 61 Chevy too - like a 60 Ford, an odd evolution between 50s gingerbread and 60s modern. I remember telling my mom a nice driver 61 Impala convertible would be worth 25K - she was shocked. It was an $800 used car in the late 60s. My parents both had much more interesting cars before I was born than after, which is maybe typical (still hard to imagine my mom driving a Beetle with a Porsche 912 engine).
Speaking of new cars, stopped by the MB dealer to discuss a quirk on my car. Not much there, but they had a lot of E-class, and most weren't too loaded up. Must be the lease special ideal. There was a moderately optioned CLA in the showroom, I didn't bother to see sticker. A cool white E63S was in the parking lot."

Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, Audi, Bentley, Land Rover and a bunch of others are all crammed into four or five square miles alongside the Loop 101.
I specifically wanted to see the new Jaguar F-Type. I wonder if they are selling at all because they've been out for almost year and I had yet to see one. There weren't any on view outside of the store so I sauntered in and asked. He pointed me at a white roadster and (apropos of previous comments about white cars) barely registered vis a vis the XK it was sitting next to.
Then I noticed the black roadster sitting nearby and strolled over for a look at this Triple Black example. Oh my! this car had all of the visual excitement and drama promised by the photographs and TV ads I've been seeing all winter. I don't know if black's the color I'd get but I've long felt that there are few cars flattered by the appliance white that's so popular now and the F-type is the perfect example.
Sitting in the car you're conscious of the fact that the car is sizeable, at least as big as a 'Vette and nearly as big as the XK/XKR. Visibility is fairly poor out with the top in place and you sit very low in the car.
Also seen, plenty of Ferrari 458s in coupe and Spider form, a couple of new F12 Berlinettas in the obligatory red, a nice BMW Z4 in Metallic Pearl White (not Appliance White), some slinky Jag XJs and an example of every Porsche and Audi currently made as well as some nice Maserati Coupes and Q-portes which all seemed to be black.
On the way home I spotted a new Stingray convertible w it's roof up. The tan top appeared to be more thickly padded than on previous Corvettes."

My observations:
-New GM Yukon/Chevy Suburban - too squarish looking for me and they're pushing the CDN $70/$80k range. A tad pricey for something that will be worth about $20k in 4 years.
-Chrysler Sebring - very impressive, and 1000 times nicer than the previous Sebring/200. It should do ok against others in its class.
-Ford Transit minivan - cool van with European feel and flair to it. Totally dig it.
-Hyundai Genesis - very nicely redesigned and loaded to the max with features. I like it too.
-Mitsubishi i Miev- neat electric car but at what price? CDN $30k+. Might as well buy a Mirage for half the price. $15k will buy you a ton of gasoline, about 10+ years worth.
-Mitsubishi Outlander - very bland looking thing in person, not sure it will help the brand.
-speaking of Mirage, base model is $12k, add any half decent options to make it usable and it pushed $18k. A Civic or Mazda 3 would probably be better value.
-New Golf/GTi - very very nicely done. A premium compact car that feels very upscale. Not surprisingly the VW stand attracted the most hipsters. Nearly everyone looking at the Golfs had some kind of a beard, thick framed glasses, and/or toques.
-Lexus - those snouts are not very attractive. Makes the whole line look very goofy. The GX is imo the worst offender.
-Mercedes- loved the E350 wagon. I always loved wagon and this one is no exception. Would take it over an SUV any day.
My favorites were at the BMW stand:
-BMW i3 - such a cool little car with that concept car feel. Love it.
-BMW i8 - same thing, out of this world looking
And my favorite car for sale right now, is still (and has been for the past year or so) the M6 Gran Coupe. What a stunner! I love everything about it, and it would be the perfect ""family"" car for me."

I got there right when they opened, to avoid the crowds, and to have some time to dawdle around the city afterwards. I posted a few pics and observations on the ""auto show"" thread here.
Did you notice their E wagon seemed to be squatting in the back? Something was odd there, it was sitting too low - but I didn't point it out to any of the salespeople/agents there.
I liked the new Transit too, neat little Euro style thing, another rig that makes me think it wouldn't be too hard to turn into a motorcycle hauler - as this one is a little longer than the current model.
The i-series cars are cool. The i3 is funky and futuristic - it might put off some, but I think younger people will love it. i8 is amazing looking, as it should be for the price.
Speaking of new cars - last week a new Civic appeared in my garage, another one is there too - same ""pinwheel"" hubcaps, this one a kind of maroon coupe.

Too bad about the meet up. When I got there, no line at the self-serve kiosks (which I used), only a couple minute line to get in. I left just before noon, I did notice a line then, and a lot more people inside. Where did you park?

Yes I noticed that too about the Benz Wagon. I think the wagons have air suspension, but not sure why it would squat in the back.
Yes my number ends in 0, I had the same number for a good 10+ years now.
I got to the show at around noon and had to wait a good hour for tickets. I was a bit choked that for a big show like this there were only 2 ticket booths (apart from the self service credit card stands). And when we got in at around 1pm it was quite busy."
33,2014-04-01T23:31:22+00:00,boomchek,"I actually took the skytrain in. Didn't want to pay $25 for parking. Drove to my parents house, took a 20 minute skytrain ride (which cost me $10.50 total both ways for me and my dad, and my son was free). Skytrain went right to downtown about 2 blocks away."
34,2014-04-02T02:57:08+00:00,fintail,"Not bad. I parked for $3/hr, which seemed fair enough. If we meet up next year, train might be a good option.
Saw an A3 sedan on the road, not sure if it was being tested as was under a mile from the dealer."

And it seemed bigger than in pix, could be a great city car. But, like most electric/hybrids (and, BMWs!), expensive."

He got lucky and got one, with no waiting so he was able to actually drive it for about 4-5 months and get all of his money back when he sold it privately."

Also a dealer in NH has their first 2 series. a basic 228i with a sticker of about 36 grand. I like the size a lot, it's about the same as an E36.
They also have a slick X5d on display in front. 65 grand..."
43,2014-04-07T16:56:28+00:00,laurasdada,"Passed a Bentley convertible (in front of the Ferrari/Maserati dealer!). No Gray Poupon was exchanged.
Not a Continental GT, although it looked new, must have been a slightly older Bentley. Still, impressive."
44,2014-04-07T17:40:49+00:00,fintail,"Probably an Azure. They cost an insane amount of money when new, much more than a new Continental even in the dollars of 15 years ago.
My local RR-Bentley dealer has several Ghosts and Mulsannes sitting outside the same way a normal lot would stock Civics or Corollas."
45,2014-04-07T18:11:26+00:00,laurasdada,"Yes, I believe that you're correct. An Azure. Much more formal and imposing than the Continental. No local RR/Bentley dealer on my route.

I am sure 30 or more years ago, this area was really different. A lot of people hit the jackpot buying houses here when they cost no more than anywhere else (and now pretend to be the second coming of Warren Buffett)."

BMW-Subaru is an odd combination, kind of attracts a different demographic...but maybe not for all models. But odd dealer combos could exist - in around 1990, I lived in a town where Chevy and Toyota shared a (not too large) building! And Honda-Buick had the same building too.
I remember the Loyale, it was kind of a retro car by the 90s, when a Legacy made it look really old. Definitely still sold in the PNW anyway."
9,2014-04-08T15:41:27+00:00,fintail,"Van is even crazier than Seattle - I think average prices are literally double. Different factors at play, but the same result that people who were at the right place at the right time got lucky. Some of them pretend they knew what they were doing.
I still see Loyale wagons now and then, but the sedans seem rarer. There was a Loyale style coupe in the late 80s (I forget the name, GL something probably), I saw one a week or two ago."

He borrowed $1000 and moved to Hartford to start his own copy machine distributor which he sold for $80 million. Then he started with one dealership in CT and the 52 stores he now has sells 40,000 cars and generates $2 billion in revenue.
I bought 2 Hondas from his store.

Always felt really well-treated at HC Lexus. Bought the BMW at HC BMW on Comm Ave, a slightly different experience being in the city, but again, treated well. And, HC Jag/LR in Sudbury, nice little autoquartermile there. Under construction, but understated and nice folks. Even though they forced me to trade in my XK for an XF....yeah, it's their fault.
Maybe when it's time to trade up to a Maserati (reality has just left the building), I'll play EBJ, Jr. against Herb."
15,2014-04-09T13:23:59+00:00,anythngbutgm,"In my experience, your better off sticking with Chambers. I'm not a fan of EBJ, he doesn't seem to have the integrity and honesty that his dad had. For instance a friend of mine bought a RAV4 from him back in like 2006. About a year after she got it, I pointed out some damage under the door where it looked like it had fallen off the truck. As far as I know she still has it and it's got something like 200k on it but every time I see her she always mentions the crumpled door sill which she probably would have never noticed had I not pointed it out.
This is just one of the stories that comes to mind at the moment. One other thing is the excessive upselling they do come maintainence time. I took my S2000 to one of his dealers a few years ago just to have a yearly inspection and the whole time the service guy kept coming to tell me about all the things that needed to be replaced, including stupid stuff such as a tire inflation valve stem cover. Then they had the audacity to tell me I needed a new air filter. ""Um, I have a K&N in there, and it's about a year old so..."" I told him. Guess what went missing all of a sudden when it was time to pay the bill. Yup. They threw it away and replaced it with a stock one already...
I didn't have to pay for it but I was also out a 60 dollar air filter...
I've bought many cars thru Chambers and have had very good luck with their service as well. And as much as it pains me to say this, I hate buying Subarus knowing that EBJ gets a cut on every single sale in this Country based on the deal his grandpop set up back in the 70's (I believe) making Boch thee largest distributors of Subies not just here in the states, but in the world..."
16,2014-04-09T16:42:21+00:00,robr2,"I've used Chambers for service on my Honda vehicles and they seem to upsell as well.
As for Ernie Boch Jr. and Subaru - his company only gets a cut of Subarus sold in New England. His father set up the original distributorship here and it stands to this day. Subaru of New England is one of four distributors left in the US - two Subaru and two Toyota.
Surprisingly, Boch only has 8 dealerships - two Honda, two Toyota, two Scion, one Ferrari and one Maserati. He turned over management of them to a team and focuses solely on Subaru and making stupid cartoon commercials. Ernie Jr is now about 55 and married a very young woman a few years back.

I think I'm going to rename in the Mercedes pkwy since every other car I saw was a Merc. from the most common C/E Class to the ultra rare SLR, SLS, or AMG model... Wow.
Yes, I'm exaggerating a little, every other car was certainly not a Mercedes but they certainly dominated this trek from what I noticed. But being such a ritzy area, there were plenty of other sightings from Audi, Bentley, Tesla, BMW, and Porsche. New RR Sports were very common, I saw quite a few of those, as were Porsche Cayenne's.
We ended up pretty much following a gorgeous new M5 the whole way down but we also managed to pick up a Maserati Ghibli and a Porsche GT2 along the way. On the other side of the highway I spotted a couple of Maserati's, a few Astons, a boatload of Model S's, an Audi R8, a CLA AMG, a new Viper, a couple of GT-R's, a couple of Continental GT's, Jag F-Types, etc...
Oh, and another common one was Jag XF-R's, saw a few of those things as well. Jag still seems to remain a common choice amongst the money crowd...
Highly, highly recommend anyone coming from the Northeast to take the parkway route, you will not be disappointed. It's smooth, scenic and you can actually cruise at 80-90mph with no worries. And if you have the time like we did, take a break off one of the offramps and check out some of the towns along the way. We had to make a pit stop on New Cannaan and my wife didn't want to leave it was so nice...
And the Car show was incredible. Highly recommend it as well.

For the full Gordon Gekko experience, take one of the Greenwich exits and head to downtown Greenwich.

Drove a Mazda 5 diesel with a 6spd manual over there on Saturday. Gearbox felt like rowing through a box of gravel."
47,2014-05-06T03:20:42+00:00,stickguy,"The soul is neat. But the CX-5 is quite a bit roomier, and from everything I have read (and my test drive!) will be a much nicer long distance travel car. Can get a stick also if you want.
consumers reports tested a Soul this month. got a score of 74 (XB was XB, CX 5 also 74, and Forester an 86).
for the Soul, lows were stiff ride, scant cargo room behind rear seat. Highs were small, easy access (being a box helps), simple controls (Good for you old folks!), brakes and features. Of course, the sticker on theirs was 24K+, so it was loaded up.
I think a CX-5 sport is a nice compromise to live with no matter what you need to do with it."

But do see a lot of them on the roads around here along with the Tuscon and Sportage as well as the Rav4. From what I can see, the cuv's are basically taller compact vehicles...my Tuscon is about the same size as my last generation Civic with a higher seating position. Makes for a good compromise actually for guys like me who are getting a bit older and also have spinal issues. I no longer fall into my vehicle but slide over into it which is so much easier. I predict this segment will become more popular in the next few years as more boomers start to feel the effects of aging.

7,2014-05-07T02:13:34+00:00,tlong,That's the reason we really like our Mazda 5. It's taller than a sedan but shorter than a CR-V or equivalent. You pretty much just slide right on in. And it handles way better than one of the cute 'utes.
8,2014-05-07T02:30:42+00:00,stever,"@slorenzen, funny, had a good breakfast at a joint in Sun Prairie WI this morning between test drives, and I heard the main guy chatting with someone about a $12k '67 Buick Riviera for sale there. So I chatted him up and what the guy really loves are 65 Chevy SS's with the three taillights. But he wants a non-restored one since he can't swing $30 to $40k (this guy was really a 20-something kid). And now he's worried that unmodified ""daily drivers"" with the nice patina are jumping up in price fast. But he loves those Sixties cars - he had a bunch of pics of the Riviera on his smartphone.
Back to your question, his daily driver is a Sienna he got used with 160k that now has 200k and runs like the proverbial top. Looks good too and less road rash than my Quest.
But - we really want to downsize a bit from a minivan. And new ones are pretty pricey tricked out like we'd want. $30k is about our limit.
@sandman_6472, haven't looked into the Tuscon. Seems like it may be a tad smallish. 70 cubit feet is our target and the Tuscon comes in around 54 cubes. But those boxes can work pretty good when you get a good sized hatch opening to go it."
9,2014-05-07T06:30:03+00:00,tifighter,"@stever The new Rogue is getting good press (youtube Alex on Autos for an in-depth review). and hits the 70 Cu ft cargo number. If you are looking at the CX-5, it may not hurt to throw the Nissan in the mix."
10,2014-05-07T12:01:44+00:00,uplanderguy,I saw a chocolate brown Venza yesterday and it was striking. And I'm a guy who is usually turned off by Asian styling.

15,2014-05-12T20:32:30+00:00,explorerx4,A silver CLA in the parking lot at work.
16,2014-05-13T14:31:55+00:00,anythngbutgm,I've seen a couple of A3's recently. Audi drivers in general tend to be the most aggressive around here...
17,2014-05-13T16:22:15+00:00,laurasdada,"Another Acura NSX, this time in silver.
Had a nice Jag moment the other night: As I was departing work in my XF with the green light, at the red light onto the road I was entering, heading west was an XJ and heading east was an XK. Long live Britania!"
18,2014-05-13T18:12:06+00:00,fintail,"Saw 2x new X5 and a new small Transit, this one a passenger model."
19,2014-05-13T21:13:11+00:00,stever,"Edmunds just published a 2014 Ford Transit Connect First Drive review. They liked it better than we did from driving one a month or so ago. I'd comment on the article but after 9 or 10 test drives recently, stuff has run together and I can't really put my finger on all that just didn't feel right (non-reclining second row seat, a bit stark interior, three acres of dashboard)."
20,2014-05-13T21:21:35+00:00,fintail,"No doubt the Transit will be a little stark and weird, it is a converted commercial vehicle after all, not really a minivan.
Saw a Ghibli, which somehow made me think ""Audi""."
21,2014-05-14T10:01:20+00:00,qbrozen,"Adjustable 3rd row but fixed 2nd is odd, as is a bench in a minivan, forcing you to fold it to access the back, like a crossover. Couple that with the fact that you can't get factory RES and that the truecar pricing puts a loaded Caravan (with dual-screen RES) at almost the exact same street price, there is no way it makes sense to me."
22,2014-05-15T01:37:19+00:00,fintail,"Saw a 2015 Escalade sitting at the dealer today, and nearby sat about a dozen 14s - so if you want a 2014 car that is almost identical to the 2007 model, step right up - deals to be had."
23,2014-05-16T02:57:39+00:00,fintail,Saw a new Corvette on the road today.
24,2014-05-17T01:04:54+00:00,lemko,Spotted a red Cadillac ELR last night near the American Legion hall in my neighborhood and a black Tesla that pulled up next to a neighbor's house down the street.
25,2014-05-17T15:35:45+00:00,robr2,Last night I spotted a C7 Corvette Convertible - black/black/black
26,2014-05-18T02:18:57+00:00,fintail,"I just saw a black new Corvette, but every panel cut was outlined in red. Kind of a Tron look, not what I'd call pretty, really."
27,2014-05-18T23:13:33+00:00,andys120,"I saw a new Sting Ray convertible today, the first I've seen top down, very attractive in Electric Blue. I'm still made at GM cuz my Dad's Northstar blew up (@67K!) or I might entertain buying the new 'Vette."

29,2014-05-23T12:49:40+00:00,lemko,Spotted a maroon Ford C-Max followed by a black Ford Fiesta on Oxford Avenue near St. Vincent in NE Philly.
30,2014-05-27T22:09:54+00:00,fintail,"Saw yet another new X5, another A3 sedan loaner car, and loaded white S63 at the dealer."
31,2014-05-29T20:51:46+00:00,andys120,"I got a look at a new BMW 428i the other day, the second such I have seen, it was white. Like the black one I saw a few weeks ago it was in Sport or MSport trim because it lacked the chrome window surround of the Luxury line cars.
The Four is a nice looking car that is a dearture from it's 3 Series forebears in that it has a sloping rear in place of the notchback/trunk that has been on 2 door Bimmers since the 1960s.
The sloping rear and low roofline gives a very sleek look but the 4er is aso noticeably larger than it's predecessors
I'm confused by BMW's current policy of offering every model in three stages of trim, the cheapest of which is called the ""Luxury Line"" (?) The Lux line is distinguished by the chome surrounding the side windows which the more expensive ""Sport"" and ""MSport"" Lines lack.
This seems bass-akwards to us old timers who can still remember when the down-market lines didn't get the chrome trim and the Impalas and Galaxies were dressed up with chrome.
They say ""less is more"" and that's certainly true of chrome trim but ""none is nothing"" to coin a phrase."
32,2014-06-02T13:36:42+00:00,lemko,"Spotted a dark gray Audi S8 on Pine Road just outside of Fox Chase in NE Philly. It had a plate that read ""1 of 860."" Can anybody tell me what this might have been that distinguishes it from other S8s or is the S8 itself that rare?"
33,2014-06-02T15:28:30+00:00,qbrozen,"saw an i3 in Jackson, NJ this morn. I was quite surprised to see one in the wild already. Had on permanent plates already, too."
34,2014-06-02T15:29:19+00:00,fintail,"Was it a new one? I don't think they are that rare, might be some kind of edition. Some older ones might be less common. AMGs scoff at 860 units being rare - E55/E63 wagons were 100 or less units per year in the US."

36,2014-06-02T21:41:09+00:00,qbrozen,Maybe its 1 of 860 in dark grey?

With only 860 RS 6 sedans destined for delivery to the U.S. starting next year, Audi believes there are plenty of people who will happily pay that much for massive overkill and grand one-upmanship."
38,2014-06-02T23:00:09+00:00,kyfdx,Nice... my google must be broken.. I couldn't find it. Good job!
39,2014-06-03T01:33:36+00:00,fintail,"That Audi shows a design issue - the same sausage, different lengths.
I'm waiting to see BMW i series cars here - the way that affluent tech dorks have snapped up Teslas around here tells me some BMWs will sell, too."
40,2014-06-03T13:34:15+00:00,lemko,"Actually, I think that was the car. I was trying to follow it in my wife's Buick LaCrosse trying to read the nameplate, but that apparently was an exercise in futility. He was moving at a pretty good clip."
41,2014-06-03T13:35:22+00:00,lemko,One of those tech dorks in a Tesla ran a stop sign a couple days ago and almost hit me!

44,2014-06-09T17:44:18+00:00,lemko,Spotted a dark red Hyundai Sonata Hybrid at Bleigh and Oxford Avenue in NE Philly.
45,2014-06-09T18:11:23+00:00,fintail,"Saw my first Macan in the wild, a Q5 hybrid, and 3x new style Range Rovers in about 30 mins - la belle epoque."
46,2014-06-09T19:12:36+00:00,kyfdx,"Outside the fancy Concours car show, saw a couple of Macans. (I like), and the new Volvo V60 wagon (I like a lot)."
47,2014-06-09T23:05:33+00:00,fintail,"Was driving by the Porsche dealer, noticed a Macan sitting outside - I had time to spare, so I stopped to look. Turbo model, 78K MSRP. I had to laugh, it had the smoker's package - definitely aimed at a demographic around here."

also some incredibly nice looking 911s fresh off the truck. I had a sad."

1,2014-06-10T03:58:48+00:00,stickguy,"also saw, out driving around, a 328i GT. A little goofy, but I kind of like it, but I always have been a hatchback fan (loved my 1991 626 5 door)."
2,2014-06-10T04:03:43+00:00,kyfdx,@stickguy One for you!
3,2014-06-10T04:09:29+00:00,stickguy,I love the V50. But not the faux sports model with the huge wheels. But a sharp car with a fantastic interior.
4,2014-06-10T10:30:24+00:00,stever,"@kyfdx, I still haven't heard if that's what Edmunds added to the fleet. A teaser pic of a taillight was posted by one of our editors on Twitter last week."
5,2014-06-10T11:36:01+00:00,kyfdx,That picture is of the new V60
6,2014-06-10T14:12:15+00:00,stickguy,I know. Just a typo.
7,2014-06-10T17:26:16+00:00,kyfdx,I figured as much... that was just for the lurkers...
8,2014-06-10T18:29:41+00:00,anythngbutgm,Love... So wish you could get the wonderful Straight 6 Turbo in this trim instead of having to spring for the R-design tho.
9,2014-06-10T21:25:09+00:00,explorerx4,"V60 looks good, but not a fan of the c-pillar area."
10,2014-06-11T14:02:54+00:00,qbrozen,"I love it. But, man, that's expensive! Came up with like $46k for a T5 optioned up and over $50k for an R-design equipped the same."
11,2014-06-12T02:38:23+00:00,fintail,"Saw 2x new X5 today, a new Range Rover with a tacky aftermarket grille (why do money and taste diverge past a certain point?) and a new S-class - at an intersection near a W116 450 SEL. The older car is one I see around now and then - some patina, Centra wheels, and a mild exhaust defect that makes it sound mean. It probably scared the new car."
12,2014-06-13T14:13:12+00:00,texases,Passed one of these (same color scheme) on the way to work. Makes a Ferrari look boring!

17,2014-06-14T01:50:37+00:00,texases,"Yep, an Aventador. When I see a Ferrari, I think 'nice'. When I saw that, it just was 'Wow!' Not saying it's a great design, but it is attention getting."
18,2014-06-14T03:31:15+00:00,fintail,"If I was shopping in that segment, I might entertain a McLaren - seems marginally less douchey. Only Ferrari I'd want is the FF, no Lambos really do anything for me. Or maybe something like a Pagani, Italian exotica but Mercedes heart."
19,2014-06-14T03:39:22+00:00,stickguy,"not that it will ever matter to me, but I always saw the Lambo as appealing to a different demographic (well, different sort of rich guy) than a Ferrari, and especially the more esoteric brands."
20,2014-06-14T14:07:28+00:00,andys120,"Personally I don't understand the appeal of Lamborghinis. Sure they're outstanding performers and some are really great looking but for what they cost they ought to have it all. What's missing is heritage; Lambos (and Paganis) have never been proven on the race tracks of the world. If I were to spend that kind of money I'd want a Ferrari, Porsche, Maserati or another brand with a racing heritage."
21,2014-06-14T14:08:23+00:00,explorerx4,A new yellow C7 Corvette with matching calipers. Not my color.
22,2014-06-16T17:40:51+00:00,stever,"Whoa, a BMW i3 about 20 miles south of Santa Fe. Tried to get my wife to catch up with it but we were already doing 75 on a 75 and the i3 was in a line of cars bombing along in the left lane doing 80 something.
With an 80 to 100 mile range, if this guy was heading to Albuquerque, he must have had the range extender version."
23,2014-06-16T19:03:09+00:00,tifighter,"I've been seeing quite a few of the much-maligned new Mitsubishi Mirages. Green ones, blue ones, purple ones. I don't know how they are selling nationally, but they seem to be doing okay locally."

25,2014-06-23T00:02:30+00:00,fintail,Saw an i3 on the road today - dorky but neat.
26,2014-06-23T12:10:07+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I actually saw (2) of those i3's over the weekend. No dorkier than a Prius but definitely unique. Both brown...
Also quite a few new Volvo V60's, mostly T5 base models but I did see a really sharp Burgandy colored one like the picture that was posted here a couple of weeks ago.
Lots of new X5's as well. And a dealer near me has a couple of the new Chrysler 200's so I stopped by to check them out. Classy..."
27,2014-06-23T14:26:25+00:00,stickguy,Will see a new Sonota this week. They sent a coupon for a free soccer ball with a test drive. Good enough excuse for me and my daughter. She has the gene!
28,2014-06-23T14:54:59+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Cool, I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts. I've seen the new commercial with the guy and his daughter in the parking lot and it's quite the handsome car IMO. The quad exhaust might be overdoing the ""sporting intentions"" a bit but the car itself is pretty nice in the shots."
29,2014-06-23T15:13:55+00:00,Sandman6472,"Got the same Hyundai email and debating whether to go check it out even though I'm not in the market. The wife is and I'm thinking the Accent is not going to be what she's going to want especially if she keeps it as long as she has the Mazda. So thinking the Elantra might just be the better vehicle. We talked about another Mazda3 and she said if she goes that route, she'd want an S model again though it is a bit pricey now, we paid $17k for our '05 model. So, who knows what's going to happen. They took the Mazda up to Atlanta for a small road trip and no problems so far...the a/c only works on 3 & 4 but all else is fine. Personally, I think she should purchase around Labor Day but again, her decision and think she's shooting for the last week of the year.

34,2014-06-23T18:53:17+00:00,qbrozen,"Personally, I like it. I don't think its flashy, as it actually hides the exhaust more. It becomes part of the diffuser, is symmetrical, and doesn't hang below the bodywork."
35,2014-06-23T18:53:47+00:00,qbrozen,"Spotted a white Macan in my town this morning.
Barely stands out other than the side indents. I was thinking I'd like to see one with RS markings."

Not a bad looking car from the rear, but as we say at cocktail parties: ""A bit busy, don't you think?""
But given the demographic for the car, you'd be crazy not to overstyle it."
37,2014-06-24T17:40:56+00:00,qbrozen,"The little fins are to smooth out turbulence as the air leaves the car, which improves aerodynamics and, hence, mileage as far as I have heard/read."

The new Sonata isn't ugly per se - definitely nicer than the current model. The rear end gingerbread is just a little pretentious. However, the market seems to like it, it will sell."
39,2014-06-24T19:16:21+00:00,imidazol97,"If the fins are the ""fins"" between the 4 exhaust tips facing downwrd, I really have trouble believing there's any effect on air flow."

People were buying the units as a place to park their money, but never living in them. so you basically had a ghost city (no companies in the offices, no residents so no stores, etc.) Yet, the places were largely sold out.

Not so bad here, where property ownership is simply a pathway to residency - when the axe eventually falls in some locations, those with the means will want out, fast.

Makes for some interesting cars anyway. Newly arrived 20 year old with no job in a 100K++ car is not an unusual thing on the west coast."

Today in downtown traffic I passed what appeared to be a VW Jetta Sportwagon but in place of the ""Jetta"" lettering in the rear it said ""Golf"" and it wore the ""TDI"" designator on the right as well. I've read that Volkswagen is planning to introduce an AWD version of the sport wagon to be badged as a Golf (as they are everywhere but North America). I looked on the VOA website and could find no evidence of such a vehicle in the current lineup

If it was the current Sportwagon, it's possible some ""enthusiast"" changed out the nameplate so he could be ""oh so Euro."""

But, seriously, how many people are driving a Volt through Death Valley? Just seems silly to me."
10,2014-08-06T11:26:53+00:00,robr2,"Got it on the Escape.
How often is anyone driving anything through Death Valley? Tongue in cheek as well. Death Valley is used because it's a naturally hot area - it's cheaper than building a climate controlled test track."

Also saw a new Sonata, rental with QR stickers, likely National or Alamo, I think.
New C-class is on the MBUSA site, and I know of someone in Houston who has posted pics of one at his local dealer. I might go annoy the local dealership about the car tomorrow."

Wonder how it will do."

I dunno if that means they are selling like crazy or are not selling at all. They had a surprising number of B-series cars, especially since I almost never see them on the roads.
I noticed yesterday that according to the M-B website the 2015 C-class has a dash similar to the CLA with the glued-on iPad-like screen jutting up from the center of the dash. A step backwards IMO."
25,2014-08-25T22:08:10+00:00,kyfdx,"Recently saw a listing of the top-ten fastest selling models, measured by days on the lot, and the CLA was one of them. Maybe, they are delivering them, as fast as they get them in?"

3 are mountain grey with Ash MB-tex interior (what color is ash? Black?)
1 is white with black red-cut interior. It's available for $64K if anyone wants the
info to contact the dealer to buy it...
Of course Mercedes could be just not delivering as many as the demand might be

Early on anyway, sales were literally 100% more than predicted - it's a huge home run for MB, and I bet the margins are nice, too (built on existing platform, built in Hungary).

M4 - MSRP 83 or 86K, good luck (it'll sell). Lexus showroom was pretty bare, but an almost zero option IS250 seemed unusual. Used A7 was the most interesting thing on the Toyota lot - man the 4Runner has a homely face. Chatted up a friendly salesman at the less than crowded Caddy dealer, who had 5x ELR on the lot - first thing he said was ""problem with those is that they are too expensive"", good. New CTS is a really nice looking ride."
34,2014-09-01T22:44:32+00:00,ab348,"It is, in the right colors. Local dealer has one in black and one in a dark grayish shade, both with black insides, and they look kind of blah. But I do like the design. The problem I have is that they are priced in M-B territory now. I am a GM fan but I know their trim, hardware, switchgear, mechanicals, etc, is not of the same quality. And going to the dealer for service and waiting in line behind some pizza delivery kid in a Sonic is not what I want at that price point. I was thinking I would probably buy a CTS to replace my Regal, but they may be pushing me to M-B. I like the E-class and the new C-class is interesting."

36,2014-09-01T23:14:51+00:00,fintail,"CTS has grown up, it seems E size now. ATS is more Regal comparable, IMO. I think it looks good in white (along with the E). The darker metallics are very sparkly, which is a cool kind of retro thing. Nicely equipped, around 60K - which isn't far off the E, maybe 10% at most. The MB might lease better, especially for a returning customer. My local Caddy dealer is Caddy only, so the dealer experience shouldn't be the same. But, I don't love the center stack design. I'll probably be brand loyal when my current term is up, but I don't mind looking. I still think about buying a car, but as long as I can afford it, might as well live a little - and there aren't many modern used cars that I really like, nor do I know if I want to put an older car into daily driver use.
The C shows the future of MB, where the E will probably be pushed up a notch, and the C slotting in below the current E, but not entry level. With the new C being able to be optioned north of 60K (in the US), things are changing. CLA is the new C, C will be a smaller E, E a smaller S."

Here, Caddy is standalone, near the Chevy dealer. The dealership once had a cool 70s style building in a great location, but it was apparently leased (?), and moved about 4-5 years ago. The current location is odd - it's the old Hummer dealer, faux Quonset hut style. Small showroom, but decent outdoor lot. The local big Germans and Lexus have palaces in comparison."

The head gasket issue was cured a few years back when they updated the engine design."
45,2014-09-02T14:48:00+00:00,texases,"Thanks, good to hear the CVT wasn't a droner, unlike some. I like the room (especially headroom) and visibility in our Forester, both of which look to be retained in the new one."

He was a bit meh about the car and figures everyone else must be too, since the word is that they are going to be discontinued in the US after this year along with the Insight. He gets better in-town mpg than the EPA, up to 43, so he likes that part.
One problem is that it's black and he's quickly learned that you shouldn't get a black car in New Mexico. But in his case it wasn't the heat, but keeping it clean. He was cleaning off the car with his California Duster when I ran into him."

6,2014-09-09T19:07:03+00:00,qbrozen,"I wonder if that would be a good car to tow behind a motorhome. Guess it largely depends on how much you have to drive it between stops because running the generator of the motorhome just to charge the Leaf is probably not economical. However, charging it while driving the motorhome might not be so bad (I have no idea if that's even possible)."
7,2014-09-09T19:14:26+00:00,stever,"@qbrozen, I was behind it so didn't notice a tow-bar up front. An irv2.com post says you can't use it as a toad unless it's completely on a trailer. Too bad, probably would make a good toad otherwise and there's plenty of plug-ins at the RV parks."

30,2014-09-16T19:41:45+00:00,stickguy,"I think it is partly to be a luxury brand. People expect premium.

I know my RDX has the same basic engine as iirc the accord. Almost identical specs, including the compression ratio. I have used all grades and nit found any noticeable difference.

I suspect whatever they tweaked to take advantage of PUG was added at the top margin, nit dialing back the basic engine output. Whatever it is I don't notice the difference."
31,2014-09-16T21:17:55+00:00,ab348,Maybe it carbons up without the additives in Premium. I think there has to be more than expectations.
32,2014-09-17T01:58:41+00:00,stever,"A minimum amount of additives are required and I bet Chevron dumps the same amount of Techron in the tanks whether they are filling them with regular or unleaded. Ditto Shell and the rest. Not sure I buy the ""if a little (the minimum) is good, a lot is better"" argument.

Then we get into that whole Top Tier argument and whether it's worth it or just marketing. Sure looks good on paper though.

Spotted a new Caddy SRX - not sure how new. Mostly caught my eye because it was black and looked hot. As in hot, not HOT."
33,2014-09-17T02:11:26+00:00,stickguy,"well, I go between Regular, mid grade and Premium (depending on prices and my mood) but I always stick with name brands. Sunoco, Exxon/Mobil, or Shell unless there is no other choices."
34,2014-09-17T02:13:33+00:00,stever,"Heh, I filled up for $2.99 for regular today. Don't even remember the brand now, much less if it was Top Tier."
35,2014-09-17T02:13:48+00:00,ab348,"Well, up here the major fuel companies all claim, both in advertising and on the pumps, that their Premium fuel contains the most cleaning agents. Don't think they would lie about that. But believe what you want."
36,2014-09-17T02:15:39+00:00,stever,"Oh, I believe that I guess, just not convinced that it makes much difference. I used to use Chevron a lot in my Boise years but now I just dump a bottle of Techron in the tank once a year or so."
37,2014-09-17T02:16:02+00:00,stickguy,"well, if that is true, everyone should put in premium, even if the car only calls for regular, right? because if RUG runners are staying clean, can't be all that important!"
38,2014-09-17T02:18:10+00:00,ab348,Direct injection engines seem to have issues with carbon buildup on the valves. I have also read where fuel tank sending units can be sensitive to the use of some low-grade RUG. I would only run Premium if I was anticipating keeping the car for a long time.
39,2014-09-17T02:28:46+00:00,stickguy,"DI might be an issue. But, if they don't require it, should not be an issue. and a bunch of DI engines call for RUG. So not sure if PUG will actually make a difference. Can also put in techron or something approved by the maker."

But it could probably run on kerosene for awhile, before coughing up the FI unit like Doc Brown's DeLorean in 1885.

Two different not connected independent MB mechanics recommended Chevron to me. I figured that can't be a coincidence."
43,2014-09-17T03:27:47+00:00,stickguy,Don't think I have seen a Chevron station in years. Not sure if they even have them in Jersey any more.

That list? So, my Stang only recommends premium? I'm still not going to run regular ... ever."
47,2014-09-17T13:00:00+00:00,Michaell,Both the wife's Mazda and the daughter's MINI require premium - the Mazda only gets Shell V-Power (there may have been < 5 tanks in 3.5 years of another brand of 91 octane) while the daughter puts in whatever is convenient for her at the time.

2,2014-09-19T01:30:10+00:00,fintail,And today saw the exact same S3 again.
3,2014-09-19T13:11:28+00:00,ab348,It's no longer new then.
4,2014-09-22T13:46:19+00:00,texases,Saw my first BMW i8 on the road.
5,2014-09-22T14:28:09+00:00,robr2,I've come across at least 3 i3's here in the Boston area.
6,2014-09-22T17:08:00+00:00,kyfdx,Wow.. still haven't seen one.
7,2014-09-22T17:14:58+00:00,laurasdada,"Other than at the Petersen in LA, I haven't seen an i8 in the wilds yet. i3, yes. Toy-wise, I want an i8."

9,2014-09-24T02:07:29+00:00,stever,That was fast. Saw another Leaf today - this one with a bumper sticker about a big energy spill and everyone smiling (i.e. the sun is shining).
10,2014-09-25T02:08:43+00:00,fintail,"Saw a kind of gaudy Bentley Mulsanne today - subtle it isn't. Also a new style Porsche Targa, the mechanicals of which should age well in about 20 years."

12,2014-09-28T00:11:50+00:00,fintail,Spotted a GLA at the MB dealer - might go look tomorrow. Also saw a C400 at the holding lot behind the car wash.
13,2014-09-28T20:38:14+00:00,fintail,"I checked out the GLA - I don't hate it as much as I thought. It was locked up, but it wasn't offensive. The AMG model might be pretty cool, kind of a WRX for grown ups.

Also sat in a new C300 - moderately equipped at 50K. It had Burmester, HUD, Pano, and expected gadgets. It has really nice seats, I liked it. The slight bump up in size makes the car feel better inside, too."
14,2014-09-28T21:27:05+00:00,stever,"Not sure of the year but I spotted ""my"" Soul today. White, panoramic roof, local dealer purchase. Looked great and even the bigger wheels didn't bother me. Looked to have plenty of ground clearance.

18,2014-10-12T23:30:55+00:00,fintail,"Not new, but saw an SLS Roadster in Kelowna yesterday, kind of an odd place for it.

And as usual, Canada loves small new cheap cars - I think this is where most Yaris and Mirage volume will go. Still waiting to see a Micra on the road."
19,2014-10-13T16:57:01+00:00,qbrozen,"saw a new 200. Quite a good-looking car. It seems really small, though, compared to other mid-sizers these days. If Edmunds didn't say otherwise, I could have sworn it was an equal to the Dart rather than a size up."
20,2014-10-14T23:29:14+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new Mustang on the back of a car hauler today. Also not new, but a MB B-class doing duty hauling construction supplies, seemed funny."

25,2014-10-18T16:56:59+00:00,fintail,"Went to the MB dealer to air up a tire, saw a white GLA awaiting delivery.

Also saw a new small Transit on the road, and while leaving Vancouver, an M235, being driven exactly in a manner that one would expect."
26,2014-10-18T17:32:49+00:00,ab348,"The GLA fascinates me for some reason. I must try to drive one. Odd, in that I do not like the CLA at all and CUVs/SUVs are not my thing. But something about that GLA talks to me.

I was at the local Ford dealer last weekend and they have a lot full of Transits. They look different than what they used to sell so I guess they are the bigger ones, the Econoline replacement. Will take some getting used to."

Just saw my first Chrysler 200. I agree. Wonder if the Dart's days are numbered?"
28,2014-10-18T17:55:00+00:00,stickguy,"Similar design language, but I found it to be quite a bit bigger. More like Cruze to Malibu, though the Dart IIRC is a little bigger than other compacts.

much nicer interior quality too."
29,2014-10-18T17:59:47+00:00,ab348,"To me, the 200 looks too narrow for a mid-size car. It really does not make much of an impression on me one way or the other. Chrysler is not on the list of brands I would even consider these days."
30,2014-10-18T18:06:12+00:00,stickguy,"At the end of the year when I go to get a new car, I will probably take a look at a 200 (who am I kidding, I will look at everything!). Though largely because I will likely be leasing, so bang for the (not many) buck will be a key factor. So if they are offering some kind of blowout lease on a well equipped model, I can give it a shot."
31,2014-10-18T20:51:16+00:00,berri,"the 200 looks too narrow for a mid-size car

Sometimes I'm faked out on that by overall styling. Never really checked the specs. If I was looking for a sedan I'd probably be looking a bit larger. The Chrysler I'd be more interested in is the 300, but I'm still a bit leery of the company."
32,2014-10-19T14:05:19+00:00,qbrozen,"I think Chrysler is doing a pretty good job these days. Time will tell us if the new products are more reliable than the old, though. Bought a lifetime warranty on the wife's van, so I'm pretty well covered.

On the Ford Transit, I actually saw a truckload of them on the road a couple of days ago. All the new small wagon version.

@ab348 - I feel the same way you do. Really dig the GLA (also the GLK), even though I'm not much of a ute guy (although other smaller ones in the past have appealed to me, such as the EX35 and now the Macan), and I'm definitely not a fan of the CLA."
33,2014-10-19T14:43:27+00:00,stever,"Some of the editors here don't much like the CLA. Lost the link, but I think one of the Detroit papers was quoting Dr Z at the Paris auto show to the effect that they could sell twice as many if they had the capacity."

The Transit is the big one:



The Connect is the little one:"
35,2014-10-19T17:10:12+00:00,fintail,"Went to the Seattle auto show yesterday. As expected, MB - BMW - Audi stands were packed. New S-class coupe had a crowd around it, people were swarming over the GLA too. Several Audis were also being swarmed, along with the X5. New Camry DLO fail is as loud in person as in pics. New Mustang looks pretty cool, Corvette also had a crowd around it. Caddys looked nice, ATS coupe is has some style. Lexus RC-F actually looks better in person than in pics. There was a decked out Chrysler 200 with a two tone steering wheel reminiscent of a Bentley. Tesla was also being swarmed, which surprised me - they aren't exactly rare here - maybe people from outside the city. And lots of others I am forgetting.

A friend of mine has a thing for the Lincoln MKZ, and was drooling over the one on display. The pano roof pushes his buttons. I could see him picking one up if a deal is to be had."
36,2014-10-19T17:11:22+00:00,fintail,"During the initial months it was offered, sales doubled the forecast, and they couldn't be kept in stock. I think the honeymoon period is over now, and they aren't hard to find.

The car is built to a price, but it does offer some style and badge snobbery for the money."
37,2014-10-19T17:20:36+00:00,fintail,"I don't mind it either. The AMG model seems pretty cool. But I was told my a salesman that initial lease offers won't be a bargain, so I doubt I'd pursue one."
38,2014-10-19T17:54:10+00:00,stickguy,I still think the GLA looks like a Mazda 3 with a Benz grill stuck on it.
39,2014-10-19T19:20:19+00:00,ab348,"It doesn't have that Jimmy Durante schnoz that the 3 has. The 3 gets raves from reviewers but I find it misshapen and out of proportion.

I was just back from looking at a GLA on the dealer lot. They only have one, all black of course. The black does it no favors. The interior looks not too bad from what I could see, but the tint on the rear window prevented me from seeing how much room is back there. Did I read that these are assembled in Hungary or some eastern Euro country?"
40,2014-10-19T20:34:25+00:00,stickguy,"nose is a little different, but the profile is what really looks the same."
41,2014-10-19T21:57:43+00:00,fintail,"CLA is made in Hungary - I think the GLA is made at the Rastatt (Germany) factory.

I went car looking today. Local dealer has a new S550 coupe, beautiful thing. 150K MSRP. They also had a GLA45 AMG with every little accessory and add-on I could imagine - 71K! Seemed a little much. Cool car though, I sat in it, I like the seats.

Also looked at BMW - no diesel wagons on the lot. A couple diesel 3er and 5er. I sat in a 5er - I suspect a leftover 14 might lease well. Looked at Audi too - tons of A3 on the lot now, many lower line FWD models with mid 30s MSRP - definitely fighting the CLA. Several diesel A3 there too, and a couple diesel A6. An apparent demo RS7 with 125K or something in the window was nice, too."
42,2014-10-22T01:12:44+00:00,fintail,"Saw 3x 4ers on the road today - 2 coupes, and a GranCoupe. I still say the normal coupe is proportioned weirdly, too long in the middle. Also 2x new Sonata, both rentals - they make the previous gen look really dated, just as we predicted for the overstyling."
43,2014-10-23T00:53:13+00:00,fintail,"Saw my first TLX in the wild. It's not bad looking, somehow seems smaller in person when on the road. I don't care for the upkick at the C-pillar, with is de rigeur for the sycophant designer crowd these days (even GLA has it). It's that kind of thrill."
44,2014-10-23T16:44:02+00:00,laurasdada,"I believe I saw an A3 convertible today, just down the road from local Audi dealer. Shorter/stockier than an A4, grey with black cloth top. Looked good, at first glance..."
45,2014-10-24T01:09:28+00:00,fintail,"My local Audi dealer had a few A3 convertibles on the lot when I was car looking on Sunday.

Saw whatever the latest Aston Martin is, this afternoon, parked in front of the local art museum, beside a DB5. Hmm which would I want."

I'm happy about the changes to the interior and particularly the suspension, but looks to me are just alright. I'm just not keen on the back side windows and profile, but if you like the '14, I think you'll like this one too."
48,2014-11-01T00:34:58+00:00,stickguy,"saw one on the front line of the dealer close to my house a couple of days ago. Did not stop in to look at it.

I agree that is looks quite a bit like the old one, so not sure why people are so upset about it. Definitely evolutionary exterior. Interior pictures, and reports look much improved."
49,2014-11-01T02:21:42+00:00,berri,"Personally, I think when the convertible version comes out, it will look better."
0,2015-01-07T17:53:32+00:00,Sandman6472,"Lexus NX, not quite sure what it is...is it similar to the 200CTh or is it taking it's place? Looks a bit edgy for a Lexus but after awhile, think it would grow on ya. Just a bit awkward looking up front. Also saw a few new Camry's and meh, it's like it's an overcooked Corolla if you will, just nothing exciting about it really. Very bland looking with no pizazz to it to be honest. If it drives like the 2014 model, it'll ba nice driver but the looks, very homely and plain boring. It's like they only went 3/4 of the way with the styling and they really need to go that extra 25% to get it right. Just nothing memorable about the looks, which is a shame because underneath, I'm sure it's a great vehicle.
This is a great time to buy or lease a vehicle, there is so much great stuff in the market place with new changes happening constantly. But as I found out this last year, one should buy or lease what makes them happy, don't settle for a vehicle because like me, you will not love it and you won't be happy. In my case, I finally found something I really wanted to own for a long time and though I lost a bit in depreciation by trading so soon, it was the right thing to do for me and luckily, I was able to do it. I made a slight detour but finally got to where I needed to be!

BMW has approached the range issue through weight saving and aero design. It's at least a 1/4 ton lighter than a LEAF and consequently considerably faster. I think this car is a world-beater but I'll tamp that down until I get to drive one."
4,2015-01-12T20:57:06+00:00,fintail,I noticed the i3 appears to have motorcycle tires - they are really narrow. Looks worst from the rear. The badge and i8 halo effect will help it as much as any actual capability.

I went with a light blue Golf this time just to break the cycle for me also, light blue over beige. Have always had a black or gray interior so just hope I get used to the lighter color...so far, I've kept it pretty clean but I am alone in it like 90% of the time. That'll change eventually but for now, trying to keep it very clean.

Popped into a Honda dealer too. Saw the current Pilot with a tag hanging off the mirror: Lease for $180 weekly, $0 down. Cars have become so pricey that ""weekly payment"" ads are starting to become common. That's a whopping $780/month for a Honda suv lease."

24,2015-02-01T00:45:17+00:00,berri,I saw a bunch of them several months ago while I was in the Milwaukee and Chicago areas. I'm guessing they are in the rental fleets. Also saw quite a few of the new versions Chrysler 200's and suspect the same.

I saw 4 Lincoln MKZ's today. I was very surprised.

@ab348 Were you visiting a Lincoln dealer?

Next question is whether there's a Ford plant somewhere in the area or Ford supplier
and a lot of people have a discount to buy Ford.

In an upscale suburb at west edge of Wayne County Michigan (Detroit), I noticed a lot of
Lincolns. It has to be the fact that many worked at Ford or their relatives did and they
have a discount, so although there were many varieties of Ford in the driveways, there
were lots of Lincolns especially compared to my area here in western Ohio."
27,2015-02-01T17:51:33+00:00,fintail,"I see non-rental MKZs now and then too, and I am in an import-centric area. It's a fairly striking car. A friend of mine has a thing for them and he might end up in one - he's under 40, too."

As fin noted, it's a striking car so perhaps people are finally buying them. Boston is an import centric area as well so any of the US brands are typically outnumbered."

I agree. I think what is holding it back is that most consumers just assume it's a Fusion in a Lincoln wrapper. That's Ford's fault over the years. I've not driven one, so I don't really know."

I sat in the MKC at the auto show in November, I liked the styling overall but one thing that irked me was some of the switch gear (wiper stalk, headlight knob, etc.) was exactly the same as the Fusion/Escape, etc. I realize there's a lot of parts sharing across companies but it can't cost that much more to upgrade a few small switches."
33,2015-02-03T17:00:09+00:00,Michaell,"Actually, it does, especially if you're only going to make a fraction of the number of these ""new, special"" switches. Every part in a car has a piece cost; overshoot the budget on just a few of them and your end sticker price goes up as a result.

I suggest you read the book ""Car"" by Mary Walton. An inside look at the development of the 1996 Taurus and Sable. Interesting read, especially the parts where they try to differentiate the two models."

I understand that costs add up, I should have added that I never thought the switch gear in the Fusion/Escape was the greatest so it seemed even more underwhelming in the Lincoln. So it's probably more fair to say they all seemed cheap, and that stands out even more in the higher priced Lincoln. As a comparison, I didn't notice it but I'd bet the same switches in the Accord/TLX, Jetta/A4, etc. etc.were the same, but I didn't notice because they both seemed higher quality."

I went to a local air strip where the entire AMG lineup was there to drive through the cones. They had a GLA which I didn't try, but my friend did, and said it felt cheap and not something he'd consider buying (he has a 2014 X5, and had a 2014 GL diesel before that).

I did try the new S Class, S Class AMG coupe, SLS, E63 wagon, and the new SL. The S Class coupe and the E63 were by far my favorites as they handled well for such heavy cars. But I think Mercedes will do well with their smaller cheaper entries as people love the MB badge and the low entry price."
41,2015-02-10T20:58:14+00:00,ab348,"Last week at the Home Depot parking lot I parked opposite a M-B C63 AMG, probably a 2012 or '13 model. I can only imagine what a rocket ship that thing would be. A few years ago I drove what I think was an '06 or '07 model at a used car lot here and it was great fun. This latest encounter was a couple of days after one of our snowstorms and though roads were plowed, there was still a lot of snow and ice around. Must have been a handful."

I always wanted a W215 (99-06) but after driving many of them (CL500, CL600, and CL55) at my previous dealership as we were one of a few dealers that stocked them, they seem fragile to me and outdated on the inside (especially the ancient Nav unit).

Designo paint and interior, every gadget and nicknack - 73K, probably the most loaded 6cyl around.

They get a great deal on a lease through the company and run it as an independent business like a cab operation. But they are responsible for all maintenance and costs of operation.

Many of the traditional livery companies in Boston have gone to Escalades as their clients are used to large SUV's. If the business is organized as above the drivers who lease have to get what the company tells them to."

Anyways, in typical Murano fashion, it was polarizing and unique. Not surprising, this guy likes polarizing. Before this, he had a GMC Terrain (one of the ugliest vehicles out there IMO) that lunched it's motor at 90k due to a slipped timing chain, and before that an Isuzu Vehicross (Anybody remember those?)...

Interior certainly upgraded from the last one and it's certainly more cohesive than the last one IMO... Actually, the exterior looked very close to the concept that was shown in Chicago last year as well. It's certainly more cohesive than the last one IMO... How come Nissan can translate the details from concept to production so well when so many others water them down (I'm looking at you Subaru)?

Hope to take it for a spin at lunch today."

38,2015-03-13T05:12:32+00:00,tlong,"Went and visited a few dealers last weekend.

Mazda - sat in a CX-5, a Mazda 3, and a Mazda 6. Interiors are not that bad, but why is it always black these days? Hate black interiors. Good values - all 3 of these vehicles top out between 29K and 31K, which is kind of interesting. The CX-5 is probably the most vehicle for that money, but not the one I would buy.

Acura - Sat in their cars in the showroom. As usual, good mix of pricing and some luxury although not a true luxury brand. What you get with them is a partially-Germanic vehicle with outstanding reliablity and reasonably low cost of repairs. Great cars if you buy and keep for a long time.
ILX - I like the size (I prefer smaller cars), but the interior didn't wow me although the leather was really soft. The dash is too squarish for my tastes - looks too much like the current hideous Jetta interior to me.
TLX - Looks pretty nice, surprisingly not that different than my current '05 TL. I wouldn't pay that amount for a car that doesn't seem all that different than the one I have now - which still looks and runs great.
RDX - Nice midsized SUV, reasonable luxury and price. Seems a little less impressive to me than when I sat in one a few years ago. Did I mention that the interior was black? Perhaps that was it.
MDX - Wow the pricing has gone up on this vehicle. No way would I pay >$55K for one of these - but I don't like bigger SUVs. I'd own a minivan before this.

Audi - Hadn't been into an Audi dealer in years. I owned a new '98 A4 which I sold when I got the Acura. Acura is reliable but the Audi was special in other ways.
A8 - Truly luxurious barge at a breathtaking price.
Q5 - I really like the size of this vehicle if I were getting an SUV. I also really liked the brown/tan color combo in the interior. Still, for $42K for a near-stripper model, it didn't seem nice enough to me for that price. I didn't think the interior was $12K nicer than the Mazda CX-5 - but at least it was in a color other than black!
A4 - still a very nice car, nice interior. Price is like $10-$15K higher than I paid in '98, and I had a 6 cyl and these are 4 cyls. The seats are either a super sporty seat or a couch seat (the standard seat) which is too flat for me. Too bad there is not a standard seat with sort of in-between bolstering like my '98 was.
A3 - Smaller, nice looking car. Interior was tight - perhaps even a bit tight for me and I like small cars. Interior was sort of nice but you could tell it was cheaper. I was a bit underwhelmed.

Overall observations - The luxury makes have prices that are more stratospheric than ever before - I suppose it's because everybody leases and few buy. The Audi salesman said ~80% of their cars are leased. Transmissions - I lament the disappearance of the manual. Even in the cars that still offer manual, none were to be found. The Mazda dealer said they were very rare. I miss the manual but I am grudgingly coming to the conclusion that I have already owned my last manual car. My son had said he wanted to learn manual but it's probably a skill like recording a cassette tape that is gone - unless in Europe perhaps.

With a good looking and running classic ('05) TL, I think I'm going to bide my time a bit longer. Nothing I liked was at a good price and I really can't justify those kind of expenses, even though I could afford it. I suppose I could buy a couple years used."

And yet, In Luxury-Car Race, Profits Get Dented (WSJ)

Sounds like the German luxo brands are trying to outspend each other on marketing."
40,2015-03-14T00:58:58+00:00,fintail,"Interesting observations, especially on price. It's really true, especially in terms of lower level models, which have exploded in price. Luxobarges haven't inflated nearly as much, relatively. I use the example of an S-class - in 1992, the average spec one would be 85-90K. Say 105-110K for a typical 2015, so about a 20-25% increase. Average spec C or 3er (or equivalent like the A4 you mention) is at least 50% more now, and it takes no work to load up a C or 3er to 60K - insane. Kind of the same, or different, than some socio-economic trends, depending on the viewpoint. The middle cars have inflated just a little more than the top, but a bit less than the lower lines.

Your TL, relative to the brand, really is a classic - maybe the high point of Acura design. The brand is trying to do better now, but isn't all there yet."
41,2015-03-14T04:36:21+00:00,tlong,"Yes, at 150K on my '05 TL I would normally be about ready to buy another something. I can't say that anything excites me very much at a price that I find tolerable. I look at my current TL and I agree that it is almost a classic in appearance for Acura - they sold tons of them, they have good resale values and mine has been exceptionally reliable. It's interior is still nicer than many of the newer cars (and is not black...).

I obviously like smaller premium sedans and I don't see much out there at a decent price. Here is kind of how I see the market in my general ballpark:

BMW 3 series - hugely overpriced (I realize this is not true for some people) relative to what you get, numb steering, not much luxury. German repair costs.
MB C class - same as 3 series but more luxury, less sporty. German repair costs.
Audi A4 - Way pricy. Ugly couch seat unless you go sport seat. Not great value since you'd have to spring for like $5-10K extra to get things you already get on a loaded Mazda.
Audi A3 - a bit small. Looks a little bit cheap inside.
VW Jetta - bland outside, totally bland inside. I realize that I had a rental that was lower grade and probably the higher trims are better. Also, VW dealers and repair costs.
Mazda 3 - Haven't actually driven it but this is close. But so many black interiors. I've read they're a bit noisy so I'd like a bit more refinement, but at least great driving dynamics.
Mazda 6 - similar to the 3 - but a bit large.
Acura TLX - too close in size and style to my current TL; I might as well keep driving it.
Acura ILX - good size, ok looks, ok interior but kind of squarish. A lot of Civic DNA which isn't that good.
Toyota - No
Lexus - No. I guess I should take a look at the IS - the newest model to me actually is the first where I find the looks tolerable.
Honda - They've lost their way - not as sporty as they used to be. Lots of hard plastic.

I'm also not in the mood for German reliablity issues and repair prices although I tend to love the dynamics of those cars. I buy my cars and keep them a long time - if I were leasing for 3 years it wouldn't matter so much. But with BMW softening up their 3-series and the manual trannys being pretty much gone for everybody, there is not a lot to entice me.

For value that is why I was looking at Mazda, and at Acura, as I can get reliability and reasonable repair costs while maintaining some of the dynamics that I like. But when I look at say, a loaded Mazda 6 or Mazda 3 - I'm not sure they look that much better than my existing TL. Even at ten years old."
42,2015-03-14T18:27:54+00:00,fintail,"Assuming the TL is maintained, I am sure you can get it up to 200K before it suffers a real malady. You got your money's worth either way, so from here on, it is free motoring. After 10 years, I'd be too attached to let go, maybe bored, but I end up kind of bonding, and am trying not to do that with a modern car - one ""forever car"" is enough""

Black interior is a German thing, IMO. Practical, easy to keep clean, looks ""classy"" to boring people. It's also kind of dreary.

The decent priced premium cars are late model used/lease return with a big warranty. New is for lease, used is for purchase. Many leased cars rack up few miles, and can be a good deal after 27-36 months or whatever the standard term. You might even get some new car smell. I might buy and hold if we could get a C diesel wagon, otherwise, if cash flow looks workable, I will probably lease again, unless I find something really cool for sale. My issue is that most used cars I like are getting too old to be 100% reliable low maintenance daily drivers. Most 2000+ stuff bores me, no matter the brand.

Audi has become trendy, no longer sold as a value compared to BMW or MB. Lexus isn't far behind, a well optioned IS isn't cheap.

I am not sure which mainstream brand car I'd pick. I like a slightly larger car, to me the E is ""just right"". I'd probably lean towards Accord, maybe Fusion. But at the price of a loaded one, I might just risk it on a 6 year old AMG with an aftermarket warranty, and help an oil company meet profit targets.
Yes, at 150K on my '05 TL I would normally be about ready to buy another something. I can't say that anything excites me very much at a price that I find tolerable.

43,2015-03-14T19:28:03+00:00,tlong,"Good thoughts. I've thought about a slightly used C-class as I do like the size and look of recent models. Just not sure I want the stigma, or the cost of maintenance. I suppose I should give one a drive.

For the TL, I am somewhat attached as it is really reliable and familiar. It has nav, bluetooth (things that were cutting edge in '05) and premium sound, a nice interior. My driver's seat is beginning to crack in the center bottom cushion a bit due to 150K miles of my butt on it. But I am a bit bored with the car, too, after so long. But there is certainly no good financial justification to get rid of it.

I sort of like the look of the Kia Soul - if they could make it run like an Audi with an Audi interior it would be a cool car. Too bad that the good looking quirky smaller cars are often junky inside and in refinement. I liked the looks of the PT Cruiser, too, but then inside..."

45,2015-03-16T03:06:37+00:00,stickguy,"a real unicorn today. Current style Acura RLX in the wild, in a parking lot. So they really did sell one!"
46,2015-03-16T13:58:49+00:00,texases,"The RLX pretty much summarizes Acura's problems. It's a non-entity in the marketplace. Their other vehicles are improving, hope the figure how to compete in the RLX's niche."
47,2015-03-16T18:35:15+00:00,boomchek,"I stopped by an Acura dealer few months ago and was surprised that for a flagship, the RLX is priced in the $50k range. Even more surprised is that is starts at $49k here in Canada and $55k in the US. It's usually the other way around, cars tend to be cheaper in the US.

But with the TL/TLX having pretty much same tech, powertrain, and options, it's no wonder the TL cannibalized some of the RL/RLX sales as it's thousands cheaper for similar content."
48,2015-03-16T19:09:00+00:00,fintail,"I've seen the RLX as a 4:3 scale Accord at a 2:1 scale price. Hard to believe it didn't sell.

Before the loonie crashed, some MBs were cheaper, spec for spec, in Canada than in the US. A rare event indeed."

There is one where I work. A security guard told me the ""guy paid like $90k for it."" If true, mistake. Big mistake. Local dealer is advertising $31k off msrp on 5 remaining '14s. Nice looks and interior. But, a toy Volt.

And, TLong, I too had an '05 TL. Abyss Blue with the gray interior. As you note, along with the original Legend Coupe, imo, the only (mainstream) Acura's of style. It really pained me to trade the TL, with only 85k miles on it for the Jag XK. But, the looks, sound and performance of the XK somewhat eased that pain!

My '13 Jag XF has a black interior. But it is well broken up by the aluminum (a-lew-minium), chrome and wood sprinkled throughout the interior. While maybe not as ergonomic as an E, 5 or A6; style!"

2,2015-03-21T18:04:12+00:00,boomchek,"I took my 5 year old son to Wilkinson's Automobilia yesterday, as they're shutting down at the end of the month, and after we took a drive down the street to see a new row of mega dealerships that were recently opened. Huge MB dealer, about 2 city blocks long, a Porsche dealer next to it, and a recently opened Acura dealer next to them. Funny enough Acura had their grand opening, but had not one live soul in it. The Porsche dealer seemed like it was busy with a few customers looking like they were working deals in a few offices, and the MB dealer had a ton of customers in it. I don't know what it is with Acura, it seems like after they come out with new products, they get stale so fast and have no new offerings. There was an RLX hybrid priced at a whopping $75k.

When I walked into Acura, it appeared the sales guys got excited that a potential client was in the showroom. When I told the lady at the front desk I'm only here because my 5 year old wanted to see cars, their enthusiasm wound down right away."
3,2015-03-21T21:24:41+00:00,fintail,"75K loonies is about 60K greenbacks these days, I guess it evens out. Still a lot to spend on a 4:3 scale Accord. The model that irks me most is the ILX - they have finally given it some substance, but it still looks forgettable, I don't like that C-pillar either.

I've seen that monolithic set of showrooms, Terminal Dr? Given some demographic aspects of the lower mainland, it makes sense to put a lot in one easy area.

All of the beauty and grace of an X6, in smaller form"
4,2015-03-21T21:56:36+00:00,boomchek,"Yes it's on Terminal. Just a short 3 minute drive from where the Auto Show used to be at BC Place. If you're going to be in town you should also check out (if you'll be in the area) autoform dealership, just a short drive from terminal ave over an overpass and right on Clark Drive. They have pre owned luxury cars and some cool classics like older Maseratis, a Jag E Type, and a bunch of Astons."
5,2015-03-22T17:00:47+00:00,fintail,"I liked the show more at BC Place - easier access and parking. That dealer sounds like a cool place, never heard of it.

Unfortunately, I doubt I will be able to make it for the show, work has spiraled out of control and I need at least one free day per week. But this'll blow over eventually, and maybe I'll take a long weekend up there, or meet you if you come south - I have those Yesteryears boxed up if you still want them, cheap"
6,2015-03-24T00:16:45+00:00,boomchek,Ok I'll let you know when. I'm actually going down tomorrow as we're bringing a few trucks across to the Manheim auction but it'll be a rushed day so I won't have time tomorrow.
7,2015-03-24T00:19:51+00:00,boomchek,"And yes I like the show at BC place more as well. Last year there was an hour long lineup just for tickets. They had only one booth for cash, one for debit, and a handful self serve credit card stations. I wrote and complained that for a ""international"" world class type show they should have planned this a bit better. I know they encourage online purchasing but for those that are in the area and happen to want to go see the show, which makes online purchasing impossible."
8,2015-03-24T00:42:04+00:00,fintail,"No worries, I can keep them for you. I'll probably make it up there sometime this spring or summer, too.

Last year, I got to the show before it opened, used the credit card machine for no line, even found street parking not far away. But I could always do that at BC Place, too."
9,2015-03-24T00:45:58+00:00,boomchek,"Spotted a new 2015 Yukon Denali. Ok, more than just spotted, drove in it, wife drove it as she was a designated driver for us and our friend (who just bought it a few days ago) when we went to a bday party. He traded his fully loaded 2014 X5 XDrive50i that he bought only about 6 months ago.

Nice SUV, very spacious, lots of tech in it, and comfortable. Has 4 or 6 USB outlets which makes charging electronics a breeze too.

Personally I'd keep the X5 but he has 2 kids and found rear seat room in the X5 was tight for a baby seat and a booster seat. Plus when we go on holidays they like to take their boat and end up leaving the X5 at home and driving his 2014 Ram truck. This way with the Yukon he can take his family and tow easily. He was reluctant to do it because he loved the way the X5 handled and drove but likes the looks of the Yukon and the space and capability of it. Even though operating costs and gas aren't an issue for him, he was complaining that his performance summer tires on the X5 wore quickly in a short 20,000kms (12k miles).

Before the X5 he had a 2014 Mercedes GL diesel for about 8 months, and before that a 2011 or 2012 Durango Citadel with all options so he likes to switch his cars often."
10,2015-03-28T17:24:16+00:00,boomchek,"Auto Show observations. Took my wife and son to the annual Vancouver Auto Show. Lots of new cool and interesting cars:

-new Kia Sorento, Hyundai Santa Fe, Nissan Pathfinder, Mitsubishi Outlander. My wife is tired of our 07 BMW 328i and wants an SUV. She loved the Kia Sorento and the new Hyundai Santa Fe. Fully loaded they're about $45-$8k CDN which in my opinion is steep for a Hyundai or Kia but I'll have to admit they're very stylish and well finished and equipped. Pathfinder seems plain inside in comparison. The fully loaded Outlander even more so. I told her for this kind of money we could get a slightly used X5, but after 4 years in a BMW she really just wants something different.

-Lincoln MKZ. Nice car but the huge glass sunroof panel that slides over the rear window looks a bit odd when opened. I wonder what the aerodynamic drag and wind noise is when it's fully opened as it's not flush with the rest of the car but sits a few inches over the rear window.

-Mercedes G Class. The car feels like a vault. The rear door is alike a door from a bank safe to open and close, probably because of the full size spare on it. One of my favorites.

-Honda HRV. Cool looking tiny cross over. Nissan Juke size, maybe a bit roomier. Should sell well as it's attractive. Same for the Mazda CX3 they had (Japanese RHD model). These will attract customers who want to sit a bit higher like in a crossover but don't necessarily want a crossover size vehicle.

-Nissan Xterra. Same design for about 10 years now but finally they started putting extras in it like heated seats and leather. I had a new 2011 Xterra before as a demo, and even in its fully loaded form it had cloth interior and no heated seats, which was surpring because it's a SUV that you'd want to take skiing and after a whole day in the snow you'd want your behind warmed up on the way home.

-new Honda Pilot. Very attractive looking, and totally moving away from the boxy styling. Large size, looks bigger than the Pathfinder."
11,2015-03-28T17:31:06+00:00,robr2,"On the G Wagon, I would expect the door to be like a bank vault - they cost as much as one and get similar fuel economy.

The XTerra is gone after this year so jump on it now if you want a new one.

I had not heard of the CX3. I presume it's Canada only?"
12,2015-03-28T20:03:32+00:00,boomchek,"I liked the Xterra I had as a demo and it plowed through heavy snow with ease. It's a great off road vehicle but one huge drawback was the fuel economy it got.

The CX3 is same class and size as a Honda HRV that's coming out."
13,2015-03-28T21:39:25+00:00,Michaell,CX-3 will be available in the US. 
14,2015-03-28T22:53:07+00:00,fintail,"Fun stuff, wish I could have been there, maybe next year's show.

I recently took my car in for the recall fix, and sat in a G in the showroom. Surprisingly un-roomy in the driver's seat, compared to the size of the vehicle. W204 HVAC controls are out of place in a 100K++ vehicle. But I am sure a local ""entrepreneur"" (sarcasm) will find it stylish and pay sticker.

I still remember reading about the HRV when it hit Britain ages ago - ""CAR"" or ""Top Gear"" called it the ""Hormone Replacement Vehicle"", which probably suits the demographic."
15,2015-03-28T23:10:23+00:00,boomchek,"Yeah the old HRV was a 2 door SUV and I think later on it came in 4 doors as well. They were sold in Europe and Asia but never in North America,

Yes the driver's compartment in the G Class is tight. Probably because the overall body/frame design is about 100 years old lol, ok 40 years old. Keep in mind the first G's, which the current one is based off had bare interiors, less bulky door panels and dashboards because of fewer safety regulations so they probably felt roomier."
16,2015-03-29T00:04:58+00:00,texases,"Went to the Dallas auto show today - biggest disappointment was the Mazda 6. Even without the sunroof, not enough headroom. The roof lowers right over the front seat area...grrrrr."
17,2015-03-29T22:54:06+00:00,fintail,"Good call boomchek - the door panel area is something that caught my eye, seemed so close to the seat. No doubt that design wasn't intended to be loaded up with all the crap seen on the 2015 model.

Saw the heavily styled new Murano on the road today."
18,2015-03-31T20:05:50+00:00,explorerx4,"In the parking lot at work...
A new black Impala replacing an early/mid 2000's black Impala. An orange Dodge Challenger with gray stripes and sunroof, probably some type of Hemi variation."
19,2015-04-03T01:09:02+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Bentley Mulsanne with what looked like 24"" wheels on it today - money and taste and sense so often diverge after a certain level. I expected it to be driven by someone who looked like they are in the ""entertainment"" industry"", but it wasn't."
20,2015-04-04T20:10:29+00:00,andys120,"Fiat 500s are everywhere in the Phoenix metro these days, mostly the basic model but I do see the occasional Abarth model or convertible. The popularity of the little Italian is a real surprise to me in an area that tends to like big pickups and SUVs.

They're catching the Mini in numbers!"
21,2015-04-04T23:11:24+00:00,fintail,"Saw a GLA45 AMG today at the dealer, had a weird kind of goofy decal stripe package on the side. 63K, I think."
22,2015-04-05T08:01:37+00:00,tlong,"I spent some of last week in the Bay Area and was driving in Silicon Valley on the 101. There is a carpool lane that also accepts certain ""green"" vehicles - which includes electrics. I was astonished at how many Nissan Leafs I saw - I counted around 12 in a one hour time frame. Also saw 3 Teslas in only the first 15 minutes on the road."
23,2015-04-05T16:12:09+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,They're also battling the Mini for the lower rungs of the reliability charts. Can Mini make the leap from 25th place to 27th and knock Fiat upstairs?
24,2015-04-05T17:27:54+00:00,fintail,I don't think a day goes by that I don't see a dozen Teslas here- the salespeople are doing pretty well. The lucky affluent middle aged tech dorks finally found a nicer thing to drive than a loaded Prius.
25,2015-04-07T16:40:58+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Good For Haulin' Croissants and Kale Back to the Ranch?
26,2015-04-08T16:47:55+00:00,boomchek,Lot of Teslas around Vancouver as well. It must be a North West sorta thing.
27,2015-04-17T00:51:59+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new Murano (now with more styling!) today, and an B-Class Electric that sped way up while being passed and then dropped back, because subconscious Seattle passive-aggressiveneess."
28,2015-04-17T00:53:38+00:00,tlong,Got my first look at a new C-class today. Can't say I like those taillights.
29,2015-04-17T11:28:29+00:00,robr2,"I agree. MB styling as of late seems to have become a exercise in adding another line or swoosh. IMHO, they are losing their Germanic sensibility."
30,2015-04-17T16:28:41+00:00,ab348,M-B's current corporate rear-end styling across their sedans seems very bar-of-soapy. I don't like the droopy rear quarters look.
31,2015-04-17T18:08:16+00:00,andys120,Ditto.
32,2015-04-17T20:02:21+00:00,fintail,"It's like they are trying to make the ""arc"" greenhouse now go from front to back. CLA has an especially melty rear.

Even with the nose job, the E is probably the most coherent and sound looking MB - as it predates the new design language."
33,2015-04-20T01:35:43+00:00,fintail,"Out for a drive today, did a little car browsing . Seeing a couple Porsche Macan sitting on the lot, one with MSRP nearly twice the other, was amusing. Nothing too insane at MB, but a loaded nearly 90K CLS was a looker. BMW had a ~$1200 lease offer on a leftover 14 M6 Gran Coupe, still seems a bit dear. Saw a Hybrid Jetta at VW, where I explained what ""airscarf"" is on a used E350 cabrio, then guesstimated original MSRP within a grand or so. Toyota had TONS of Prius."
34,2015-04-20T20:45:47+00:00,qbrozen,"Recent spottings in the wild:

Saw a Ghibli 2 weeks ago with NY plates (forgot to report it).
On Saturday, I spotted a new Renegade.
And, finally, today, a GLA250."
35,2015-04-21T15:17:29+00:00,fintail,"I've seen a couple Lexus NX without the F-Sport trim lately - that thing needs the extra garnish, it kind of looks like an overstyled RAV4 without it."
36,2015-04-21T15:31:58+00:00,stickguy,2 Murano convertibles. In the same day. 1 even with top down. Being driven by a man no less.

39,2015-04-22T05:56:19+00:00,andys120,"Recently I've seen two Hyundai Equus (Equusses?). At first I mistook them for a Genesis until I realized they were larger. The styling is reminiscent of the original Lexus LS-400, with bits and pieces of various Honda, BMW and Mercedes models mixed in. One of them even had a stand-up hood ornament that looked like the Spirit of Ecstasy seen on Roll-radiators.

A little more originality please Hyundai, if you can do it with an Accent, surely you can with your flagship."
40,2015-04-22T11:28:56+00:00,robr2,I think Hyundai realizes that buyers of $60K+ vehicles typically aren't looking for distinctive styling. Understated is what sells in that price point.
41,2015-04-22T14:59:40+00:00,fintail,"Equus is a parallel universe Lexus LS. The hood ornament is especially tacky.

Daring styling might not be a selling point in the luxobarge market, but this thing is barely selling compared to both the price point competition and the size competition. I suspect depreciation for this is catastrophic, and even worse for the Kia K9. Only selling to dealers/families and proud people from the homeland, and maybe a few pseudo-frugal oldsters.

Spotted a RC-F yesterday. It's still better in person than in pics, but not pretty. Definitely going after the 3er/4er coupe and A5 demographic, in a few ways."
42,2015-04-22T15:51:07+00:00,ab348,"The big Koreans seem to be finding a niche in the livery market with the demise of the Lincoln Town Car. Probably a good use for them, if they can last for a few hundred thousand miles."
43,2015-04-22T18:23:16+00:00,boomchek,"That's what they're best suited for, livery market. For businesses looking to shuttle clients around, these have the space and features of $100k plus luxury sedans, at roughly 60% of the cost. Since most people don't care about cars, they probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference if they're in the back of a Hyundai Equus or a Town Car, or something else."
44,2015-04-22T20:09:11+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, I have seen at least 1 Equus with livery plates. Makes sense there."
45,2015-04-22T20:36:52+00:00,robr2,"IIRC, Hyundai's sales goal for the Equus was about 2,500 units per year.

They sold 3475 in 2013 and 3415 in 2014. Through February of 2015 they sold 427 which targets out to 2562 units for the year."
46,2015-04-22T21:42:01+00:00,fintail,"And how many to private buyers not connected to the dealer?

Recent auction sales would be amusing, too."
47,2015-04-22T22:10:05+00:00,boomchek,"Those are strong numbers for that car. And speaking of Kia K9 I saw one on the road a few months ago, and I'm not sure it has the presence of the Equus or other full size vehicles in this class."
48,2015-04-23T03:33:21+00:00,stickguy,"a guy that lives just outside my neighborhood (older gent) has an Equus. Black. I always thought it odd, because he is in quite a modest house, and none of the neighbors have anything close to that fancy!"
49,2015-04-23T11:32:38+00:00,texases,Years ago on my drive home I'd pass a modest house that had a new BMW 850i parked in front. I always wondered about that...
0,2015-04-23T11:39:35+00:00,robr2,"Well who bought them isn't info that easy to find.

As for used, I found one at a local Lexus dealer - 2013 Signature with 18K for $35K."

(I'm here all week. Be sure to tip your waiter!)"
2,2015-04-23T14:44:30+00:00,fintail,"Interesting. I bet they have less than 30K in it.

It's just such a puzzling car to me - odd KDM styling, big price, not sure who they think it competes against. The middle lux crowd buying Es and 5ers etc often doesn't want something so big, those who can afford an S or a 7 don't want the badge and cut corners (as it really isn't an S for E money, no matter the propaganda). I think it competes most against nice 2-3 year old CPO luxobarges, and even then, for me, hard sell. But as a 2 year old used car competing against loaded Camcords, might be a deal.

The K9 is much better looking to me, although as boomchek mentions, it's kind of invisible, an Audi-BMW hybrid look."
3,2015-04-23T15:18:01+00:00,qbrozen,"$30k is probably pretty close. A white one with 37k sold for $28,250, while a couple of black ones with 11k each sold for $32k."
4,2015-04-23T17:33:08+00:00,boomchek,"Most of the 8 series BMWs these days can be bought for well under $10k. They've been hovering at around those prices for a decade or so here, at least the ratty ones that were bought cheap before the new owners realized how much it costs to keep them running."

9,2015-04-27T15:05:17+00:00,qbrozen,"I spent some time in the showroom this weekend with the Renegade. It is quite a bit larger than I expected. Looking at the specs now, I see it is basically the same height and width of the Cherokee is about 16 inches cut out of the overall length.

Problem is, if I compare them on Truecar, there is only about $1k difference in the current street price. That's gotta make for a tough sale on the baby brother, I would think."
10,2015-04-27T15:37:16+00:00,robr2,"Give it time. The Renegade has been on the market for only 6 weeks or so. There aren't any incentives on the Renegade whereas there is $2,000 available on the Cherokee."

and on the road, a new design Edge. Did not realize these were out yet. I liked it. Shortly after that, a new Murano. Not attractive. Nissan designers must do a lot of LSD or something."
25,2015-05-09T23:41:41+00:00,ab348,I sometimes think Nissan design exists only in the bizarro world.

28,2015-05-10T05:10:14+00:00,tlong,"Nissan does seem to be all over the place, and often not in a good way.
They changed their US nameplate from Datsun to Nissan. They had some horribly ugly cars in the '70's. The B210 and the F10 come to mind.

Unlike most other Japanese nameplates, they seem to have reliability all over the map - some very reliable cars and some not so much.

And more recently their styling is again all over the map. I thought the original G35 looked good, It has gone downhill with each revision. The first Altmas were ugly, I thought a generation or so ago looked decent, and the newest IMHO are ugly again.

The original Murano looked ok.
Then there's the Juke..... at least it is distinctive...."

Oh, and I saw an i3 on Thursday as well. Strange little fellow."
30,2015-05-10T22:59:58+00:00,fintail,"I think Nissan is still amorphous in a way, a mixx between blobby and edgy. Bucktooth corporate grille, too-thick chrome trim, weird jagged headlights, faux floating C-pillar (new trend that already can't die soon enough), too many reverse slant C-pillars too - add that to the usually loathsome commercials, and I can't embrace the brand, even with its somewhat link to MB. As ""CAR"" magazine would say, ""distinctive, but so is wearing a fez"". I guess they are competing with Toyolex's homely new design language.

Regarding TL to Corolla, I still don't get it. I need to talk to him, maybe the TL was crashed or stolen or something, and he just kind of gave up.

As far as new rides, I stopped by the local Volvo dealer and checked out the new XC90. They had (2), one was a somewhat reasonable 55k while the other one stickered at 76 grand! Still, both were equally impressive, the interiors are absolute knockouts, the exterior styling is both unique and revolutionary. If I was buying in the X5/GLC/Q7 market, I would definitely give one of these a close look.

Wanted to take it for a spin, but it was a demo and it was early Sunday morning. Buy the time we were done looking it over, there were 2 other cars that pulled up to check it out.

I think it's going to be very popular. If only they offered it with a stick and AWD so I could have something to compare to the Crosstrek."

Not if you're looking for +/- $200/mo, it won't. Most of this new crop of small CUV's are leasing in the mid $300's with this month's lease numbers.

39,2015-06-02T15:43:14+00:00,robr2,Yes a CVT is less expensive than a traditional hydraulic automatic but they also deliver better performance and fuel economy. The sound has always been the issue and automakers are improving that by creating simulated ratios and locking ratios in while accelerating so the engine note changes. All of that comes at a price in terms of performance and economy but consumer acceptance/approval of the CVT has improved - on par with traditional automatics.
40,2015-06-02T15:46:24+00:00,texases,"""but they also deliver better performance and fuel economy.""

That's the claim, I know, but I haven't seen it born out in execution. Compare the CX-5 and the Forester - same sizes, engine capacity, and no advantage to the Forester in performance or mpgs in the tests I've read."
41,2015-06-02T17:00:14+00:00,robr2,"The Forester and Mazda use different engine technologies. My understanding is the boxer engine tends to be less fuel efficient than inline or V designs and Mazda has their Skyactive technology which improves economy.

I'd like to see a comparison of the same car/same engine with the 2 different transmissions."
42,2015-06-02T17:19:04+00:00,texases,"True, different technologies, but to the same end. And no impact of boxer vs. inline or V, as far as economy goes. Put the same cylinder/cam/intake/exhaust system in different configurations, it won't care.

Checking on fueleconomy.gov, the Forester does get a couple of extra mpgs compared to the 2.5l CX-5, but a bit less than the 2.0l base CX-5. Not worth it to me, to live with an irritating drive train."

I've not seen a supercharger station yet. I'm still more of a fan of the Volt model; enough juice to commute, but a dino fuel plant to assuage range anxiety."
14,2015-06-17T17:11:08+00:00,Michaell,"+1 on that sentiment, ld. Depending on my budget for my next lease, I may consider a Volt."
15,2015-06-17T17:41:58+00:00,robr2,"There are superchargers at the Auburn Mall a mile from the Pike, Riverdale Shops in West Springfield a mile from the Pike and 91, and at a Dunkins in Bourne before the bridge a mile from Rt 3 an Rt 6.

In NH, there is one supercharger at the Hooksett plaza (aka State Liquor Store) southbound."

I recently had dinner with a coworker from my company who is living in Michigan. He was also in the Bay Area and he said it was very noticeable as he doesn't see very many foreign-nameplate cars at home, and here the mix is entirely different."

Rob, I'd imagine the Bourne Supercharger would get a workout! At a Dunks, brilliant!"
18,2015-06-19T15:55:10+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,I kinda look at a Tesla as a BMW 7 Series with a 9 gallon gas tank.
19,2015-06-19T21:26:24+00:00,bhill2,But one that you can fill up at home (if you are VERY patient).
20,2015-06-20T12:53:39+00:00,odie6l,"Took a ride out to a local Honda yesterday since that was delivery day for a lot of local dealers to get the new Pilot. On first impressions the outside looks nice but you can tell they dropped the ride height significantly. I will have to do a detailed walk through after I test drive it.

Odie
p.s. - Just for reference, we are replacing our '06 Pilot and have come down to either the 4Runner or Pilot. (see pictures below of both vehicles that I took pictures of yesterday)

2016 Honda Pilot


2015 Toyota 4Runner"
21,2015-06-20T13:41:59+00:00,ab348,Pilot looks like it got leftover Crosstour front ends. 4Runner front end looks like an angry Mitsubishi.
22,2015-06-20T15:22:16+00:00,odie6l,"I said the Pilot looks like it swallowed a Ford Fusion with the Gillette grille.

I actually like the front end look of the 4, it has that ""Not a Fluffy SUV"" look to it. Put a push bar over it and it will look a lot better.

Odie"
23,2015-06-20T17:35:19+00:00,berri,"Looking at the Specs, I'm wondering if the new Pilot interior has a lot of Odyssey in it. Lower riding height and less legroom, as well as minivan seats."
24,2015-06-20T18:38:58+00:00,slorenzen,"Aren't they really for different purposes?

A 4-Runner has Hi/Low 4WD, and is a very capable off-roader, and gets less than stellar mpg.

The Pilot is a road warrior, isn't it? Probably gets better mileage, but I don't think it could keep up with the 4-Runner in the woods."
25,2015-06-20T23:41:08+00:00,kyfdx,"I think both of them are used to ferry the kids to soccer practice, in most instances.."
26,2015-06-21T01:24:43+00:00,stickguy,"the pilot is an odyssey, with AWD and less interior room and normal doors.'

the 4 runner is a truck and suitable for off road use.

would think that the Highlander would be the one to compare to the Pilot."
27,2015-06-21T04:05:33+00:00,odie6l,"MPG's are actually even for both. Towing on both is 5k. The 4 wins out with the ride height / clearance. Price wise they are also equal. The Pilot I pictured above was listed at $39,875 for the EX-L with no extras added on (Towing / trailer hitch), and the 4Runner was listed at $36,250. Both had leather interior, but the 4 already had the trailering package on it along with running boards, and 3rd row option.
The Highlander's 3rd row and clearance knocked it off the list since I need the 3rd row for Girl Scouts (I have two and I'm a certified driver for multiple troops.)
My grill on the otherhand (see picture) is the one major reason I need the clearance at the hitch. My '06 is good but if they dropped it any, I'm in trouble.

28,2015-06-21T17:47:02+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Home...two blocks from home...what's the diff really? If you've been driving all day in the Tesla and you come home to change for an evening out, you'd better have another car on standby.

All this recharging and solar this and wind turbine that sounds peachy until you actually try to live it day to day.

I have two friends who live entirely off the grid in the Sierras and it requires a very high level of technology and a lot of planning. This is not Daniel Boone simplicity. They're going to add a Tesla home battery to their life support systems when (if) it becomes available. It's taken them 12 years to achieve a highly efficient level of sustainability."
29,2015-06-21T23:49:02+00:00,stever,"If the panels here at my friend's off-grid house near Taos aren't showing 25 on the gauge, I use the propane stove to boil coffee water in the morning instead of the electric kettle. The sun needs to be hitting the panels before using the kettle or the batteries take a hit. Still, they have zero utility bills, except for the cell/wifi stuff and the mandatory trash fee (and as you can imagine, after composting and recycling, they have little use for the landfill).

Lots of '12 Leafs are coming off lease and there are some great deals on them out there if you just need a car to run errands in around town."
30,2015-06-22T00:40:37+00:00,robr2,I'm in the Bay Area this weekend. I drove from SFO to Sacramento yesterday to see family. It's Teslaville out here. I even saw a car carrier loaded with Teslas outside of Sac city. 
31,2015-06-22T02:06:42+00:00,berri,"Have you been there long enough yet to stop waking up by 4 in the morning? Going back east to Boston will be even more fun adjusting to time zones. Enjoy California, it's just such a beautiful state with so many different things to see and do. Unfortunately, can't seem to find much in the way of free wine tasting in Napa anymore to toast your trip home.

BTW, next time out on the west coast, you'll have to visit Seattle. It's downtown tunnel project may make Boston's look well done"
32,2015-06-22T04:42:02+00:00,robr2,I arrived yesterday and went to bed at 10 PM PDT after waking up at 4 AM EDT. I woke at 6 this AM and decided that more sleep was needed. I did see another odd thing today - my BIL took me to a motocross track to check it out. He rode for a couple of hours. Interesting how family oriented it is with the whole family riding.

A new Ram quad cab and a BMW 4xx power folding hard top.
Also, new TLX, with some kind of, I hope, after market body kit on it."

45,2015-06-26T16:40:53+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I actually borrowed one of those for a few days when a friend was thinking of investing in a Daewoo dealership way back when. My answer was ""Ah......NO""."

47,2015-06-26T19:55:27+00:00,fezo,I so wish I had taken a picture back when. There was a Daewoo dealership up here and at that point it was dead. What inventory there was sat under a foot of snow. The only light was a neon OPEN sign.
48,2015-06-27T01:19:59+00:00,fintail,"I remember when Daewoo hit the market, the local dealer was also the MB dealer (and Toyota, I think). The MB and Daewoo shared the same building, which made for unique signage."
49,2015-06-27T16:26:53+00:00,andre1969,"These Daewoo stories that paint such a miserable picture make me think of a time when I went with a friend of mine, back in college, to go look at cars. The Hyundai Elantra had just come out, and he wanted to give it a try. I remember it being crude, noisy, slow, sounding strained, and at the end of the drive, there was some kind of burning smell coming from under the hood. Needless to say, he didn't buy it. I think that was 1991. At the time, he was driving an '89 Ford Escort LX hatchback coupe, but he wanted a new car, and his brothers were going to get the Escort. Ultimately, he held off and got a '92 Corolla.

I actually thought the Daewoos were kind of neat looking little cars, in an offbeat sort of way. I think the bigger one, the Leganza, was ultimately redesigned and sold as a Suzuki something-or-other."

1,2015-07-17T04:19:07+00:00,Michaell,The Elite is $45K or thereabouts.
2,2015-07-17T12:53:56+00:00,qbrozen,"Our '03 Pilot EX-L stickered at $31k. It is now $38.5k. Inflation calculator tells me $31k in 2003 is $40k today, so I guess they've held the price down. Still hurts to see these prices, though. Ugh. Pretty soon I'll be sitting in a rocker telling the kids what things cost in my day."
3,2015-07-17T13:32:37+00:00,robr2,"Not only have they held the price down, they have added features such as the back up camera, bigger wheels and tires, maybe more airbags, et al."
4,2015-07-17T13:51:53+00:00,Michaell,"That's probably true for all cars. In a previous wife-time, we bought a new Accord LX in 1993 for a ""one only at this price"" of under $14,000. Today that's about $23K. You can easily get the LX for under $20K and it's a much more loaded car - new tech, new gadgets, new safety features."
5,2015-07-17T13:58:46+00:00,texases,"I think that's right. I was a little shocked by Edmund's latest test review of a Suburban LT 4WD, $63k, about twice what we paid for the '95 we had. But with inflation, it's right on the money, plus a lot of features ours lacked."

10,2015-07-19T23:27:47+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Kia K9 (00) today, don't know if that's one for this thread or the obscure car sightings. I see more Equus than the Kia variant. IMO the Kia is better looking.

Stopped by the MB dealer to ask a question. They had a nicely loaded diamond white 16 E400 on the lot - 73K. I think it is carryover from 15 save for new COMAND buttons - production will probably be finished by end of the year, ramping up for W213. Showroom had an S63 coupe, GLA45 with lots of options but no nav, and the usual cars."
11,2015-07-21T20:06:40+00:00,anythngbutgm,"New Pilot, Black. I assume it was a Touring model. Looked great, very expensive looking, I'd even go so far as to prefer it to the current MDX"
12,2015-07-21T20:19:40+00:00,stever,"Nice - I've noticed a few comments saying for the money, you should just go to an MDX instead of a higher trim level Pilot.

So... maybe not."

14,2015-07-21T22:44:49+00:00,texases,"Any chance they're wanting to see how much over MSRP they can get for a new model? That way they won't upset their regular customers with an ""ADP"" sticker..."
15,2015-07-22T03:08:32+00:00,berri,"I actually ran into a Ford dealer recently that had ADP stickers on every new model on his lot, I guess so he could exaggerate customer savings? I mean, more than a few of these models are pretty common Ford fleet or government vehicle sales, so can the dealer really expect there are those many rubes running around their sales lot willing to pay it?"

22,2015-07-25T19:39:13+00:00,fintail,"BMW has had that market for awhile now. The M4 might own it now that the M3 has been relegated to being a sedan. Jaguar is now something for more mature drivers with at least the pretense of refined taste. Infiniti and to a lesser extent Lexus (F-sport) get a little too, maybe those afraid of the maintenance. They all lease though so it doesn't matter. I suspect a majority of M4 don't have the turn signal option package.

There's been a Lexus L F-Sport on the lot I drive by every day - a bit garish for what is usually such a mellow car."

34,2015-07-26T15:44:23+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Depends on which model you buy--what size battery pack. But if you want the longer range Model S, and some nice options, you could bust $130K easy. But I think you can buy 'em as low as around $80K."

According to the website, it's only a store. The service center is still in Watertown."

Looks like 8 charging stations are going up on the left side of the dealer. It's coming together pretty quickly. The ""Automile"" is at least an ""Auto5k"" now.

Amazing how common it is to see Teslas around here. There's at least one BMW i8 in my area, too. Still prefer that propulsion proposition over all battery, all the time.

Still haven't decided what to do: condo or i8! The fact that I'm cross shopping these two items shows my financial prowess and the reason I should really not be allowed to have any money... Oh, I forgot the third item: 8 years of college tuition. Yeah, there's the winner right there."

Yep, all those 'sterling silver' or 'gold plated' cars that pop up on (non-car) web sites are wrapped in metallic film. Quite a disappointment for those folks that thought somebody went out and constructed a car with silver bodywork!"

Hi, Rob: Still being spit and polished, but the building remains the same form. But, brighter, cleaner and more modern looking inside (so far). Looks like 8 charging stations are going up on the left side of the dealer. It's coming together pretty quickly. The ""Automile"" is at least an ""Auto5k"" now.

Amazing how common it is to see Teslas around here. There's at least one BMW i8 in my area, too. Still prefer that propulsion proposition over all battery, all the time.

Still haven't decided what to do: condo or i8! The fact that I'm cross shopping these two items shows my financial prowess and the reason I should really not be allowed to have any money... Oh, I forgot the third item: 8 years of college tuition. Yeah, there's the winner right there.
Drove by this new Tesla store today. They did spiff it up but it's not what I would expect a Tesla store to look like. Here it is in it's previous incarnation.

It's a beer-centric restaurant... A big rectangular bar in the center (60 ft by 20 ft?) with taps all the way around.. The food seems to be consistent with TGIF, or maybe a step up. Typical prices. We've been there a couple of times and it's good.. but, always crowded, which is why we don't go more.

Obviously, a great craft beer selection on tap."

44,2015-09-12T16:17:02+00:00,stever,Still liking the Soul but the GT was a nice ride too.
45,2015-09-12T21:11:03+00:00,Michaell,But your wife still ranks the Encore #1
46,2015-09-13T01:09:19+00:00,stickguy,Hummer FX.
47,2015-09-14T16:48:36+00:00,anythngbutgm,"New Mitsu Outlander over the weekend. Looks much more substantial than the outgoing one. Almost Pilot-esque.

Speaking of which, new Honda Pilots were in all over the place from here in ME, down to Cape Cod and back up thru Vermont where our roadtrip led us."
48,2015-09-14T17:08:56+00:00,laurasdada,"While grocery shopping, a bright white Mazda 6....with a standup Lincoln hood ornament!"
49,2015-09-14T21:24:34+00:00,explorerx4,In the parking lot at work... New Rav4 and Mazda 3.
0,2015-09-15T01:14:35+00:00,robr2,This past weekend I saw two different B Class Electrics here in the Boston area.
1,2015-09-19T23:31:00+00:00,boomchek,"Last week's Luxury Supercar show in Vancouver. The LaFerrari was a big attraction at the show, and after, when it pulled out onto the street and was waiting for a transport truck back to the dealership. More pictures here of new and older cars: Luxury Supercar Show Vancouver"
2,2015-09-20T01:26:44+00:00,fintail,"I've heard there's one of those in my area, but haven't seen it yet. Man I'd rather have a 250GT Berlinetta Lusso than that.

Better driven than the one belonging to the Quatari garbage in Beverly Hills anyway, I'm sure."
3,2015-09-21T19:25:31+00:00,boomchek,"Yes for sure. I was told that to qualify to purchase one you need to be a serious Ferrari collector, owning several vintage and historic multi million dollar Ferraris."
4,2015-09-21T20:04:29+00:00,ab348,"I am no longer impressed with supercars after seeing the hundreds that Saddam Hussein's son had in his collection - many of which ended up getting destroyed in the mayhem over there. All of which were purchased, of course, with ill-gotten gains. Seeing the Qatari jerks with theirs only adds to my disdain. Until I am convinced otherwise, I will assume that anyone who has one is a Bad Person."
5,2015-09-22T01:02:26+00:00,fintail,"You're not far off. IMO, once a certain price point is reached - maybe middle-upper 100s at the most, the amount of ""good"" people buying them (at least when new) becomes a small minority.

This is the new Belle Epoque."
6,2015-09-22T03:44:06+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new style C63 on the road, should be a fun thing."
7,2015-09-24T01:15:49+00:00,fintail,"Saw an i8 in traffic today, poor job stopping at a crosswalk, but it is a BMW after all. Also an X4 for those with a difference sense of style."
8,2015-09-24T01:31:23+00:00,stever,Transit Connect 7 passenger at lunch out of town today. White. Owners are loving it.
9,2015-09-24T05:16:54+00:00,odie6l,"Going to have a nice grouping of sightings coming up in the next few weeks with the Big Hershey Auto Show getting ready to start. You never know what till show up. Mostly older models, but every now and then a new one sneaks in.

Odie"
10,2015-09-25T01:14:22+00:00,fintail,"Saw 3 6er Gran Coupes - one an M6, 3 new style Bentleys, 1 convertible 2 sedans (maybe the same car), and a new style Range Rover which had a ""driver"" with his phone to his ear - perfect time for progressive traffic fines. That's my hood."
11,2015-09-29T01:05:45+00:00,fintail,"Saw an i8, kind of a dark grey with blue accent. Also a new XC90, which is a nice comfortable looking thing."
12,2015-09-29T01:18:18+00:00,stickguy,"parked at a restaurant, a new Miata (red of course, not even sure if any other colors are out yet). I really like the looks of this style. Can't wait to find out if I fit in it now!"
13,2015-09-29T16:12:19+00:00,laurasdada,"That was just me, doing a few test drives..."
14,2015-09-29T16:46:20+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Spotted a new Audi TT H/T today. Sharp.

Also a new GLE Coupe over the weekend. What a beast."
15,2015-10-02T01:07:14+00:00,fintail,"Saw a GLE this afternoon, first one. It has presence - not pretty, but not as obnoxious as an X6. Will probably attract some of the same beloved demographic."
16,2015-10-02T11:42:09+00:00,robr2,"GLE Coupe or GLE CUV?

If the former, I saw one about 3 months ago at the local MB store. Based on the MFR plates, I'm guessing it was the regional rep. IMHO, it is a very homely vehicle answering a question that BMW answered but nobody asked."
17,2015-10-02T14:42:43+00:00,fintail,"One of these subtle beauties:



Definitely a bit homely, and not a ""coupe"" no matter the soulless marketing spin. Unfortunately, as I see X6s and X4s regularly, someone did ask the question. There's definitely a demographic for them."
18,2015-10-02T17:55:11+00:00,robr2,"Just saw at the local purveyor of MB vehicles, two MB Metrises (Metrrii?). One was a panel sided white work van, the other a blue 7 passenger version.. The latter was adorned with MB Tex. No Monroney stickers.

I was surprised both were wearing Hankook tires."
19,2015-10-02T20:46:03+00:00,explorerx4,"Got a ride in a new XC60.Seats are comfortable, but ride is stiff and it has some creaks at 1800 miles.
Also, annoying start/stop."
20,2015-10-02T20:49:49+00:00,stever,Volvo doesn't seem to have start/stop figured out very well yet.
21,2015-10-02T20:54:06+00:00,explorerx4,Timely comment by me!
22,2015-10-03T01:01:26+00:00,fintail,"I think Hankook is used on a few other MBs too. Maybe they have a good model, or it is just another way for some suits to get a big bonus.

Start/stop on my E is pretty seamless, but it is annoying when creeping in Seattle traffic, or using a multi point turn when backing into a parking spot. Luckily, it is disabled with a simple push of a button.

Today spotted a pretty blue M235 and a GLA45 with the big dorky spoiler and a ""driver"" with a phone to his ear."
23,2015-10-04T22:58:54+00:00,fintail,Saw a Maybach S600 on the showroom floor of the local MB dealer today. MSRP ~190K IIRC. They also had a loaded up S63 into the 160s.
24,2015-10-05T01:05:39+00:00,odie6l,"I got to see a BMW i8 near Hershey today. It has to be because of the big Hershey Auto Show coming up next weekend.

Odie"
25,2015-10-05T02:10:18+00:00,fintail,"Oh yeah, at Costco saw one of the Fiat CUV things, and a surprisingly rare sight, an HRV (or they are just blending into the background)."
26,2015-10-05T02:51:46+00:00,berri,"Sadly, too many new cars seem to blend in these days Kind of takes the urgency out of buying a new one."
27,2015-10-05T19:26:53+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Can it be switched off? I haven't driven the newer version but I absolutely loved the 3.0T-6 with the Polestar tune. That sucker was silly quick.

Over the weekend I saw another GLE Coupe, an X4 and a couple of X6's . It was just that kind of sighting weekend for those. I definitely don't dislike the segment, in fact the GLE in AMG guise is pretty sweet IMO."
28,2015-10-05T19:38:56+00:00,stever,"Yeah, you can turn it off. It goes off in Sport mode too."
29,2015-10-05T20:42:39+00:00,fordgirl15,What is the sports car that looks like a camaro? I have seen it and there is no marking on it to even give you an idea of what it is. It looks like the new Chevy camaro but my dad doesn't agree with me. Maybe someone else knows.
30,2015-10-05T20:46:44+00:00,texases,A Dodge Challenger?
31,2015-10-05T20:49:20+00:00,fordgirl15,I haven't seen the new challenger yet so cudnt say. It was red and had a black gas cover. I looked up the camaro and that's what it looked like. I'll look at the challenger.
32,2015-10-05T20:51:54+00:00,fordgirl15,It doesn't look like the challenger. The front didn't hardly look like a camaro but the shape was camaro. If that helps any!
33,2015-10-05T20:53:16+00:00,stever,Corvette?
34,2015-10-05T20:55:13+00:00,fordgirl15,Too big for a corvette. It almost looked like a mix of different models in the sports car world.
35,2015-10-05T21:38:56+00:00,stickguy,Hyundai Genesis coupe?
36,2015-10-05T21:46:14+00:00,fordgirl15,"Nope. Ok. Let me get myself straight. It was the shape of a MUSTANG, had the front of a DODGE, but it looked like a camaro. Bigger than the corvette. Ok. So it almost looked like a cross between Ford, dodge, Chevy. Like I said there was no marking to distinguish it from other sports car. It was a sports car. I have only seen one other one besides that one."
37,2015-10-05T21:50:13+00:00,stever,Have you been listening to Johnny Cash again?
38,2015-10-05T22:05:39+00:00,fordgirl15,Lol! No! Why??!!:-)
39,2015-10-05T22:13:49+00:00,stever,Is this warmer or cooler?
40,2015-10-05T22:13:52+00:00,texases,Nissan GT-R?
41,2015-10-05T22:14:37+00:00,fordgirl15,Cooler
42,2015-10-05T22:15:53+00:00,fordgirl15,No. Don't look like it. Sorry if you are getting fed up. Or maybe this is providing a challenge for you.
43,2015-10-05T22:17:19+00:00,explorerx4,"New small Porsche CUV while I was out walking. Somehow, they got it to sound like it has a flat 6. It doesn't right?
Yesterday driving by the back lot of a car dealer a Super Duty 4x4 on 4 vertical 4x4's (someone stole the wheels)."
44,2015-10-06T00:18:34+00:00,kyfdx,"Nope... it's a turbo V-6, I'm pretty sure"
45,2015-10-06T01:10:43+00:00,fintail,"Today saw an F-type cabrio, facelift Bentley Continental, newer Stingray."
46,2015-10-06T11:42:02+00:00,odie6l,"Was it one of the Pontiac Trans Am body kits?



Odie"
47,2015-10-06T13:01:54+00:00,fordgirl15,Looks like you might be a little closer.
48,2015-10-06T13:56:54+00:00,tjc78,That body kit is ummm... interesting.
49,2015-10-06T14:02:40+00:00,fordgirl15,"Odie, I think you answered my question! Just looked at the back end of it and I think that was what it was! Thanks! So what wud you say the make and model is?"
0,2015-10-06T14:26:15+00:00,robr2,Both Trans Am Depot and Lingenfelter are offering kits to convert the current Camaro to various generations of the Trans Am and the former also offers a kit to make a GTO.
1,2015-10-06T14:27:48+00:00,fordgirl15,Interesting! That's cool to know.
2,2015-10-06T16:21:15+00:00,odie6l,"I know some will bash me for this, but you have to admit the T-Tops work on it. I bet with todays tech, they had to have fixed the leaking problem from models past. I bet it would be a popular option if it was available on the Camaro.

Odie"
3,2015-10-06T16:24:46+00:00,odie6l,"It is still titled as a Camaro, but I think you can have it retitled as a Trans Am, but has to keep the Chevrolet Manufacturer on the title. As for the price, you have to pay the extra over the price of the Camaro too and they run around $65k total (kit & car) to start.

4,2015-10-06T20:15:55+00:00,anythngbutgm,Warmer? That thing is smoking hot!
5,2015-10-06T20:26:25+00:00,anythngbutgm,"IIRC, the majority of the problems with T-Tops was the structural rigidity of the car itself rather than things like the design of the seals or the gap tolerances. For instance, from what I recall, Nissan offered the T-top option in the Datsun 240 all the way up to the 300 ZX and there was no problems with structural rigidity and body twist. But I did have a friend with a 300ZX TT that his T-Tops suddenly never fit right after owning it for years. But he took that thing to the NE Dragway a few times and I'm sure it had it's share of flogging in the corners as well...

But with the growing interest in weight savings, it may be A. too costly to engineer the car to overcome the body twist or B. the weight of the glass or the effects of the glass on the cG of the vehicles is not worth the effort.

IMO, the T-Top thing is a fad that will remain in the history books...

Now with that, I'll be VERY curious about the structural rigidity of Teslas new Model X with the Gull Wing Doors and whether that design will see the same issues as traditional T-Tops."
6,2015-10-06T23:10:44+00:00,explorerx4,Some current cars have convertible in mind when designed. A CamaroBird might be ok with T-Tops.
7,2015-10-07T01:10:36+00:00,fintail,"Not new, but I think I saw about 15 Teslas today on my ~4 mile jog. It was like there was a convention in town."
8,2015-10-09T16:29:44+00:00,carnaught,It's kinda weird that I see more Teslas when out on a typical outing than I do new Ford Tauruses.
9,2015-10-09T19:50:38+00:00,fintail,"I definitely do, as the market in my area largely abandoned fullsized American cars years ago.

Saw 2x BMW M235, blue and red."
10,2015-10-10T02:30:04+00:00,berri,just go over a county or two from King
11,2015-10-15T00:45:23+00:00,fintail,"I guess with the size of some counties here, you could end up in Yakima or Spokane and see more.

Today saw a nice C450 with a 60K MSRP and a high option C63 with 86K MSRP.

Saw a loaded"
12,2015-10-15T15:52:59+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"As you might guess from looking at this Tesla Distribution Map, most of them reside in heavily populated metro areas. Surprised to see Atlanta stepping out. Also surprised to see so few in groovy uber-rich Boulder.

Tesla doesn't have to worry so much about leaking roofs. Tesla has to worry about making a profit for the first time."
13,2015-10-15T16:05:26+00:00,qbrozen,"well, we can say that most who have chosen to report themselves to that website live somewhere near a heavily populated metro area. I see MANY in my neck of the woods, which is 1 hour from both NYC and Philly. Certainly way more than the few people who reported to that website. Maybe those in uber-rich Boulder just have better things to do than give their info to some website dude. haha."
14,2015-10-15T16:43:03+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Hard to say what's going on. In some uber-rich, ultra green communities, it's not cool to be too ostentatious. You drive a humble Subaru but fly off to a one-month luxury tent trek in Mongolia.

re: Jaguar F Type -- what I really like about the car is how it sounds, especially the ""R""."
15,2015-10-15T18:03:36+00:00,fintail,"Not surprised by that map, I feel like I live near Tesla HQ sometimes, I see at least a dozen of these a day now. On a per capita basis, this area has to be among the top. I see a lot of greenie rich aging techie types who sure as hell love to show off a bit. Time to end those undeserved tax breaks.

I am most surprised to see central FL so high, but then again with a largeish population and a banana republic style socio-economic structure, there is a decent enough sized group at the top who can pull it off I guess."
16,2015-10-15T18:54:54+00:00,bhill2,Want to bet that cluster in Eastern WA is in the tri-cities?
17,2015-10-15T19:05:36+00:00,fintail,"That and Spokane, for sure. Some money in both places, and enough population to have people into it."
18,2015-10-15T19:53:44+00:00,ab348,What is the source of wealth in the tri-cities? The one time I spent some time there it did not seem particularly prosperous.
19,2015-10-15T20:00:07+00:00,stever,"Bioremediation pays well I think. Just don't drink the water.

New Sedona and Soul yesterday, both with temp plates. The Korean brands seem to do well in this town, but not as well as muscle cars."
20,2015-10-15T21:25:33+00:00,stickguy,"I see tons of new kias. They come into Philly now (the transport ships) and the storage/prep lots are right down by the river, under one of the bridges. They are spreading down there like Kudzu. I have no clue how they keep track of them all, but they have to keep scraping together more parking for them all.

cool site coming over the bridge, looking down on 1,000s of cars still with the while plastic on them."
21,2015-10-15T21:29:22+00:00,robr2,Zoom in and you can see exactly where the Tesla is. I was surprised that the 1 one in my town was listed as being at a Shell station.
22,2015-10-15T22:08:49+00:00,bhill2,"Well, the Hanford facility is there and nuclear workers get paid pretty well. But I was thinking more of the nerd factor, which is through the roof."
23,2015-10-15T22:26:20+00:00,fintail,"I think some large companies have locations there, wikipedia probably lists it. An old school friend of mine lives there - he can work from home, and his wife works at Hanford. The house they bought for 300K would be 1MM++ where I live, which was a key motivator - not a bad place to raise kids."
24,2015-10-16T02:15:21+00:00,berri,"Do the nuke workers there need lights, or is their glow sufficient at night As I recall, there have been lot of issues and problems at those facilities."
25,2015-10-16T04:39:36+00:00,bhill2,"When I worked at the facility I got a yellow tee shirt with a purple radiation symbol that said ""In case of a power failure, stand next to me; I glow in the dark."" I heard that if you wore it to work you would be fired. Never tried it, but 35 years later I still have the shirt.

Oh Fin; at least when I was there it was indeed a great place to raise kids. Unfortunately, there were about 3 guys for every girl and I didn't make the cut."
26,2015-10-17T16:39:52+00:00,fintail,"For people who worked at the main facility in the past, there were many problems yes - it is public sector after all, you'll run into ineptitude and a lack of accountability, as people in charge effectively can't be fired. But the facility is huge and employs a lot of people. It will probably never really be cleaned up or out of operation."
27,2015-10-17T16:42:12+00:00,fintail,"Affordable housing can do a lot if you can find a good job. I could deal with living in eastern WA, as I spent a bit of my youth there and I generally like the climate. The Seattle-Bellevue-Redmond style jobs aren't easy to find there yet though.

I spent a bit of my childhood in Moses Lake. It was a good place for kids at the time too. Maybe not as great now - lots of gang/drug activity there. Still afforable housing anyway.

I am in a small western WA town now, no new cars here, but I saw a new Ducati Scrambler of all things yesterday."
28,2015-10-22T00:47:50+00:00,PF_Flyer,"Saw a Nissan Leaf on the road today. Second one I've seen, but this one was the first local owner. I may have to check back with them to see how it handles our winter."
29,2015-10-22T00:50:06+00:00,fintail,"Today - new facelift Accord, CX-3 that looked like it would fit inside the Graf Zeppelin Q7 behind it, S550 coupe, C450 on the road, and a BMW S1000R - not the RR, but the more upright R, which I like a lot."
30,2015-10-22T20:00:32+00:00,anythngbutgm,My wife has a customer with one and supposedly it's a tank in the winter. She loves it and has no issue en the N.E. winters and that was coming from a RAV4 before it.
31,2015-10-22T20:01:47+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Spotted a new Q7 yesterday. Certainly rides lower than the last model, about the same height as the Allroad but with a taller roofline."
32,2015-10-22T21:00:51+00:00,robr2,Saw an S65 today at the local dealership. The PDR guy was massaging the hood. He better be good - it was a black vehicle and any little imperfection will really show.
33,2015-10-22T22:36:16+00:00,PF_Flyer,I'm thinking more along the lines of the effects of cold and snow on the range
34,2015-10-22T22:43:35+00:00,explorerx4,"Over the weekend, a Black Bentley convertible with the top down during snow flurries, driving up our street."
35,2015-10-22T23:46:32+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"BMW 650i convertible. Nice looking car but with the top up, those ""flying buttress"" C pillars are pretty unattractive."
36,2015-10-23T00:07:08+00:00,PF_Flyer,"Doing a road trip to DE this weekend, so who knows what I might see"
37,2015-10-23T01:14:17+00:00,fintail,"I suspect the depreciation curve for a loaded 6er cabrio is like a stone thrown off a cliff.

MB day today - current style E63, W222 S63, W222 S65 (the big money)."
38,2015-10-23T13:55:49+00:00,odie6l,"Were you in Hershey? I saw a Bentley Convert as well on wed. with the top down cruising around like nothing else mattered in the world.

Odie"
39,2015-10-23T20:16:14+00:00,explorerx4,"@odie6l,
Not in Hershey, in central CT."
40,2015-10-29T01:32:19+00:00,fintail,"Saw a P85D today (I usually don't even look at the badge, but I did for unknown reasons), must be the diesel model"
41,2015-10-29T22:43:54+00:00,bhill2,Please. We're talking about a breakthrough car here. It's diesel-electric
42,2015-10-30T01:53:32+00:00,berri,Sounds like a railroad engine drivetrain
43,2015-10-30T03:04:08+00:00,fintail,"That'd be cool. Diesel hybrids exist. Doubt they'd get the tax help though.

A friend of mine excitedly texted me to say he saw a BMW 340i on the road."
44,2015-10-30T16:44:44+00:00,explorerx4,A new black Miata convertible. Looks like how I picture a small Jag convertible.
45,2015-10-31T04:30:10+00:00,stickguy,I saw one miata on the road. Red. Did not realize any other colors were out yet.
46,2015-11-02T13:49:38+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Saw a new Miata as well, also in red. Still not a fan of the looks.

In the obscure sightings column, I actually saw an Isuzu Axiom over the weekend as well. I remember thinking how odd and over the top futuristic it looked when it came to market, now it just looks cheap and outdated."
47,2015-11-02T14:39:40+00:00,Michaell,"I saw an Axiom over the weekend as well .. wasn't that one of the first vehicles available with direct injection?

Also saw a lovely 70's Riviera - the generation after the boattail."

49,2015-11-02T15:03:30+00:00,qbrozen,"I thought the Axiom was interesting, too."
0,2015-11-02T20:17:14+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I think the criticism was more with the fact that it didn't look like a traditional SUV like the Explorer, Durango, Jeeps, Pathfinders, 4Runners etc. that were so wildly popular when the SUV craze started taking off. And it wasn't really as sleek and luxurious as the early entries to the soft roader segment by Lexus (first RX300 was a breakout hit) Acura, who released the first gen and also wildly successful MDX the same year. To me, that front clip was polarizing in the same way the Jeep Cherokee is when I see one or even Isuzu's own Vehicross when it was out.

IIRC, didn't it consist of a lot of shared parts from the Rodeo?"
1,2015-11-02T20:21:20+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Looks like you are correct, wikpedia says it received DI in 2004."

7,2015-11-09T18:53:14+00:00,fintail,"Saw a ghastly orange-ish G63 AMG at a MB dealer, and a new style Q7 on the road. Quite a few new style Smarts around, too."
8,2015-11-10T02:24:59+00:00,berri,"I sometimes see a Smart when I'm in places like Seattle or San Francisco. It always raises the philosophical question to me as to what is ""smart"" about it?"
9,2015-11-10T04:20:16+00:00,stickguy,"not that rare, but I saw a bevy of Mazda 6's today. In about a 3 block stretch by my neighborhood, I saw 3 different ones. Must have been a convention."
10,2015-11-10T14:22:57+00:00,tjc78,"New Maxima in the parking lot at work. Looks sharp, but the front ""buck tooth"" is meh. IMO the manufacturers are struggling in the front end department. It seems we either get downright funky or big mouth bass."

22,2015-11-11T19:50:12+00:00,ab348,Looks to be a plumped-up C-class design. Not sure I like that sloping tail.

New S and C (they are everywhere here too) are big hits, the company likely assumes this will translate to E sales."

26,2015-11-14T04:45:26+00:00,stickguy,"so, got to check out a new Tuscan today. In the showroom, while I waited for my Sonata to get serviced. Looks nice. Classier interior. terrible looking rear visibility. Should do well.

but, I immediately crossed it off the list. Failed the headrest test. Way too big and pushed forward. Felt like someone was shoving a football against my head. Oh well. Plenty of other choices!

In October, the ForTwo sold how many in the USA? Guess.......it's 721 units. And THAT was among their best months for 2015. July was 441."

29,2015-11-15T00:52:58+00:00,robr2,"Saw the new Civic at the local dealership. It didn't look as good in person as in the photos. Also, the new wing across it and the Accord protrudes a bit too far for my taste."
30,2015-11-16T18:41:12+00:00,tifighter,Saw the new Tacoma on the road. Black extended cab. I found the looks to be...challenging.
31,2015-11-17T16:02:31+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"The polite term when addressing the new owner is ""Oh, that's an interesting effort""."
32,2015-11-18T18:19:54+00:00,fintail,Spotted a PINK CLS350 Bluetec Shooting Brake in the hotel parking garage - not the best choice.

34,2015-11-18T22:48:22+00:00,tifighter,"Saw a few of these CLS shooting brakes in Zurich two weeks ago. For sure it is nice, but I can't say I'm a huge fan. Like the E wagon, though."

CLS shooting brake has been around for a couple years. The surprising one is the CLA shooting brake - I've seen a number of them. It seems droopy like the CLA sedan. Rounded shooting brake designs are hard to pull off.

Here's an oddball - MB E200 Natural Gas."
36,2015-11-19T19:30:14+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Saw not one, but 2 different Chevy's this week, on Monday I saw a new Volt. This one was Blue, not bad looking if a bit derivative of a new Honda Civic.

Then this morning I got behind this white sedan that looked kinda like a new 200C but almost looked like a knockoff like something out of China. So I got closer and low and behold it was a brand new Malibu. Impression of it was meh, looks like a rental car... And with a really dopey looking front end...

39,2015-11-20T01:57:41+00:00,Michaell,"Starting to trickle onto the lots, it seems."
40,2015-11-20T12:41:44+00:00,robr2,I stopped at the local Honda store last week. They had about 10 new Civics in stock. They show 76 units in stock across their 4 locations.
41,2015-11-20T14:21:18+00:00,qbrozen,"Spotted my first S-class coupe. I was approaching from behind and had no idea what it was until I got a look at the badges. An S550 4matic, to be precise. Not bad looking from the back. Still not sure what the interest is in such a large 2-door, though.

I guess this one has been around about a year, but this is definitely the first I've seen in the wild. Wonder how many they have sold."
42,2015-11-20T18:03:48+00:00,fintail,"Selling quite a few in the Seattle area, anyway. I have seen several new S-coupe in Germany, too. The interest is in the style, and the $$$. And to a point, it is 8/10ths of the panache of a Bentley for a lot less money.

Saw a Tesla in Zurich, and speaking of Volt, the unusual Opel Ampera. Also 3 non-taxi Lexus. a record. Approximately 2 minutes worth back home. A couple of RX in city traffic and a CT going really slow on the highway."
43,2015-11-21T04:47:55+00:00,tlong,Saw a new Volt on the road today. Looks quite a bit nicer on the outside IMHO than the old one.
44,2015-11-21T16:50:11+00:00,fintail,Saw another Lexus today. One. I was on the road for hours. It's a different world.
45,2015-11-21T22:20:58+00:00,explorerx4,A white Miata convertible and a black Jag XF convertible. Both looked good in their own way.

Yeah, it was in the Bond flick - the chances of actually seeing one here are pretty slim."
47,2015-11-23T13:38:55+00:00,anythngbutgm,So how was Spectre anyways? I saw it opened at #2 this weekend and made something like 14 mil in the US. Kinda mediocre for an opening weekend.
48,2015-11-23T15:18:04+00:00,robr2,"Actually, it's the 3rd weekend for Spectre. It did $70.4 million the first weekend, $35 it's second. This past weekend it had to deal with Katniss and JLaw in a leather catsuit will always win over Daniel Craig."
49,2015-11-23T16:05:33+00:00,stever,"I heard that the reviews were so-so. My wife didn't think it was all that good (usual gratuitous violence) but I enjoyed it a lot.

7,2015-11-27T22:19:28+00:00,ab348,"Not particularly rare, but new to me today - a Fiat 500 Abarth Essence, black, red stripe, black wheels but looked like it just rolled out of a showroom, not a speck of dirt on it. Still a bit of a goofy thing, but this one was really eye-catching. Nicely done."
8,2015-11-28T16:43:29+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,That Abarth has a wicked exhaust note for such a tiny little toaster.
9,2015-11-28T17:24:37+00:00,stever,Must use really good speakers for the exhaust note.

28,2015-12-02T14:46:02+00:00,PF_Flyer,That roll bar reminds me a lot of the Avalanche
29,2015-12-02T22:53:26+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Didn't that thing kind of flop?
30,2015-12-02T23:14:34+00:00,stickguy,never made any sense to me. especially the bizarre midgate.

It has a lot of electrical problems but he loves it so much he keeps nursing it along while driving an F-150 as his main ride. He's a big camper/kayaker outdoorsy guy and loves all the cubbies for stashing gear. He really hated to hear they quit making them.

Oh, the midgate was especially cool - he could stash his longer boats in the short bed with a couple feet of the kayak(s) in the cab and cover the whole shebang."

No separate cab and bed, and it was basically a Suburban with a bed carved out of the back. They had a very loyal following by owners. I was set to buy one of the last 2013 models, but unfortunately GM hadn't done much since 2007 to update the rig since it was slated for extinction and I moved to the Ford camp for an F-150. Sold the Av at 8 yrs and 53K in mint condition to a guy who works for me. I see it every day, but it's not nearly as clean as when I had it. I have to just look the other way now...."

One was driving a 98 Accord similar to the (2) that I owned in the past, one person had a current body Fusion-Martin and another had a last gen Rentibu.

In higher trim lines it actually looks decent, pretty unique for the segment. Mini-Crosstour, yes but it translates well to the smaller car.

Also noticed quite a few new XC90's. Handsome looking SUV, I'm really curious what they do with the XC60 which is still competitive but now going on 6 years old... Oh and also saw one of those Cross Country S60's which if there was ever an ode to those Subaru Legacy Outback sedans, it was this."

44,2015-12-07T19:51:45+00:00,robr2,"It's Volvo. It'll be 10 model years old when it is replaced - just about their average.

Based on their plan, the just introduced XC90 will be the oldest vehicle in their lineup in 2018. The next XC60 - along with the S60 and V60 - will all be on the same platform and the next S40. V40. XC40 running on another new platform."

Today I saw another newly styled not boring! RX and although not new, the Kia K9 (yes I know) is worth mention."

12,2015-12-10T04:37:19+00:00,fintail,"I never said I liked it just that it has more styling - which is a Lexus selling point these days. I am sure it is an excellent vehicle for its purpose, and will be as reliable as one can imagine.

Kia K900 will be a future once in a blue moon car, if it isn't already - I appreciate the obscure"

18,2015-12-11T01:20:39+00:00,Sandman6472,"Have seen a few new Civic's at the Honda store where we have our Hertz kiosk. They have one in the showroom right now, locked up tight, an EX-L I think which stickers for over $30K...absolutely nuts!! They do have a $1495 appearance package which I'd just ignore personally. Just haven't come to terms with the look of it though. Like the dash and the single digital speedo but the outside looks a bit to transformerish, at least to my eyes. I've only owned one Honda, my 2006 LX, and still don't get the whole ""Honda thing"". It was an adequate vehicle, ran pretty well except for a few recalls and problems that were anything but ""Hondaish"". Corporate only stepped up and paid for half of those ""issues"" which left me a bit unhappy to say the least since I had always heard how bullet proof they were...mine certainly was not! Got rid of it with just under 47K on the clock two years back and don't miss it all that much to be honest.
The only Honda that interests me now is the HR-V but until they put knobs back on their infotainment systems, they will not see any of my greenbacks! There are just too many other better vehicles out there now to be honest. Honda should really be keeping their eyes on Hyundai/Kia as they are doing some amazing things with their vehicles. Honda, and Toyota for that matter, should keep a very very close eye!!

I've had a really good record with all three of my Kia's. For the money paid and IMO the body design, Long-Haul Warranty and engineering, Kia's are hard ta beat. I prefer Kia styling over Hyundai styling or I would totally include Hyundai in my argument."

For some unknown reason, cuv's are particularly popular down South here and hey, even I was bitten with the bug for a little more than a year back at the end of 2013 before I came back to my senses and went back down to a small vehicle.

I agree, sandman. I am going to lightly research this new Mazda CX-3, mainly because I was really wanting their new Mazda 2 hatchback. And yes, that is exactly what the new CX-3 is. But I won't give Mazda $25,000 or over for the cool little hatchback. I do like how they designed the little zoom-zoomer.

But the larger rigs are for someone else, my rigs need ta be small, maneuverable rigs. Them are me favorites."

41,2015-12-17T15:34:26+00:00,stickguy,"G37 I think is about 184""? Not really much bigger than a Jetta. That size range is fine to me. The ""mama bear"" size."

But seriously, a LOT of ideas have been tried already, so we are down to variations on themes. Maybe fins aren't going to come back, but some vestige or variation of fins in combination with other design elements could lead to something that's pleasing to the eye. Sometimes the attempt isn't quite a box office boffo smash (think Aztek) but I like that they at least tried. I really didn't like it when everyone was on the aerodynamic jellybean kick and all the cars were starting to look like Tauruses that had gotten different amounts of water!"

Regarding TV, indeed, reality is cheaper - no actors, no special effects, no highly developed scripts (just lowly developed scripts). And the masses watch it. The old timers who grew up in such a more strenuous education environment (yeah right) are still in control and are approving all this stuff, you know."
10,2015-12-21T18:27:13+00:00,berri,I just can't fathom how people can watch these cable channels of the same show over and over on a given night. Maybe I've just got ADD or something.

The show about the wilderness homesteaders is typical of the fakery. We've stayed at that place (Jewel's family owns it), and it's like 7 seven miles down a paved road from Homer. When you get bored from filming, you can pop into the Salty Dawg for a brew in about ten minutes. ."

15,2015-12-21T21:03:43+00:00,fintail,"House Hunters and similar shows are just propaganda for the real estate and connected industries. There's a large and financially influential/controlling demographic out there who is addicted to houses and all that stuff, so it works. Keeps the money flowing. Eventually you get an economy dependent on it.

Saw a new RX slowly going around a corner, followed by a loud HONK that made me laugh. Also a new XC90, this one caught my eye as it had very noticeable rear bumper fitment issues. I assume it got hit (or backed into something, this is Bellevue) rather than was made that way."

4,2016-01-11T14:36:35+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Saw quite a few RAV4 hybrids this weekend. Also saw (2) new GLE Mercs, non-coupe flavor.

Supposedly there will be an X2 in the BMW camp, so the Coupe-Crossover isn't going away any time soon. I actually really dig the GLE Coupe myself.

Lastly, I spotted (2) new Audi Q7's. European SUV's are really popular around here. Not Honda Pilot or Explorer popular, but they are prevalent."
5,2016-01-12T02:17:19+00:00,fintail,"Not new, but amusing and I don't know where else to put it. Yesterday I saw a previous gen Acura TL, with the beak - this one had a ""full Florida"" treatment including a very padded cabrio look top with blanked out rear quarters, and chrome wheels. Wacky."

7,2016-01-12T17:03:49+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Never understood why anyone in his right mind thought a Murano cabriolet was a good idea.
8,2016-01-12T17:05:56+00:00,stever,"Off road convertible that's a bit more comfy than a Wrangler? Actually thought it'd be good for snow country. High clearance and AWD for pushing through the drifts, and then drop the top in the Spring and Fall. Save a space in your garage."

14,2016-01-16T02:56:23+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new style 7er on the road today, without the chrome hockey stick it would be hard to notice."
15,2016-01-19T01:35:00+00:00,fintail,"Saw an i8 on the road today, and a big mouth bass Prius C, likely a rental."
16,2016-01-19T22:21:13+00:00,tifighter,"Last week, I saw an i8 and a Fisker Karma within 2 minutes while driving through, wait for it, Puyallup. Definitely a WTH moment."

18,2016-01-20T22:24:27+00:00,tifighter,Maybe. Saw my first Model X today in Mercer Island. White. That makes more sense.
19,2016-01-21T02:18:31+00:00,fintail,"Good sighting, haven't seen one of those Faberge eggs yet. Most remarkable thing I saw today was a Lexus NX that was actually being driven in a mildly lively manner."
20,2016-01-21T06:13:58+00:00,tifighter,"Yeah, the white color does nothing to dispel the egg analogy. I was driving with my wife; when I pointed it out to her, she commented about how not special it looked."
21,2016-01-23T16:38:20+00:00,Sandman6472,"That's why I like my blue on my Golf especially with the 17"" Joda wheels...have gotten a few comments at gas stations while pumping petrol and even a few at the supermarket. I did consider red for a nano second but it's really red and thought I'd stick out a bit. With the right alloys, the white would look great to. I know on our A3, the white fits it and the nice lines of the vehicle. After having silver vehicles for so long, decided I'd get something totally different, the white was all the dealer had with the options the wife wanted last December. We had a white Cutlass Supreme back in 1985 with a blue vinyl roof and blue interior and come to think of it, I had a '96 white over blue Corolla, so we have done white also. One tends to forget after awhile what vehicles one owned over the years.

29,2016-01-25T18:20:20+00:00,fintail,"Normal GLE is just the new name for the ML - they will sell them by the boatload. GLE coupe is MBs version of the X6, and will sell to a much smaller customer base. I think I have seen maybe 5 on the road so far."
30,2016-01-26T17:43:28+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, I meant the GLE coupe. I can't imagine why anyone would want one, nor can I imagine why Benz (or BMW) even builds things like this. Have they all gone ""niche-crazy""?"
31,2016-01-26T18:12:16+00:00,texases,"Yeah, and BMW's the worst niche maker. How many 3/4 series variants are out there? A dozen?"
32,2016-01-26T18:17:13+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"How ironic that the Germans are trying to replicate the AMC Eagle for $70,000 bucks."
33,2016-01-26T18:27:05+00:00,fintail,"There's a segment of the affluent who like homely brash jerky cars - enter the X6. They are often driven by a specific demographic here. MB saw that BMW is likely earning good margins on those, so they made their own. BMW and MB are trying to out-niche each other, and it has come to the point where they sometimes simply copy each other.

Subaru replicated the AMC Eagle best, for a mere ~30K."
34,2016-01-27T01:56:37+00:00,fintail,"And what did I see this afternoon - white GLE coupe, and the driver was the expected demographic."

36,2016-01-27T19:29:24+00:00,fintail,"Nah, just showy, and probably lucky at receiving gifts. Their prior car might have been an X6."
37,2016-01-28T00:18:55+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Oh, it shows something all right. More dollars than sense."
38,2016-01-28T01:44:38+00:00,fintail,"That sums up a lot of people with a lot of dollars in my area.

44,2016-01-29T01:32:39+00:00,fintail,"I saw what appeared to be an X4M today - looked like it had the badging, and it was launching with the subtle non-dbaggy 5K off the line jump typical for many M car drivers around here. Also a Kia K-9(00)."

Speaking of that garage, saw a new unplated A5 cabrio there today."

19,2016-02-10T19:00:58+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"San Francisco is a small city---kind of a toy city a rich man might buy his kid for Christmas. So an electric car makes more sense here. In L.A., people drive 100 miles for a good taco."
20,2016-02-10T23:37:50+00:00,tlong,"Agreed, but the Bay Area is the entire peninsula down to Silicon Valley, plus the east bay. My sightings pertain to the entire area from SFO down to San Jose."
21,2016-02-11T01:52:02+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"That's more wide open than a large metropolis, that's true, but still pretty dense. SFO to San Jose is only 35 miles. Even a Nissan Leaf can do that round trip. I don't know about southern Cal, but in the South Bay / East Bay corridor I do see a lot of charging stations in shopping centers. It's very ""groovy/greenie"" up here."
22,2016-02-11T06:18:55+00:00,tlong,Plenty of high cost vehicles in the Bay Area. I think when you see a US-nameplate sedan it's usually a rental.

Just the ELR plugged in to a facsimile charging station. Have they killed it? I thought they skipped the 2015 model to bring out an improved '16, at a lower price. But, with yesterday's Volt mechanicals. Still gonna be a tough sell at $65k, if it is still with us."

Quite understandable as she's not as happy as I am with our vehicles, that old appliance thinking creeping back in I suspect. Cars just don't mean that much to her, and never had.
I, on the other hand, tried to convince her otherwise, that we need to take a more real time view at that time. If things are fine, why rock the boat. But she brought up the cost of repairs, etc., things I hadn't thought about since things are all good right now. Again I said, let's wait till that time comes and see where we're at, then go from there. Just want to enjoy these first couple years of ownership, before the need for new tires and such.

43,2016-02-13T22:07:29+00:00,stever,"Not new but odd. We live in a neighborhood that you access by a long, dead-end paved road up against the Organ Mountains. You can't go over the mountains even on foot, because it's fenced and guarded by the folks at White Sands Missile Range. Most all the side roads are gravel.

So last night coming home we got behind a semi-sized car carrier with six newer used SUVs and sedans on it. I was tempted to follow it but he was doing 30 in a 45 and so I passed him. If he's a neighborhood curbstoner, he's sure got the rig for it."
44,2016-02-13T22:57:22+00:00,stickguy,probably someone getting a car delivered? Could be a shipping company.

At first I figured he'd gotten off the Interstate and the GPS steered him wrong, but when he made the turn into our area, I assumed he wasn't lost."
46,2016-02-14T16:06:15+00:00,berri,"Those guys, if you can find one, have a long clock. Once had a car picked up at almost 10pm while it was snowing."
47,2016-02-16T18:02:58+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Bit surpised that I counted/spotted (8) different new Prius's this weekend. Gotta say in some colors the styling is not as offensive as I would have thought. From a side view, the nose and hood have a similar profile to a Mazda RX-8 and the tail certainly won't be mistaken for anything else...

My neighbor got a new MB GLE, I believe it replaced a current gen Explorer. Another neighbor got a new Mitsubushi Outlander (with ""100 new improvements"") which looks to have replaced a GM C Terrain. It definitely is an improvement in styling , those Terrains are the fugliest new vehicle on the road IMO, especially in base trim which he had...

Also spotted a ton of new Tacomas, including one that was wearing tires you would see on a jacked up F-250.

Lastly, the wife and I visited an Audi dealer this weekend to take a look around. We are really interested in the Q3 which is just the right size for her and the reviews say it's one of the most fun to drive vehicles in the class (GLA/X1/NX) but at 41g for a modestly loaded model, I think we'll just look at the X1 for the same coin."
48,2016-02-16T18:05:53+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,The GLE is no beauty queen either.

If I were to get any Prius, I'd get the 4 door wagon as thought it drove nicely and was definitely quieter. Glad my VW Golf is bringing home almost 40 mpg on my highway commute, makes getting rid of the Tucson that much better since it got under 29 for the same trip. Am using less petrol in gallons as not taking the price into account here since the amount would be the same no matter the price.

It's basically a Corolla wagon, to Scion's credit it's available with a stick shift. I like it but not a lot."

Prius C, they have to sell in significant numbers to fleets now. I still think of my friend who had one, and drove it from Atlanta to Seattle. By the end of his lease he was parking it where he thought trees might fall on it."

Even owner/operators of the very small Mitsubishi Mirage claim football-player sized men are comfortable up front driving their Mirage's. Humm."

14,2016-02-19T04:23:14+00:00,stever,"Drove a '16 Prius today - was disappointed, and was a bit surprised to be disappointed. Also drove a Dodge Caravan today (and everyday, lol, just my '09, not a new one).

Enjoyed sitting in a Scion iM. Very nice cockpit, nicely executed interior. Not ready to downsize quite that much but liked it. Also spotted a nice Blue xB with a cheap MSRP. And there was a FR-S on the Toyota lot too.

Drove a '15 Soul ! with the leather. Killer panoramic sunroof, most all of the bells and whistles (including those darn 18"" wheels). I was ready to talk numbers when my wife brought me back down to earth a bit.

Then drove a '16 Soul + with the killer panoramic sunroof. Went around the block and I looked up and got blinded. This one also had leather but it was the thicker ""base"" leather (per the salesperson) and the ventilated seats didn't seem to work as well as the seat in the '15 did.

My guess is that we could save a couple of thousand bucks going for the '15 vs a '16 ! with similar options. But since we drive them forever, I kind of want the newest I can get - the price over ten years is only an extra $200 a year.

Wish the mpg was better but I like the box and I like the higher seating position of the Soul. Kia really needs to take a page from Buick - the very nice Encore gets 28/34 while the Kia only gets 24/31."
15,2016-02-19T04:51:49+00:00,Michaell,"Thanks for the update on the shopping.

Doesn't the Soul ! have the more powerful engine? 2.4L with 160-170 HP?"

As often as my eyes stray to the Scion iA soon-ta-be Toyota iA or this little orange '68 Datsun 411 Bluebird, I love my small clear white Soul from Kia. I don't know why I can't seem ta just stay content with it, it is a ""lower end"" rig, but, I wouldn't want a Scion xB box, either. I don't like how they look. We just went over 60,000 miles in our Soul, too.

And since it's ""our"" money, I can't just swing deals however and whenever I want. I know one thing I ought ta be very thankful for, and it's this: because of the Mrs. and her stance on flinging cash at different new and used rigs I fall in love with, we've got more retirement nest tucked away for that special 'R' time coming up. We'd both like ta head back to either New Mexico or Arizona.

Concerning spending on new rigs (or used) and just doing it come hell or high water, when I decided I wanted to trade our 2001 Kia Sportage 4X4 in on a new model of car, the 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS, I just planned it all out, grabbed a spring coat and the Sportage keys one Saturday afternoon and headed for the front door of the house.

""Where ya goin'?""
""I'm goin' ta get a new Mitsubishi!""
Her response ta this insanity?

""I'm comin' with!"" Couldn't believe it - but, no matter what her response was, I was going to go get my own ""baby EVO."" We got up to Avondale, which is about 9 miles west of Phoenix, headed in to Avondale Mitsubishi, I told them that I had talked to them earlier on the phone about a new '08 Lancer GTS in Rally Red paint and 5-speed transmission. The kid greets me and said it's in the showroom. It was an automatic CVT transmission. I was livid!

""Didn't I say I wanted a stick shift Rally Red Lancer GTS?""
Yep - it's right there. I looked at Mrs. iluv incredulously and wanted to raise my voice. They drove it outta the showroom, we took our test drive, I loved it, and on in to negotiations we went. I just couldn't believe that the sales guy didn't get it that paddle shifters aren't the same thing as manual transmissions!"

Curb weight comes in under 3,000 pounds so that helps a bit.

@iluvmysephia1, we hit 85°F today. If you and the missus need to get out of Dodge and warm up, come on down. (Yeah, I've been waiting years to finally have someone I can feed that line too, lol).

This is the engine size and hp/ft.lb.torque our 2011 clear white base 5-speed Kia Soul is. If I get far enough on our taxes later on today I'm gonna hook my new hose up and give her a wash out the back of the house. It's a long overdue thing, the Soul is dirty outside and it also needs a vacuuming of the carpet and a wipe-down of the dash/cupholder area.

In fact, perhaps I should just start with the Soul cleaning project and then do our Fed/State income taxes after that. First things first, eh? Happy ta see you're considering a Kia Soul, stever. Hey, BTW, when the Mrs. and I were at Viva Kia (you could drive the 40 miles south ta Viva Kia in El Paso and give them a try, too, for Souls) I asked if they had any Nissan cube's available ta test drive and look at. Nope - not a one - even thought Viva Kia/Mitsubishi also sells Nissan's. Bummer dude - I really wanted ta test drive a Nissan cube - love the funky shape and design. Nissan discontinued making the cube, but, I was still interested.

Yeah, we're just 525 miles NE of Alamogordo from Dodge City, KS. And it's all on Highway 54."

21,2016-02-19T15:52:07+00:00,stever,"Yeah, and the glass also opens after you open the cover. Or at least the front half opens.

The inside cover can be partially closed (from the back to the front). Just punch the button when you want it to stop.

A sun screen would be nice addition too. Think it was the Elantra wagon we tested that had the sunroof with the sunshade, in addition to the inside cover.

You'd hate all of this iirc, since you already will lose about 4"" of headroom with the pano roof, before taking on shades.

You also lose the ability to easily add a roof rack, but I can live without those now."
22,2016-02-19T16:05:43+00:00,texases,"Yeah, that 4"" hit to headroom would likely be a deal breaker. But some of the CUVs have enough headroom, even with the now almost mandatory sunroof. I think I fit in the RDX, the Q5, and, most importantly to me, the CX-5, which is on my list. But nothing soon."

28,2016-02-22T16:16:43+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Also checked out the GLC this weekend, It looks better in person than it did in the pics, and the interior is fantastic IMO. The only thing that I would question is the 4-cylinder under the hood of a 4200lb SUV, but that's the thing these days unfortunately. Volvo, now MB... Still, at 21/28mpg, I have to wonder what those stats would be with a nice gutsy 6-cylinder as an optional/upgrade mill. Even the Acura RDX with the old J-series V6 achieves 20/29...

I have read an AMG version is coming, but I imagine a pricetag well into the 60's...

On a side note, my wife actually fell in love with a green GLA250 that the dealer had. I didn't even know that color was offered, it stood out in the see of greys and blacks around it for sure.

Also checked out the Mazda CX-3 again, man what a great looking little package and a very reasonable price loaded. Shame, as the reviews all ding it for sluggish acceleration."

The alloys give it a much better look to be honest and felt very comfy in the drivers seat. Prefer hatchbacks (5 doors) than a conventional sedan for the hauling capabilities when needed and have to have a smallish vehicle to be happy. MPG's aren't as good as my Golf and that was a big reason I swapped out for it. Since I'm up to about 13K/year, want something somewhat economical, once I stop working, don't really care if the mileage is a bit lower because my miles/year will also be going down. That's why the GLA is on my short list as with the lower miles/year, the less miles over all will be just fine. I just want the rest of the vehicles I buy to be super fun with luxury appointments as I drove econoboxes for so long just to get to this point. I feel I deserve what ever I want now in my senior years and luckily, I do not have to get any permission when I do purchase. Figure I'm paying the bills, all of them, on it so I get what I want!

I asked her what she thought about it and she said it was a ""tinny piece of crap, that can't get out of its own way"". Lol, this coming from a 4cyl Venza driver.  It must be slow as all heck.  The Venza is built like a tank, so I understand her there. "
46,2016-02-26T15:02:13+00:00,texases,Maybe that's why they're going to quit making the 200 in a couple of years...

48,2016-02-26T15:38:28+00:00,Michaell,"Both the Dart and the 200 are slated for extinction .. no plans to replace either.

FCA is on the ropes ... they can't sustain themselves selling trucks and Jeeps alone."

Yes, this is true, I found out on the Mitsubishi Mirage website I belong to - FCA has already made the decision to axe the 200 and the Dart and dedicate those production lines to SUV's and Jeep's. Interesting - the Chrysler 200 is an interesting design that I sort of like and I do think Chrysler gave it their all on that rig - automobile making is not a business for the faint-hearted...bet you've read that one before, huh?"

The Ducati selection was small - a handful of Monsters, Scramblers, and a couple Diavels (people buy these?) - Bellevue has better selection, it seems. BMW was better, S1000XR that I had never seen before, and either it or a normal S1000RR had a hangtag of 19K, yes, nineteen thousand dollars. Strong dollar huh.

Also saw a GLE coupe with one of the expected drivers, blonde woman with large sunglasses."

10,2016-02-28T04:37:29+00:00,berri,"First (that I recall) new Civic out on the road.

Some of the new ones were affected by some piston related issue, so while they were on the dealer lot, they couldn't be sold until the matter was resolved. Personally, I like it's looks better than the previous one."
11,2016-02-28T14:41:41+00:00,ab348,"Looks like Son of Crosstour to me. Not a fan, though from the straight-on front end perspective it isn't bad."
12,2016-02-28T17:51:49+00:00,Sandman6472,"Sat in the new Civic and they did a nice job with the materials. Nice seat fabric and controls had a great tactile feel to them. Vision out was excellent and bet they will sell a lot of these puppies. Also was in a HR-V EX and liked it, a lot! Only Honda I'd buy right now and if my Plan A and Plan B don't pan out in a few years, the HR-V could very well be Plan C. Liked everything including the higher seating position, the one thing I miss from the Tucson. Luckily they had steering wheel controls for the infotainment system since I think knobs are essential and will come back to most systems very soon. Pinching and using one's fingers on the screen while driving is a safety hazard to me, as bad as texting because most folks can not drive and do another task simultaneously in a safe manner, we're just not wired that way.

13,2016-02-28T18:00:57+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,The recall was about a wrist pin snap ring that could come loose....not good.
14,2016-02-28T21:22:04+00:00,ab348,Reviews of the HR-V are terrible.
15,2016-02-28T21:48:44+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Most reviews liked the car but cursed the CVT and the pokey engine.

Much more negative on the Civic than I was expecting. Had a lot of faults listed. Though interestingly enough, he was fine with the CVT (best of breed and relatively seemless or some such).

I still have not driven one but did sit in one at the car show. Better interior at least than the old model!

Oh, this was the same guy that picked the Soul as the winner of a 4 way mini CUV comparo recently."
17,2016-02-28T23:01:42+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Apparently the objection to the CVT was that combined with a pokey engine, the laboring of the CVT drives you crazy."

19,2016-03-03T14:43:03+00:00,Sandman6472,"Haven't driven either the Civic or the HR-V yet as am waiting till Hertz gets at least the new Civic in. We picked up 10 new Accords on Monday, just like we did in 2015, so know the Civic purchase will be coming soon. Like the Accord, again we did the same thing last year. So I can wait till that time for a test drive. Doubt Hertz will get any HR-V's in their fleet but will test one in due time. Not that I'd purchase but see no reason to tempt the fates here. But, if I were to buy something tomorrow, it would be the HR-V hands down as I suspect there'd be a small amount of cash plus my Golf to drive one off the lot.
Did check on CPO units of the CLA and GLA and their newness to the market place makes them still out of reach for my pocketbook, an HR-V is definitely doable but the desire is missing. After my first test drive in the Golf, I knew I was going to buy one, soon. Went back for a second test drive a few days later and walked out with a tentative signed sales order with a small down payment left to secure the exact model and to swap out the horrible stock wheels. But once the wife had purchased her A3, I knew inside that by New Years Eve, the Tucson would be gone.

42,2016-03-21T22:20:20+00:00,stickguy,I'm patiently waiting until October 2017 to find one gently used and still under warranty for a big discount. Fine by me if the tried and true current style takes a massive hit in value when the new style comes out!

48,2016-03-22T15:12:57+00:00,fintail,"I still find it funny/irritating that MB has some significant differences between US and Canadian offerings - I am unaware of any other maker doing it to this degree. From features to entire models, there are many differences. I think Canada even has different color offerings than the US. I built a loaded E550 for 86K Loonies, or about 63.5K USD - actually, not bad, as it would have cost more here."
49,2016-03-22T16:07:28+00:00,ab348,"A couple of weeks ago I discovered that Kia offers a completely different lineup for the Soul model here in Canada than it does in the US, and has different colors as well. VW and BMW also offer different color choices inside and out for their models between the two countries, although in those cases it is a far more restricted set of choices being offered in Canada, as one might expect with it being a smaller market. M-B's case is interesting in still offering the E550 here. Perhaps it is due to fleet fuel economy averages or some such, as they sell the B-series here which might make room for some thirstier models at the other end of the range."
0,2016-03-22T17:45:41+00:00,fintail,"It's funny, as MB seems to have a broader model lineup there than here - more E engine variants, SWB and LWB S, B, and maybe more. Less option variety, with more standard features - very much like MB offerings in the UK. And with the CDN $ right now, the cars there are actually cheaper than here (at least pre-tax). Strange. I see a light-medium blue for the E that isn't even offered here. It's pretty bizarre, I wonder about the logic or reason behind it. You could be right about the E550, as the only B we get is the electric, a real hen's tooth."
1,2016-03-24T18:02:32+00:00,Sandman6472,"Have seen a few B series MB down here in South Florida all with Canadian plates on them. The only exception was a used one at a local lot. I did like the little sucker and it would fit me well, but right now, am happy with what i got and see no reason to swap out again so soon. To get me to trade, the newer vehicle would have to really blow my socks off and be such a good deal, it would be crazy to pass up. Right now, there is no such vehicle and to be honest, healthwise, just don't have the strength to go looking.
The Ft. Lauderdale car show starts today, running through Sunday. Have no plans to go as of yet but if the oldest comes down, think we'll all check it out. She's about to hit 80K on her Versa SL and might be looking to trade soon. So far, it's been a great vehicle with no issues. She's fine with the CVT and lack of get up and go but advised her to look beyond the Versa Note as her next ride. So many great small vehicles out there with up to date tech, which she desperately wants. And if I were her, I'd go for a small turbo with a regular auto tranny this time.
All I can do is help her look and then negotiate...it's her cash so it's her ultimate decision.

2,2016-03-26T01:51:46+00:00,fintail,"Visited the Vancouver auto show today. Oddest thing - MB wasn't there. In a city that I used to think had the highest amount of S-class per capita in NA, the make was absent. I suspect there's some kind of disagreement going on, as it isn't like this region isn't full of the make.

Some things in my memory: I sat in a CT6 with a 101K CDN MSRP. Nice car, but that's a spicy meatball. They also had base 4cyl one (so they made one, anyway) that was maybe 25K less. There was a big Buick concept sedan, roped off. All of the RS Audis were locked, which is funny as one could sit in Maseratis and BMW M cars. Saw a Lincoln Continental and an Alfa Giulia on stands, roped off. Saw a Fiata on display and one on the road. New Chrysler Pacifica had people swarming it, but I think Canadians have always liked Mopar vans. Honda display had a motorcycle and 4 wheeler in the mix, which interested me more than the cars - same for a new KTM dirtbike in a Colorado (no hint as how they got it up there). Lexus had some kind of little IQ sized thing with a predator face, roped off, and a concept convertible. BMW had a lineup of nice loaded cars - dark blue M6 GC with polished wheels and porcelain interior was striking, New Infiniti coupe is memorable too, like a toned down Lexus. Some new model Lambos in a special display drew a crowd, along with the recent Maserarti supercar. Also saw the new Volt and a Bolt. And lots of other stuff that doesn't come to mind right now."

23,2016-04-10T03:19:18+00:00,iluvmysephia1,"I spotted my first Scion iA in the wild yesterday. It was......um.....interesting looking.

The 2016 Scion iA turned now into the 2017 Toyota Yaris iA is...unusual looking to say the least. I didn't like the front when I first saw it but do now. With this car it's the whole package that makes the car stand out as both a bargain for the money paid and a whole lotta car for the money. Push-button start, 7"" entertainment screen, backup camera, accident avoidance detection, great Bluetooth connectivity, 31 city 41 highway and all of the Mazda greatness that a great carbuilder like Mazda can put in to a car. I honestly wouldn't be doing backflips over this car if not for the Mazda connection.

I wanted a 2016 Mazda 2 hatchback and it's here as an expensive 2016 Mazda CX-3. I'm sure it's a great hatch but its about $26,000 and does not come in a MT. Eliminated! No longer in the race.

Honestly - I may just hold on to my '11 Kia Soul 5-speed base in clear white and just mile it up. If just the right wild hair should bother me I'll go trade for a '16 Scion iA or a 2017 Toyota Yaris iA. If I don't do that I'll look for an unbeatable deal on a new '16 Kia Soul 6-speed. I honestly think the Kia will be every bit of car the Scion/or Toyota is/will be. They're neck and neck! In fact, just holding on to my '11 Kia Soul 5-speed wouldn't be a bad choice. They've all gotta be inexpensive and great cars. I believe in holding carmakers to the highest standard without needlessly throwing too much money at 'em.

Keep 'em honest. I mean, I don't call gasoline ghastly for nothing. I don't hypermile, though. Give it good ghastly - feel the rpm whirrrr....no hypermiling from this Seattleite."

New One:"

38,2016-04-21T17:56:58+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,And one has to ask......but WHY?
39,2016-04-21T18:18:23+00:00,stever,Just like a Wrangler but the soft top won't rot away in three years? Quite a bit more comfy too I suppose.
40,2016-04-21T18:34:28+00:00,texases,Any other way to get a convertible that seats 4 adults?
41,2016-04-21T20:21:43+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"People aren't going to spend that much money for something that homely. At those prices, they can buy some very tasty ragtops. Sometimes automakers out-niche themselves."

44,2016-04-21T20:56:03+00:00,fintail,They will sell. Think of the same target market as the standard Evoque - high school debutantes and sorority girls with affluent fathers. At least in my area.

Called it the ""Terminal Tank"" because A. it WAS a Tank and B. it had a Terminal issue with stalling. I remember back in 1990 or so going with him to drop it off at the junkyard.

We drove in, parked it and then left in my car.

Ironically, he then bought a used 198_ Hyundai Excel which he named ""Terminal Termite"". Termite for it's size, but no Terminal issues for at least a 150k that he had it afterwards."

Joda rims I think they are called. They gave me 5 minutes to pick from 2 different rim styles and it was very difficult really as I really liked both. Mine have 15 spokes instead of the 10 I could've gotten and think I made the right decision. But when I see what I gave up, I have second thoughts. Guess it's true, the grass is always greener!
To be honest, I bought on eBay rims for my '06 Civic LX and they came from a California '05 Civic SI. Since it was a 16"" Honda wheel, I knew the offset would work which, it did. Just had to secure new lug nuts and I was on my way. Made the car look so much better to.

22,2016-05-17T20:35:56+00:00,explorerx4,First time I've seen a CT6. It was white and looked vaguely Cadillac'ish from the back.

37,2016-05-26T02:40:25+00:00,fintail,"Not sure. I googled it, Polaris is in the Costco purchase thing, so probably. The one I go usually has a Kawasaki bike of various types, and a mainstream car, Hyundai comes to mind."
38,2016-05-26T02:51:14+00:00,stever,Friend of mine spotted one at the Clarkston Washington Costco a week ago and took a pic of it. He just said it was a Polaris.

I have seen a couple of the new MB small vans lately, and saw a new Volt today."
46,2016-05-31T16:10:11+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Haven't noticed any but maybe I wasn't looking too closely. I did price one out with a few modest options and that came to $33,400 for the base trim level. Not cheap considering you could pick up a used Nissan Leaf with similar EV range for about 1/3rd the price.

Loaded up with highest trim level and options brought the MSRP to $38,600.

Ouch!"
47,2016-05-31T19:56:15+00:00,stever,"A well equipped Volt is a bit over $40,000. Before the $7,500 tax credit."

1,2016-06-01T00:34:17+00:00,fintail,"The most impressive thing about them to me is the price, and the dopey tax break. The doors are goofy (haven't seen one in the wild with open doors yet)."
2,2016-06-01T14:47:00+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah but a much more versatile and handsome car, and considerably faster in EV mode.

The Soul EV has more cargo space, however--but cost almost 2X as much as the gas Soul.

I'm not feelin' it. It's a lot of money for what you get...or rather, don't get."
3,2016-06-01T15:46:10+00:00,stever,"Yeah, I wish the local dealer would get a few in (Volts, that is).

But the Soul looks better."
4,2016-06-01T16:15:39+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Well I guess if you want to drive a hamster cage.
5,2016-06-01T16:19:42+00:00,stever,"I really should go youtube some of those hamster ads; don't recall ever seeing one.

Was behind a new CR-V yesterday with temp tags on it. I understand the appeal, but they don't grab us."
6,2016-06-01T16:42:05+00:00,imidazol97,I just priced a Soul EV+ and it's up to $38500.
7,2016-06-01T16:44:06+00:00,stever,"Before the tax credit, lol.

The one we want runs about $26.5 OTD. Exclaim, Premium, Umber 1."
8,2016-06-01T17:15:25+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Driving a Soul EV rather than a gas Soul would save you $792 a year, for 12,000 miles a year with a KwH costing .15 cents per, and gasoline at $3 a gallon.

So the $12,000 differential paid for the EV will be equalized in about 180,000 miles.

Makes sense"
9,2016-06-01T18:05:34+00:00,stever,"Hm, interesting. That's about ten years assuming we stuck to one car (and had no range anxiety).

That's about a three year faster payback than putting solar on our house would achieve."
10,2016-06-01T18:26:46+00:00,qbrozen,Don't forget savings in oil changes. ;b
11,2016-06-01T20:29:03+00:00,fushigi,"..and brakes (regen braking reduced brake wear), no timing belt to replace, no engine air filters. All kinds of maintenance just goes away."
12,2016-06-01T22:11:59+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"True, but not ""all kinds""---I don't know about the Soul EV maintenance fees but the Tesla has ""checkups"" and they aren't cheap. I believe a rough estimate for Tesla maintenance is $600 a year. If you drive a lot, it could be more.

So really, not that much different from a gasoline car still in warranty.

I'll have t collar a Soul EV owner next time I can and ask about that."
13,2016-06-01T22:18:01+00:00,texases,"Low maintenance, yes, but Tesla reliability has been poor."
14,2016-06-02T00:59:08+00:00,fintail,"Saw a blue Model X today, maybe the same one as before. Hard to tell, this was also unplated, and the driver demographic around here look similar."
15,2016-06-02T02:15:53+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"New Subaru Outback, prettty light green metallic color. I used to joke ""Does Subaru even HAVE a styling department"" but this one looks pretty nice for a wagon."

And, of course , a herd of Model S and X at the Tesla store down the block. As always, the S is sharp; the X is bulbous."
20,2016-06-03T20:08:34+00:00,kyfdx,Saw my first F-Pace last night.... at a hoity-toity art museum fundraiser. In white. Very nice looking.
21,2016-06-04T06:04:03+00:00,fintail,"Maybe not brand new, but I spotted a new style Rolls Royce coupe this evening. It's big. and not quite like classic models (of which one could buy a few for the price of the new one)."
22,2016-06-05T01:14:58+00:00,fintail,"Spotted a Jag XE on the lot, had to stop and take a look. I sat in it, surprised that it felt as roomy as it did. Local lot has 2, a base car with a 36K sticker, and a loaded 56K car. Touchscreen-only nav irritated me - I want redundant controls or a knob/touchpad, as I am one of those people who will go insane from fingerprints. Also a couple F-Pace on the lot, one with something like 8K in mop 'n glo type add ons, that didn't give me a good vibe.

I looked at a 12 year old Maybach at the adjacent Bentley dealer, typical Continental assortment, but a 2009 Phantom coupe caught my eye, wearing its original window sticker of 509K."
23,2016-06-05T11:26:16+00:00,explorerx4,"Across the street, neighbor came home with a silvery blue Outback wagon."
24,2016-06-05T16:46:49+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Did you like the styling?
25,2016-06-05T17:05:28+00:00,explorerx4,"There are plenty of Outbacks around here. The styling has improved, not trying so hard to look rugged, and I like the size of them."
26,2016-06-05T21:10:55+00:00,fintail,"I see so many Outbacks, I might not even instantly recognize a new one. They blend in with the scenery in this part of the world.

Was out doing errands, stopped by the MB dealer. This is the doldrums time, not many cars on the lot, maybe more at the offsite lot. Just one or two of each model. A nearly zero option S-class might have been the most remarkable thing, that and a Cardinal Red E63 wagon."
27,2016-06-06T17:59:31+00:00,stever,"Saw two identical white Chevy Traverse LT's heading into the college campus this morning, both with dealer plates. Maybe there was an event happening."

the back end though, if kind of squished up."
48,2016-06-11T03:29:11+00:00,fintail,"It does have a presence to it. The prior one sold better than I expected, I suspect this one will too.

7,2016-06-23T21:14:14+00:00,Michaell,I don't think the HR-V is as popular as Honda had hoped. What is the best selling small (tiny?) ute? I'd guess the Buick Encore based on how many I see around here.
8,2016-06-23T21:31:24+00:00,texases,"I'm seeing some CX-3s, but I'd get the CX-5."
9,2016-06-23T21:42:14+00:00,stickguy,"I think a lot of people look at the HRV compared to the CRV, in terms of what you get and the cost, and deem the CRV to be a better deal."

Same with the Mazda, though I did see a CX-3 today and admired its looks.

I could live with a CX-3 FWD Touring."

That plan, obviously, has been scrapped."
16,2016-06-24T19:22:58+00:00,stickguy,"Lots of new stuff today. Stopped at the Buick dealer (was next door getting touch up paint for the Sonata) and sat in a Cascada (I liked it, and could even see out the windshield without looking at the header!). Small trunk, so would take creative luggage selection. Not bad for the MSRP (base car so 33K).

also sat in an Envision (the new mid size CUV). Pretty nice inside, comfy seats, and seemed to be about the same size and cargo room as our RDX (maybe a smidge bigger trunk). But was 46k sticker (premium II), and it didn't even have a moonroof. Considering everything on the sticker (engine/trans/body/assembly) said China, I don't think so. Nice looking design though.

then went to the Honda dealer. Sat in a Ridgeline. Much nicer looking than the old one. Seemed plenty big to me, without being huge and cumbersome. Could even see out of it OK. Roomy inside, back seat seemed fine but I did not play much. Black edition, MSRP 43k. I think these will sell well, if they start bringing in more mid-level models for less money."
17,2016-06-25T00:56:18+00:00,tjc78,"46k?? Wow our Enclave was 47 and change with Nav, Bose, Moonroof and pano roof over the second row. FWD, though."

Did you just use the word ""pleasant"" to describe the NJ Turnpike?

It's been years since I've had to drive it. Is it that much better?"
24,2016-06-25T13:25:26+00:00,stickguy,"yes, the improvement was amazing on the stretch between the Philly area and around the Garden state parkway exit. They eliminated around West Windsor where it dropped from 6 to 3 lanes, and used to back up for miles when busy. Plus the road is smooth, and various other improvements.

they basically extended the truck lanes all the way down, instead of bringing the 2 sections together."

26,2016-06-25T16:14:53+00:00,fintail,"Yesterday I dropped off the loaner I had while the dashcam was being moved to the new car. I got a ride there in a 2014 E63S, high option car, probably stickered at 110-115K or so. At 11K miles, they want 75K for it, and I know you could knock that down a bit. Cool car and sounds amazing, almost crashed it as the lot attendant guy/kid didn't look both ways when pulling out of a driveway. That would have been awkward.

My C300 loaner:



Or is it an E or an S? At some angles and distances, not easy. Definitely in the same sausage-different lengths ideal that BMW has used for a little while, and Audi has used for years.

I drove it under 20 miles, so I can't make a real impression, but it seemed OK. It wasn't loaded, but the seats are nice. Thigh support extensions, BMW has done it for ages, why did it take MB so long to get on board?"
27,2016-06-25T16:50:24+00:00,fintail,"I think that's an S on the back, GLC below it. Not something you see every day.

Doesn't look that nice in white but they have a dark green color which is really nice. Haven't had aa chance to drive one yet as we have none in our fleet. The couple of Encores I have driven have been very nice and are tuned softer than the Chevy Trax. Do see more Encore's then either HR-V's or Trax's for some reason. Am hoping that they add knobs to the infotainment systems on the HR-V EX and EX-L eventually when I am in the market again. I actually like a hatchback style just for the extra cargo area. The small size is just a bonus.

29,2016-06-26T03:16:00+00:00,stever,Met a woman tonight with a white HR-V. Loves it. Said the AC worked fine (that was an issue with our tester). Said it was the perfect size for her and that the CR-V was just a tad too big.
30,2016-06-26T03:23:59+00:00,stickguy,I found the HRV to be plenty roomy when I sat in it. Never drove one though.

Curious. All the reviews I have read have commented/complained about the lack or room or packaging issues inside."
32,2016-06-26T14:45:56+00:00,stever,"I wonder if you are thinking of, say, the CX-3?

""With the rear seats up on a front-drive HR-V, there are 24.3 cubic feet of luggage space available. Folding the seats flat opens 58.8 cubic feet, which is excellent for this class.""

That's similar to the Kia Soul (even better with the seats up):

""One of the benefits of the Soul's boxy design is an abundance of head- and legroom, even in the backseat. Behind the rear seatbacks you'll find 19 cubic feet of cargo room, which grows to 61 cubic feet with both sections of the 60/40-split rear seatbacks folded down. This is greater than compact hatchbacks and on par with some SUVs.""

The AC couldn't keep up on our test drive but the owner I met claimed hers was just fine. Other than the AC concerns, we liked it a lot on our short test drive."
35,2016-06-26T18:08:42+00:00,tjc78,As a whole the AC in the newer cars isn't that great IMO. I'm sure between the change from R12 and more efficient compressors that it will be that way going forward. They do the job but no where near the freezers of the 70s/80s and early 90s (I think 93 was the last year the EPA allowed R12).
36,2016-06-26T18:27:48+00:00,stever,"Dunno, we've tested quite a few in 90+ temps out here and that was the only one that didn't seem to keep up. The old van's AC does fine too. Then again I'm cold natured and the house feels chilly to me with the AC on 77°."
37,2016-06-26T19:02:15+00:00,tjc78,"Don't get me wrong, the last few cars we have had ""do the job"" but none get absolutely frigid like the old cars. My 04 MGM is pretty darn cold but I remember my 79 Continental would literally blow frost on a humid day. I also recall my moms 92 Caravan was also extremely cold (people in the third row used to say they were cold and it didn't have ducts back there).

I'd put the AC on 68 in the house if I thought it would keep up and I didn't want a $500 electric bill. 73/74 has to do."

Ha! That's funny and it reminds me of when I went on vacation with my parents when I was a kid. We would check into a motel that had A/C and I would always have it on full blast. Since it was fairly unique back then even in commercial buildings up here I was fascinated by it.

Years later me and 2 other guys went of a business trip to Florida in June 1988. Both heat and humidity were 90+ all the time we were there. All 3 of us had out hotel rooms set at 68 degrees. The local folks we were meeting with could not understand that. We could not understand why all the local guys we were meeting with were all wearing cotton undershirts in that heat until they explained to us it helped with the perspiration. It was news to us."

30,2016-08-01T01:15:12+00:00,stever,No wonder they all look alike.
31,2016-08-08T21:18:44+00:00,stickguy,"New Range Rover murano (er, Evoque) convertible. Odd duck."
32,2016-08-08T21:51:26+00:00,explorerx4,"@stickguy,
You reminded me, I saw one of the Evoque convertibles in Hamburg. Riding in it in all its' Orange glory were a pair of newlyweds."
33,2016-08-12T01:47:08+00:00,fintail,"Two new grille-less Teslas today, one even had a front plate."

35,2016-08-12T02:34:14+00:00,stever,Range Rover HSE with temp tags.
36,2016-08-12T02:43:43+00:00,stickguy,"hey, all are on my list to look at next year!"
37,2016-08-12T04:05:27+00:00,Michaell,"Anything with 4 wheels is on your list, stick."
38,2016-08-12T12:02:07+00:00,iluvmysephia1,Lists are good...sometimes.
39,2016-08-12T12:53:14+00:00,stickguy,"My wife's list, is a bit shorter. So key is, don't ask her."
40,2016-08-12T13:03:05+00:00,Michaell,"If it's your car, does she get to render an opinion?"
41,2016-08-12T14:15:02+00:00,stickguy,"An opinion, since it will also be our primary together car. Not final say, but if she really hated something, I wouldn't push it too far!"
42,2016-08-12T18:20:32+00:00,tjc78,"Wife and I just did an overnight in Baltimore and while driving down and back I was pointing out all the SUVs I want her to check out with me when we are ready for the next one. I suggested we go to the Philly car show and check them all out. She agreed, and then said that she will not go to dealers with me.

Saw a bunch of new Tahoes and Yukons. I can't believe how well they are selling. Seemed to be everywhere. Also saw two metallic brown Accord V6 Touring. Don't like the brown, but I really like the new style."
43,2016-08-15T12:37:17+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Spotted (2) new Q60 Coupes, very sharp.

Also visited the dealer this weekend to put a set off tires on my S2000 and they had a total of (1) Ridgline in stock (Black Sport). They are selling as soon as they get them and the rest are ordering them. I may actually make a move on that Sport if I can get over my OCD with owning black cars (my 2007 Impreza is black and it's been a challenge)."
44,2016-08-15T12:42:52+00:00,stickguy,I saw a ridge line in the wild this weekend. A white one. I really like them.
45,2016-08-15T19:38:37+00:00,qbrozen,"Also saw a Ridgeline, and also white. Not bad looking. Visually smaller than the original."
46,2016-08-15T19:58:42+00:00,explorerx4,also saw a new white Ridgeline today. Pretty blandtastic.
47,2016-08-15T20:14:12+00:00,kyfdx,"It's the front end that leaves me less than enthusiastic. If it had the front end from the previous generation Pilot, I could live with it."
48,2016-08-15T20:18:55+00:00,stickguy,"Looks nice and clean to me. Though I also think the FS trucks are all brutally overdone at this point, and front ends way to blocky and bulky (false machismo?)."
49,2016-08-15T21:26:25+00:00,qbrozen,I saw it first in profile from a distance. I thought Mitsu maybe made a new Raider.
0,2016-08-15T21:27:22+00:00,stickguy,the interior is just a tad nicer in the Honda.
1,2016-08-16T00:07:44+00:00,explorerx4,"Those FS trucks have big blocky front ends because they are designed to tow several times their weight and need lots of cooling.
I saw that one of the car magazines had to have the transmission in their long term Pilot replaced at just over 21k.
Not sure if the Ridgeline has the same one."
2,2016-08-16T01:07:14+00:00,ab348,Plus it makes them look macho.
3,2016-08-16T01:21:49+00:00,stickguy,"you said that with a straight face? Funny how a few generations ago, they had sloped front ends you could see over, and towed just fine.

the new look is all about trying to come across as Macho and tough, practicality be darned."
4,2016-08-16T06:03:25+00:00,tlong,"Well given that a high fraction of truck owners (and probably SUV owners as well) don't use their vehicles much for the optimized purposes, practicality IS darned. But it adds profits for the automakers..."
5,2016-08-17T00:54:53+00:00,fintail,"Saw what might be a Bellevue trifecta - white Model X, Stepford driver, no front plate. Also not new but amusing, saw three ""7"" Audis in a short span - normal A7, S7, RS7, in that order. The latter is the one."
6,2016-08-18T01:14:54+00:00,explorerx4,"Still looking at buying something new.
Stopped by a multi line dealer today that has Audi Ford Lexus and Porsche.
I was looking for a Ford.
On the remote lot, where most of the Fords are, I saw 4 Audi's up on bricks, with no wheels/tires.
An S5, A6 and 2 TT's. Guessing the TT's were performance models as they had quad exhaust pipes.
Lot of money gone there."
7,2016-08-18T02:35:51+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new E class on the road, I think my first not parked at the dealer - the side creases are more horizontal, which might be the best giveaway as it looks so much like a C from a distance. Also saw a guy getting into an i8, very awkward."
8,2016-08-18T13:49:18+00:00,texases,A new Caddy XTS...hearse:
9,2016-08-18T16:24:45+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I used to say ""I wouldn't be seen dead in a Cadillac"", but now.......?"
10,2016-08-18T17:03:15+00:00,tlong,I hope you don't catch me riding in that one any time soon...
11,2016-08-20T18:25:48+00:00,tjc78,I guess they have to make them out of something .... The newer cars just look really stupid as hearses. Town Car and Devilles looked so much better.
12,2016-08-21T02:06:33+00:00,berri,"Seems like a lot of hearses, like cop cars, are going the SUV route. I see many Suburban's in livery forms these days."
13,2016-08-21T14:18:08+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,FUVs?
14,2016-08-21T16:29:21+00:00,tjc78,They all should use Lincoln MKTs. They look like a hearse straight from the factory.
15,2016-08-21T16:55:51+00:00,fintail,Saw a Caddy XT6 on the road this morning.
16,2016-08-21T17:20:13+00:00,ab348,"No, it would have been either an XT5 (SUV) or CT6 (big sedan)."
17,2016-08-21T17:22:40+00:00,fintail,"Ha, this dopey alphanumeric scheme their one trick pony CEO brought over from Infiniti doesn't agree with my mind."
18,2016-08-21T17:38:47+00:00,berri,"I'm guessing that somewhere down the road we may see a return to actual vehicle names. The letters and numbers, at least to me. have really become meaningless in most cases, if not sometimes confusing."
19,2016-08-21T18:22:21+00:00,stickguy,I saw a burgundy XT5 on the apron outside the caddy dealer. Nice looking. Sharper than the SRX it replaced.
20,2016-08-21T18:38:12+00:00,Michaell,"For domestic makes, maybe.

Doubtful we'll see the Germans or the luxury Japanese brands do this, however. Too much cachet in the brand name, not the model name."
21,2016-08-21T18:44:06+00:00,stickguy,"at least the Germans have distinct model naming that helps (the engine/trim, that is off the rails.)

easy to know how to compare a 3/5/7 series. Or a C/E/S class..And X or Q signifies the SUV version.

IMO, does not work the other way, when everything starts with say XT like Lincoln, and there is no apparent logic or consistency to the rest of the name.

and names can be just as bad, unless they are clearly established, and don't change (civic/accord, Malibu/Impala). coming out with new names frequently is just as bad, though maybe easier to learn.

I guess it really is Caddy and Lincoln that are causing the problems."
22,2016-08-21T19:41:20+00:00,stever,Not for some of us.
23,2016-08-21T19:48:36+00:00,fintail,"For the Germans, the engine-related number has become less accurate over time, but the model identifier remains easy to remember. C/E/S, 3/5/7, A4/A6/A8, etc. It's intuitive. MB actually made things a little easier for the CUV/SUV line, by linking them up to their relative position compared to cars (GLA/GLC/GLE etc).

Names changing over time ended up being an issue for domestics. In 1957, a Bel Air was the top model, in 1959 a Galaxie was the top model, and so on. By 1970, both of those were not the top model. Bumping a name down in rank doesn't help with equity. The same braintrust who brought the weird structure to Infiniti has brought it to Caddy."
24,2016-08-21T21:24:57+00:00,kyfdx,"Then, you have Infiniti, where everything starts with a Q.

Why not just leave the Q off?"
25,2016-08-21T21:26:05+00:00,stever,Good Q.
26,2016-08-21T22:59:12+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Played with a new gadget in a 2016 Ford F150 4X4 today, called ""Trailer Assist"".

Basically, you put the car in reverse, press this thingie/button, and the truck goes into high idle speed, and a camera shows you a top view of your trailer on the dash screen. Then you use the rotating thingie/button to actually steer the trailer as the truck moves backwards. ""It"" knows the type of trailer and all the important dimensions because you plug those in beforehand for your particular trailer (tongue length, width, etc).

I'm pretty good backing up trailers already but for some folks who haven't practiced--they really suck at it."
27,2016-08-21T23:10:07+00:00,Michaell,"I'd be a perfect candidate for that technology. Not that I've driven much while towing a trailer, but the whole ""opposite"" thing just confuses me."
28,2016-08-21T23:38:25+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I learned how to do it in the Army---even in the dark! It's tricky if you pick the wrong type of trailer for your truck. You can get impossibly fast reactions from the trailer, making corrections difficult."
29,2016-08-21T23:45:41+00:00,stever,"I had a utility trailer I used with my '74 Jeep CJ-5. Should have renamed myself Jack Knife. I learned the hand on the bottom of the steering wheel trick but what I mostly learned was that any idiot can buy a trailer and immediately hit the Interstate and toddle along at 70 mph with no clue.

Over the years, one friend jack-knifed his camper on a freeway bridge blocking the two northbound lanes, two friends dropped their jet boats off their trailers in the middle of busy intersections and another guy had his utility trailer pass him and wind up in a field a half mile ahead of him.

Should be a towing endorsement required on the driver's license for those who pull trailers. Check the safety chains when you see trailers in parking lots - rarely will you see them property hooked up.

And if you see someone toting firewood with a homemade trailer made from a pickup bed, yikes!"
30,2016-08-21T23:59:40+00:00,fintail,"Saw an XT5 (is that right?) today.

There should be endorsements for many types of vehicles. As it stands today, I can use the same license to drive a Smart or a 42' behemoth motorhome or a 1000hp Veyron or a relatively large rented box truck, but I need an endorsement for a 250cc Vespa. Someone bought their laws."
31,2016-08-22T00:17:14+00:00,ab348,"While at the car show yesterday and just sitting by our cars for a while, we saw on the nearby road - a heavily traveled 2-lane country road - some (presumed) tourists with a big diesel interstate coach-style motorhome towing a large enclosed cargo trailer - probably a 20-footer. Didn't look like driving that would be a whole lot of fun. Normally you see those things pulling cars on a dolly, but I guess these folks drove around hauling all their worldly goods, unless there was a Smart car in there."
32,2016-08-22T00:29:06+00:00,stickguy,"I used to drive the equipment truck for my son's HS marching band, and would pick it up at the rental place (Ryder). Literally all you needed was a DL and a CC, and to be 18, and they would hand you the keys to a truck. I used to get a 26' box diesel Freightliner or International. Eye to eye with the semi drivers!

Let's just say, the instructions were minimal. Mostly where the key went, and how to put it in gear. And off you go.

man, they were so much fun to drive. Just not on tight city streets."
33,2016-08-22T01:54:37+00:00,berri,"Hey good buddy, got you a parking spot in the truck lot at tollway oasis and diners. That's a big 10-4"
34,2016-08-23T00:49:29+00:00,fintail,"Today saw 2x Model X, facelift Model S, and a facelift A4."
35,2016-08-23T19:38:05+00:00,anythngbutgm,Ouch.
36,2016-08-23T19:42:48+00:00,anythngbutgm,"2 Model X, one white and one red (the red looked pretty sharp with the slate gray wheels) and a which Volvo S90. All in Boston last evening."
37,2016-08-24T00:58:50+00:00,fintail,"Today's sightings: white W213 E-class, white hockey stick 7er."
38,2016-08-25T01:41:26+00:00,fintail,Today saw an Aventador and a not exactly perfectly driven Model X.
39,2016-08-26T23:20:18+00:00,explorerx4,"In the parking lot at work, lots of average stuff.
3 Rav4's, Honda minivan, Ford Explorer, Lexus ES350."
40,2016-08-27T00:55:29+00:00,fintail,"Saw a McLaren XYZ123 or whatever a new one is called, along with a couple of late model Ferraris. Kind of played out here - the BMW C650 maxi scooter I saw in traffic caught my eye more."
41,2016-08-27T23:04:03+00:00,tifighter,"Fiata. Brown. I loved the original 124, but I'm not feeling it."
42,2016-08-27T23:07:19+00:00,stickguy,Fiata. Like it. Reminds me of the old Saabaru.
43,2016-08-28T17:11:50+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Not sure I like that double grille.
44,2016-08-28T20:31:07+00:00,tjc78,I once drove one of those with my left hand (I'm left handed) in a cast from KOP to Baltimore and back... That stunk to say the least.
45,2016-08-30T00:52:48+00:00,fintail,"Saw a white Pacifica (rental) on the road, and a C63 AMG."
46,2016-08-30T01:44:23+00:00,berri,"I always felt that white shows up design flaws, so I gotta ask your opinion on what you though about its looks (yeah, I know its just a minivan, but it is all new, so I'm curious)"
47,2016-08-30T03:20:59+00:00,fintail,"I don't mind it. It looks very European to me, something reminds me of Renault design. It also seems bigger in person than in pics. White is an inoffensive color when not trying to be trendy/"
48,2016-08-30T15:58:52+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"White makes cars look larger, so if the styling is a bit porky to begin with, that color will accentuate that IMO."
49,2016-08-31T01:38:22+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Model X with a front plate, they exist!"
0,2016-08-31T01:52:06+00:00,stickguy,"is that the weird wagon thing with rear butterfly doors? I saw one of those last weekend, getting dried off outside a carwash. had the back doors up."
1,2016-08-31T01:53:57+00:00,fintail,"Yep. I still have yet to see one in public with the doors open, but I see them on the road almost every day."
2,2016-08-31T02:11:32+00:00,qbrozen,The model X or a front plate?
3,2016-08-31T03:07:28+00:00,fintail,The front plate. Front plate use among Tesla drivers here is low. The model X or a front plate?
4,2016-08-31T04:20:12+00:00,tifighter,"Darth Hellcat. Challenger. Full blackout. That's one way to spend $70k, I suppose."
5,2016-09-02T01:14:41+00:00,fintail,Today saw a laughably poorly driven newish A8 and a couple of front overhang Lexus RX on a transport truck.
6,2016-09-03T10:06:52+00:00,tjc78,"White over beige Cascada, top down. Wife said ""what was that?"" I told her new Buick convertible. She said, ""wow what a chick car"" lol."
7,2016-09-03T11:47:52+00:00,qbrozen,Sighted a Buick Envision yesterday. Nothing terribly thrilling. Just seems to finally be a right-sized Buick SUV.
8,2016-09-03T16:08:44+00:00,stever,"Our realtor has one and it looks nice; white too, think the inside is black though. I bet she'll never put the top down, although she claims she's had it down a couple of times.

When the arroyos washed out in our area the other day, she had to get a ride home - between the 19"" rubber band tires and the low clearance, she would have been clunking a lot of rocks in several spots (they get front end loaders out here after a big dump of rain to clear the ""boulders"" off the roads."
9,2016-09-03T18:25:41+00:00,tlong,"Within 2 minutes of each other:
A lady in a black Q50, in the fast lane in stop and go traffic, paying more attention to her phone than the road.
A Toyota Mirai fuel cell vehicle. I'm sure limited production volumes on that one.
A new Prius

In general, Toyota's styling has gone exceptionally bizarre and not in a good way. In fact the Corolla and Camry seem to be their only normal looking vehicles. The Prius tailights and ""wing"" are hideous. I also think the taillights on the new Civic are atrocious. For me, Mazda's vehicles are the best looking of the Japanese crowd."
10,2016-09-03T22:49:32+00:00,berri,"Don't worry, the Camry is supposed to get a big restyle for 17. Just imagine how fugly that will probably be - perhaps a Japanese horror anime!"
11,2016-09-04T01:25:17+00:00,tjc78,"Lets be honest, there really hasn't been a good looking Camry since the 92-96."
12,2016-09-04T03:39:01+00:00,berri,"Heck, I'm not sure there was ever a really good looking Camry, but hose older ones lasted and lasted. In fact, you'd see the vintage you mentioned in station wagons as taxi's at Reagan National Airport for many years afterwards. Those and RWD Buick Roadmasters."

Of late I've been partial to Sonic's Cherry Lime-Aid."
19,2016-09-08T13:52:19+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Bentley Bentayga out this morning. From a distance I thought it was an X5, but as I approached, I noticed it was maybe slightly bigger and insanely more expensive. Somewhat erratically driven, as expected from a car of that stature in this part of the world. No doubt a nice reward for laundering money in real estate or working to get that sketchy factory open in a distant land or other bootstrappy pursuits"
20,2016-09-08T15:29:11+00:00,kyfdx,I'm partial to orange at Steak 'n Shake.

Most were in grey or black, but they had a few Lime Freeze models there. Color didn't seem quite as retina-searing as the shade in the photo. Still not great though."
22,2016-09-08T23:17:39+00:00,qbrozen,"Spent some time at a traffic light today behind a new civic sedan in dark grey with the lip spoiler. Man, that thing is ugly from the rear. I could not even begin to count the number of angles and surfaces."
23,2016-09-09T01:34:34+00:00,texases,So many makes are hard to look at now...
24,2016-09-09T01:53:31+00:00,berri,"It's the generation of Anime in car styling, or otherwise Lego friendly"
25,2016-09-09T02:13:03+00:00,stickguy,the Civic is starting to grow on me. But is one of those cars that really needs to be in certain colors.
26,2016-09-09T05:13:47+00:00,tlong,I agree; Honda's never been great at styling but they've jumped the shark with the new Civic. Only surpassed by the new Prius. So we're in the era of hideous angled taillights...a look that IMHO won't age well at all.
27,2016-09-09T05:33:31+00:00,Michaell,"The more I look at the new Civic, the less I like it.

For some reason, I'm really digging the classic lines of my new Jetta sedan. Simple, with plenty of headroom and good sightlines. Even better than the Elantra GT I just got rid of.

I fear that in 3 years when my lease is up, my choices for something similar will be even more limited."
28,2016-09-11T21:06:29+00:00,fintail,"Saw another Bentayga today, or maybe the same one, I don't know/care. That thing screams ""dirty money"" at least twice as loud as a G-Wagen."
29,2016-09-11T21:57:21+00:00,qbrozen,"Oddly enough, I saw not 1 but 2 Slingshots this weekend. A red and a black. I wonder if a helmet is required with that. It is classified as a motorcycle, after all, right? Guy in the black one had no helmet."

So, I would imagine that the helmet requirement would be based on the state you live in.

I checked randomly and most states seem to classify it as a motorcycle. Then I went to Nevada, the ""do whatever you want state"", and sure enough, it's not a motorcycle anymore."

0,2016-09-16T15:44:44+00:00,texases,"More BMW number magic - the '30i' is for the turbo 4 2.0 liter engine, replacing the '28i' designation. This to combat MB's C300 with a similar engine."

3,2016-09-16T15:50:53+00:00,texases,"For example, last year's 228i is this year's 230i, both with the same 2.0 liter turbo 4. It's a change for marketing reasons."
4,2016-09-16T16:15:45+00:00,qbrozen,"They USED to signify the displacement of the engine under the hood. A 325i has a 2.5 liter engine, etc."
5,2016-09-16T16:19:18+00:00,texases,"But even in the pre-turbo era BMW played number games. At one point the '325i' had a 2.8 '323i' had a 2.5 l NA 6 engine, but they wanted to separate it from the '330i'.

edited- @qbrozen has it right, it was the 2.5l engine. And yes, this was minor, compared to the turbo-induced major number games now being played by BMW and MB."
6,2016-09-16T17:26:56+00:00,qbrozen,But I don't believe that really started until the e90 era. The one exception I recall was the e46 323 with the 2.5. And I think some of the 318 models were a bit scattered.

Belongs to company who flew to Dallas to pick it up - it's going to supplement her 1990 Mazda B2600 with 240,000 miles on it. The salesperson quit so the order got cancelled back in the Spring and then the dealership got sold over the summer and when she finally tracked them down for a status report, the truck had just come in. Luckily they hadn't sold it out from under her. No hurry to buy it, it's not like the Mazda was ever going to die. She drove it up to Alaska and back this summer.

She didn't have a good reason to buy it in Dallas other than the fact that she wanted to visit friends there and then drive home to Arizona via our place and catch up with us.

Didn't order any extras other than a towing package, but she's amazed by the intermittent wipers, the backup cam and especially loves the cruise control."

I liked that about it and the overall exterior look, but was very disappointed by the dashboard design and controls though. The dash design is just kind of clunky looking, and the steering wheel buttons are covered with a rubbery membrane and so are not distinct buttons on the surface.

This Chief Designer hired away from Audi Motors, Peter Schreyer, is really designing these South Korean cars ""German"" these days, ain't he? This one has caught my eye, indeed. A few engine sizes available, including a 1.0L 4-cyl turbo. I would consider the turbo or the 1.4L 4-cyl motor. Upper-end 2018 Rio packages will offer a 6-speed or DSG tranny and lower-end (me) offer 5-speed manuals and I would say an automatic without DSG transmission. The car will do the ""coming out early in 2017 as a 2018 model"" confusatory thing. Mitsubishi did this with my beloved 2008 Lancer GTS - it became available for sale in March of 2007.



Pricing will be critical. Our '11 Soul base 5-speed has only a little over 73,500 miles on it now. That red always gets me. The Soul looks great in Tomato Red, too."

The day we traded the hulk of our '08 Mitsubishi Lancer GTS for the Soul I sat in a '11 Rio sedan. Small - intruding cabin area. I didn't see a 5-dr. hatch Rio on their lot to try out. Sat in a '14 Kia Soul and it felt comfortable. The length is increasing on the '18 Rio and I'll check the width - betcha they've upped it, too. Ahh...happiness.

Love ta see what, if anything Toyota does to their newly-acquired Scion iA. Probably just plopping a shiny Toyota badge on that odd-looking, great driving new small car. Still like it - but not like I am starting ta like the '18 Kia Rio.

Saw a couple of revised MDX's, nice to see they brought back the exhaust tips.

New RAV4 seems more popular than the new CR-V around here. Lotsa the new ones with the LED headlights, it's actually one of Toyotas more handsome styling exercises IMO...

Not so common sightings included an killer F-Type R Coupe, a Red AMG GT, a 650i Grandsport, a couple of Maserati Guilia's (SP?), a smattering of Model X's (I dig the looks), couple f Continental GT's (one HT, one vert)."

Rear leg room in the Versa S sedan

fintail - did ya see any of these on the East Coast? As much as conventional wisdom tells me ta buy a 2017 Kia Soul base white in 6-speeds, this little pup from Nissan just keeps talkin' at me from the other shoulder. Left shoulder=from the dark forces? Or does the tempting one work from the right shoulder? Selling at Fenton Nissan just a few Griffey throws to our north in Tiffany Springs, MO. Look at the room in back! Read from someone with a stick Versa that he laid some rubber down in 2nd gear in his. The Fenton Price, you want ta know? $12,139.

They have neatly tidied up the rear end on the Versa sedan such that I am buying it now. The look, not the car. At least for now. They tie it all together with the very lower line of the bonnet...it looks as if you're looking at the side view of the gas tank or something black down there. Anyhow, it flows nicely to me - there's no part of the body design that nags at me like a leaky faucet at all. Nice job, Nissan body designers. I like the Sentra, tolerate the new world order Maxima, but this one is my favorite.

Don't think I'll go rogue and try a trade-in on the quick, but Nissan has priced this sedan at such a bargain-basement price that the Kia Soul at $4,000 more is...making me broil butterflies in my tummy again.

""Get in my belly!"" ~ Fat $%^&*()%"

Agreed, imidazol97. And what the metallic blue 2016 Nissan Versa SL sedan did was draw me to look closer at it. The person who owns it backed it in to the office area parking of the Russelville, AR, Motel 6. I immediately detected someone who loves their small Nissan sedan like I would love mine if I were to pull the trigger on one of my own. I like them in Gun Metal grey and Fresh Powder white the most. Nissan won't sell a Versa S in metallic red or blue - you've got to pay more for a better-outfitted Versa in order to get the more ""premium"" colors.

Incidentally - Chevy's new Cruze in both sedan and hatchback forms are really looking attractive to me. Even the Chevy Spark looks better minus the alien-reptile drawn back headlights from the original Spark. Even so, I've noticed that the original Chevy Spark owners love their Spark's!"

I always thought it was a nice looking car, but boy it's not impressive to drive IMHO.
Interior is a sea of black (don't like all black interiors.
An ergonomic disaster. Driver door so far open when getting in that you have to reach waaaay out to grab the handle. Not sure how any ladies could manage this.
Rear view mirror so low that I had to adjust the seat waaay down to even see out the center of the windshield. And then I'm looking over the window sills like I'm in a bathtub.
Climate control is a mess. Buttons for fan speed and some controls (AC), but need to touch on screen multiple presses to bring up temperature control.
Mute the radio and it's back on again when you come back into the car.
Electronic gearshift on center console. What does the pushing the button do? Too afraid to try that while driving. Hopefully that can't happen accidentally.
I can see why it doesn't sell well."

I am at least modestly tall with some reach. Can't imagine how fun this would be for someone who is 5'5"". I'd grab part of the door panel, rather than a handle or armrest.

You should have tried the gear button - that's what rentals are for

200 is an odd thing - it's a pretty impressive budget reskin, but it becomes obvious most of the work was done on the outside. Good excuse to book a higher rental class"

I dunno---1/4 million dollar SUVs playing with Jeeps at Moab and driven by journalists who will never own one---it all borders on self-parody."
30,2016-12-13T20:41:00+00:00,fintail,"The idea of of a Bentayga in real world off road use is like the idea of a Bentayga owner being self made and completely ethical and above board.

Saw a Model S 90D in the workplace garage, I so want to replace the Tesla badging (which is in such a dull font, reminds me of a 90s Buick) with an old MB ""190D"" badge."
31,2016-12-13T22:07:05+00:00,stever,"2017 RAV4 Hybrid, just purchased by a weaving friend. They had trouble getting the color they wanted - wound up paying ""a lot"" for a white one that does not have a black interior."

33,2016-12-13T23:24:36+00:00,stever,"lol, different kind of weaving. Lunch did include some ""NM hot chili"" squash casserole. I'm starting to develop a taste for that kind of sauce."
34,2016-12-14T12:46:07+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Mercedes GLC has become quite popular in the Boston area. I counted more than a dozen of them on my way home from there yesterday afternoon. At first it comes off kind of bland and generic but once you really look at the details, it is quite stylish. I quite like it myself.

Saw a couple of new S90's as well. A very handsome sedan IMO..."
35,2016-12-14T14:33:24+00:00,ab348,"Saw something interesting the other day, one of the new Volvo SUVs, I believe a XC90. It was just getting dark out and the driver came to an offset intersection. At first he steered slightly to the right and I saw a light appear on the right. Then he steered left and it went out and a cornering light of sorts came on ahead of the front wheel on the left. He used no turn signals on either side. It seemed like it has cornering lights that are switched by inputs to the steering wheel. Never saw that before, interesting."
36,2016-12-14T14:39:29+00:00,fintail,"Sounds like a BMW to me

The new XC is everywhere here now. Co-worker who has some dough recently got a top of the line high spec hybrid one. I have yet to see an ""Excellence"", as for 100K+, I'd take a Range Rover or a mafioso G-Wagen. Volvo is ambitious for sure."
37,2016-12-14T17:11:30+00:00,Michaell,My wife's Outback has cornering lights triggered by the steering wheel.
38,2016-12-14T17:29:20+00:00,ab348,"That is a cool thing. I love cornering lights and they are on too few vehicles. My old '79 Park Avenue had them and they seemed almost as bright as a headlight, which was great. My Intrigue had them too but they were not nearly as bright, really not very useful to the driver. I don't think I've had them on any car since. Unfortunate."
39,2016-12-14T17:37:25+00:00,fintail,"The full LED lights on my E also have a cornering function, I notice it when I am in a garage etc, it puts out extra light sideways when the wheel is turned beyond a certain angle. Not sure of the practical use of it, but it's interesting."
40,2016-12-14T18:08:33+00:00,stever,"I had cornering lights in my Quest that were triggered by the turn signals. Mine weren't that bright either @ab348, can't say I miss them."
41,2016-12-14T18:12:05+00:00,tjc78,"Miss the cornering lights from my 04 Grand Marquis, they were triggered by the turn signals. I didn't know about the steering wheel trigger. It only makes sense, all cars now have a steering angle sensor for stability control, so they just use that output."
42,2016-12-14T18:41:20+00:00,qbrozen,"I do have to say that I miss them. The CTS had adaptive headlights or whatever they are, that turned with the wheel. I live in such a rural area with no streetlights nor ambient light. I did not realize how much difference they made until now that I no longer have them."
43,2016-12-14T19:38:03+00:00,tjc78,"I think we just had the headlight discussion over in CCBA, but yes Xenons that swivel are fantastic. Our Enclave just has regular Xenon and I do notice a difference from the LaCrosse that swiveled."
44,2016-12-14T21:00:29+00:00,explorerx4,"My wife's MKC definitely has corner in lights active by turning the wheel.
Back in '83 my Tbird had them too, but I think they were activated by the turn signals."
45,2016-12-14T21:36:37+00:00,fintail,I think my mom's 93 Taurus had the turn signal ones - some Ford in the family had them.
46,2016-12-14T23:57:36+00:00,tjc78,"Alot of upper trim Fords in the 80s had them. All my Panthers did, heck my 79 Town Coupe had them too."
47,2016-12-15T03:35:29+00:00,fintail,"Now that I think of it, my uncle's 91 Taurus had them, I remember them clearly."
48,2016-12-15T04:27:01+00:00,kyfdx,Early and mid '70s Lincolns and Cadillacs both had them.
49,2016-12-15T18:39:02+00:00,fintail,Saw a VW Allroad (as I call it) this morning.
0,2016-12-15T20:42:19+00:00,fintail,"New Civic hatch - are those faux air intakes on the back of the rear bumper? If the volume of styling is a good thing, we have a car for you."
1,2016-12-15T21:18:02+00:00,stickguy,"well, on the back, I assume they are faux air exhausts. But yes, I think they are decorative pieces meant to mimic that."
2,2016-12-15T21:24:35+00:00,fintail,"Awfully big for exhausts - I bet some could be told to believe they are for brake cooling or something . But there's a lot of exaggeration overall, and that does seem to be a theme these days."
3,2016-12-15T21:50:38+00:00,Michaell,"I saw a new Civic today ... couldn't really tell if it was a sedan or hatch.

The more I look at it, the more I don't like the styling.

Right up there with the new Prius.

God forbid this is the direction Honda is going ... new Accord is due out next year. Wonder if it will be similar."
4,2016-12-15T22:11:19+00:00,ab348,The Civic hatch is absolutely hideous in terms of styling. Far worse than the Civic sedan which itself is no prize. It rivals the Aztek in terms of delivering pain to the eyes.
5,2016-12-15T22:48:24+00:00,stickguy,"yeah, I overall like the civic, but agree that it is a bit overdone, for effect I guess. hopefully they tame it a bit mid model run. I would guess the Accord is going to be less flashy, considering the different mission. The new CRV looks good, so that is a hopeful sign."
6,2016-12-16T00:23:38+00:00,stever,"Seriously? I drove one last month or so ago and I'm hard pressed to remember much about what it looked like. Mostly I remember that the passenger seat was disappointingly less than comfy, especially compared to the driver's seat."
7,2016-12-16T03:43:36+00:00,berri,I think some of these new Japanese designs are a throwback to Japan's early years here - lots of bric-a-brac tacked on
8,2016-12-16T06:31:11+00:00,Michaell,"Every time I look at my new Jetta in the driveway, I appreciate the 'classic' lines.

Some say 'boring', I say 'traditional'."
9,2016-12-16T13:26:25+00:00,tjc78,"I agree, Lexus seems to be the leader IMO."
10,2016-12-16T14:13:33+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I think some car mags used to call that early school of Japanese design ""Atomic Insect"""
11,2016-12-16T14:31:48+00:00,fintail,"Toyolex is definitely into the insectoid school of design. I think Lemko used to mock it pretty nicely.

The Asian makes are either emulating Japan ca. 1974 or Detroit ca. 1958."
12,2016-12-16T15:07:13+00:00,stever,"Same kind of arguments happen in the manga and anime worlds - some funny comparisons of updated children's stories are around.

The older stuff is traditional and conservative now, but at the time, it was odd ball.

Seems to me that all the cars that are drawn in manga are mostly just copies of existing iron."
13,2016-12-16T15:10:29+00:00,fintail,"Manga/anime is definitely an influence in some of this ""design"", IMO. I can't imagine the predator-and-Nike Lexus being seen as conservative - I'd hate to see what was considered flamboyant in that world."

19,2016-12-17T22:41:20+00:00,tlong,Honda is trying way too hard.
20,2016-12-17T22:43:18+00:00,tlong,I still say almost all of Mazda's current vehicles are really well styled. They are an exception.
21,2016-12-17T23:13:11+00:00,tlong,BTW what happened to Lemko? I miss his posts.
22,2016-12-17T23:52:21+00:00,fintail,"Do you still have the old TL? That is probably the high water mark of Acura design, with the old Legends being right up there too. For Honda, they were really on it around 25 years ago - 90-93 Accord is excellent, 94-97 wasn't bad, 92-95 Civic is good, 88-91 wasn't bad, Preludes from 92 til the end are good and the 88-91s aren't bad. It got too big after those models, then too busy.

Mazda isn't bad, no - relatively clean design. Nice contrast to Toyota.

I swear Lemko posted on a vintage car thread no more than a week or two ago, but he's been really scarce for a long time."
23,2016-12-17T23:54:50+00:00,fintail,"Stopped by the MB dealer today while out cruising in the old car (people at the dealership are amused when they see the old thing). There was a brown C300 on the floor - not too loaded, really unusual color. A C300 cabrio too, Designo, pearly white with a dark red interior, 61K sticker - seemed pretty nice and I have to imagine some are selling. Normal stuff on the floor, C-coupe, S63 coupe at 180K, a few SUVs, very little on the lot. Talked to the salesman who sold me the E, he says no new diesels have any kind of date yet, if they come at all."
24,2016-12-18T00:11:18+00:00,tlong,"I sold the old TL earlier in the year to a friend. It was an '05 and had 155K on it. It was a great car and I agree probably the best looking Acura design ever. I've seen the TLX in the showroom and although modernized a bit, for 10 years newer it really looks an awful lot like my old TL, I don't want to buy the same thing again.

We also had a 92 Accord and yes - that was also a great car. Hondas had a somewhat bland but handsome and clean style in those days - which is why I find their current designs looking so bad.

I'm currently driving my daughter's '07 Mazda 5 and am considering a fully loaded 3, or perhaps the refreshed CX-5 in six months or so. I'm partial to Mazda at this point, don't like Honda's directions and Toyota is too boring. Also kind of burned out on European acquisition and repair costs - although I love some of those cars strictly from a dynamics and looks perspective. But although I could afford it, I can't really justify spending over $40K for a car. I'd rather put my money elsewhere."
25,2016-12-18T02:48:39+00:00,fintail,"Mazda 5, that has to be a bit of a change of pace. I have a good friend who bought a 2 year old Mazda 6 several years ago - the relatively rare 5-door model. He still has it - but his wife likes it, so he is relegated to driving an Odyssey. Married with kids, he doesn't seem to care. His old Monte Carlo SS is still off the road waiting for the tomorrow that I hope becomes reality.

Cool cars don't have to cost a fortune, but you generally gotta pay to play. Your daughter might have said ""YOLO"" a few years ago - these are the good old days, and we probably only get one trip"
26,2016-12-18T04:54:29+00:00,stever,Another RAV4 with temp tags today. Again in white.
27,2016-12-18T14:11:42+00:00,tjc78,"They sell like crazy and good lease deals. My mother is in love with her 17. I get it, comfortable, quiet and 4wd. I just don't like the styling.

A friend at work buys them for his wife too. Loaded to the gills with a low 4s lease payment. So many better choices for that cash IMO. My moms was a little over 30 for 300 month."
28,2016-12-18T15:37:10+00:00,stever,"Yeah, they flopped up on my radar after a rash of new posters here started asking for pricing info about three months ago. Haven't really seen any great deals on them and they are a bit pricey. Didn't realize the demand was so high on them, figured they would have fallen off a bit when the V6 went away."

31,2016-12-18T21:46:57+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I know on some cars (Prius, e.g.) if one or a few of those led tail light bulbs go out, you don't replace the bulbs, you replace the entire array."

33,2016-12-18T23:22:42+00:00,fintail,"I like some of the less flamboyant LED tubular light designs. Some MB tail light designs look like wings, kind of cool.

If the turn signal portion of an Audi or BMW light assembly goes out, it doesn't matter, as it was never used anyway"
34,2016-12-20T14:05:29+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Spotted a truckload of new CR-V's on my ride home yesterday. It looks really good in person as well, with one exception. The wheel design is ugly IMO even tho the width is good. Overall, the vehicle has a really nice stance this time around, not so ""car on stilts"" like the previous generations."

I didn't even get a T shirt."

37,2016-12-23T23:46:53+00:00,explorerx4,I saw a new Lacrosse today. Seems quite a bit bigger than the previous couple of iterations.
38,2016-12-24T05:50:02+00:00,tlong,Black MB S550. Looked sleek and expensive.
39,2016-12-24T19:57:15+00:00,explorerx4,Saw this in the airport last night(not a great picture). MSRP 76+
40,2016-12-27T18:46:57+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Volvo S60 Cross Country this morning - never noticed one before. You can really see the increased ride height, reminds me of the 2000s era Outback sedans."

42,2016-12-28T14:04:20+00:00,stickguy,Valenti is where my son bought his Audi a few weeks ago. Should have held out for this.
43,2016-12-29T01:11:17+00:00,tifighter,I think I saw more XC60's today than was actually possible. They were everywhere. Bork bork bork!
44,2016-12-29T03:21:39+00:00,stickguy,"I saw a few today out on the NYS thruway. One was the ultimate Volvo. Vermont plates, and skis on the roof rack.

I really like these. If I had the money to get something in this class, would not mind at all doing a Sweden delivery on one."

49,2016-12-29T15:36:16+00:00,stickguy,"my son test drove a new S60 last month. I rode along. Was extremely impressed by what they have done with it for 2017. If I was looking now, it would be on the short list, assuming a screaming good lease deal was on the table!"
0,2016-12-29T18:31:06+00:00,berri,I think Volvo is a very different car than back in the 60's and early 70's. It is kind of interesting that a Scandinavian car is rwd. Maybe shows that tires and driving skill count more than fwd in snow.
1,2016-12-29T18:43:09+00:00,stickguy,"an old volvo 140, with skinny snow tires and chains, was damned near unstoppable in snow. Throw a few sandbags in the trunk for extra traction."
2,2016-12-29T18:52:38+00:00,berri,That's an interesting point about skinny tires. I think fwd got it's reputation for snow because that was the layout on the early Japanese cars and most had skinny tires if I recall.
3,2016-12-29T19:11:34+00:00,stickguy,"plus weight over the tires. Though I always thought RWD was better because of weight transfer when going uphill.

VW bugs were great for the same reason. Skinny little tires to cut through the snow, and all the weight hanging out over the rear.

Fat tires just become toboggans. You want skinny to cut through the snow."
4,2016-12-30T02:38:33+00:00,fintail,"Not all new, but I saw an Acura RLX today, sales volume must be at least 20 now."

7,2016-12-30T21:45:32+00:00,qbrozen,"Saw a new Civic hatch with temp tag about 30 mins ago. Slightly better rear than the sedan, but still fugly."
8,2016-12-30T22:14:18+00:00,Michaell,"At the Audi dealer yesterday, there was a matte grey RS7. Looked like something for the US Navy. Not at $125k"
9,2016-12-30T22:57:05+00:00,kyfdx,"Same at my local Audi dealer, when I did the buyback on Wednesday. This one was $133K.

I happen to love that color. It looks like unfinished plastic."

13,2017-01-02T18:46:45+00:00,fintail,"Not brand new, but amusing: saw a Camry with a fake fake convertible top. Not a normal fake convertible top, but an imitation of that. It was a few years old, dark red, chrome trim at the top of the A-pillar and base of the C-pillar, as usual for the faux cabrio look. But instead of having a cloth or vinyl top, it was just painted matte black. Stylin! Apparently someone moved from FL or NJ"

15,2017-01-02T19:44:10+00:00,imidazol97,Is that an urban trend to just paint the roof and add ornamentation? I've noted a few cars here in the metro with ornamentation added using chrome strips.

17,2017-01-02T23:21:13+00:00,ab348,But was it grounded to the ground?

I think it is kind of an urban thing if on a Crown Vic or Caddy or something, maybe not so much on a Camry in suburban Seattle. And I think the urban style people would demand an actual vinyl or cloth top, not just paint - never seen it like that before."
19,2017-01-03T01:43:49+00:00,fintail,"This afternoon I went and looked at a leftover 535d with a friend today, as he is curious about diesel. Not too loaded, 62K sticker. I suspect he could have got a significant amount off MSRP, but he wasn't thrilled by it. Oddly optioned - it had the virtual gauges and HUD etc, but base seats and wheels, and I think base lighting. BMW dealer had some fancy stuff on site - a couple of i8s, couple M6s (one I think had a sticker of like 175K), a few new 7ers. The salesman told my friend to hold out for the upcoming new 5er this spring - but I doubt he will go for it. He really likes the Jag XE."

22,2017-01-03T14:27:08+00:00,fintail,"XE looks like a nice package, but with desired options (my friend wants them all), it seems no less expensive than a similarly loaded 3er or C etc. If he got one, it would be the diesel. I think he said it was about 60K the way he wants it. Maybe dieselgate fallout will make them hard to move, and increase incentives (he won't actually be making a move for several months)."

AMG GT will probably have a high depreciation floor, judging by past history for cars like SLS, SLR, Black Series, etc."
30,2017-01-07T19:51:37+00:00,berri,"gb - get any sudden brake and turns behind the Honda? Those are good for the reflexes, but maybe not so much for the heart"
31,2017-01-07T20:04:50+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Anything with ""AMG"" written on it is probably going to behave like a cinder block dropped off a bridge. Consider the SL65 AMG fer instance."
32,2017-01-07T20:08:09+00:00,fintail,"Those are based on volume models, and are unlimited production. When something is unique (SLR, SLS, GT), or with very limited production (Black Series), values seem to evaporate more slowly. A huge chunk in the first few years for those cars, but then stabilize, unlike a normal SL or S etc AMG, which gets down to 7-10K or so before it finally bottoms out."
33,2017-01-09T19:12:21+00:00,tifighter,I sorta have my eyes out for something like a SLK55 some day. Earlier generation. I could see a nice one eventually even going up in the far flung future.
34,2017-01-09T20:00:44+00:00,fintail,"Still depreciating, maybe a special interest car in 25 years. I looked at one once - I am only moderately tall, but couldn't get a comfortable seating position, the top windshield bar annoyed me."
35,2017-01-09T21:52:45+00:00,tifighter,"I admittedly have not sat in one. I sorta assumed it must have a little more room inside than my old Miata, but I may be wrong."
36,2017-01-10T14:37:16+00:00,anythngbutgm,"Most ironic sighting of 2017, a Caddy SRX with 3 Trump stickers on the back..."
37,2017-01-10T16:01:55+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"They're already pretty cheap in the $15K range for nice ones, and probably going to be a lot cheaper. My two cents is that they will behave historically like the old V-8 SLs, and eventually drop into the $6,000 range for the earliest ones (2008?)."
38,2017-01-10T16:46:21+00:00,tifighter,"I forgot how much cheaper cars were living in NoCal. These are in the 20's up here, and there aren't many to choose from. Must resist temptation to open bay area listings..."
39,2017-01-10T17:05:06+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Here, let me enable you

http://sacramento.craigslist.org/cto/5937977894.html

Actually I couldn't find one at the moment advertised at $15K but I bet you could bargain some of these down to that price. It's not an easy car to unload."
40,2017-01-10T17:18:42+00:00,tifighter,"""Vehicle has 10,000 of extra chrome installed""

You can't make this stuff up..."
41,2017-01-10T17:24:49+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well consider the car you're dealing with here. If the Porsche 928 were the ""German Corvette"" then the SLK55 is the German Allante."
42,2017-01-10T17:28:10+00:00,qbrozen,sheepskin covers? really? ugh.
43,2017-01-10T17:29:48+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Sometimes, in a darker mood, I think the SLK is kind of a parody of itself"
44,2017-01-10T17:48:42+00:00,fintail,"I run from old MBs with wheels like that. The seat covers are icing on the cake. There are a couple on local CL in the 20K range - never buy the cheapest MB, it often ends up being the most expensive.

They'll drop down to near 10K, but I don't see less than that, especially if we have any inflation. Convertible + AMG helps."
45,2017-01-10T18:07:57+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Depends how many get junked. Fewer survivors = higher resale.
46,2017-01-10T20:58:26+00:00,fintail,"They are a fairly simple car, no supercharger or air suspension etc. to hasten their demise. Pretty rare to begin with though."
47,2017-01-10T21:20:27+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Some big depreciators are Genesis, Jaguar XK, Lincoln MSK, Mercedes S Class.

Mini Cooper and Cadillac CTS are also bad.

Oddly enough, the Range Rover doesn't, very much. Go figure. And of course Toyota Tacoma, practically nothing."
48,2017-01-10T22:19:09+00:00,fintail,"I think the time of depreciation may be a key. Range Rover seems to hold value well for a few years, then boom! it's all gone and just like a German barge, maybe worse past the decade point.

I have to imagine 7er and A8 are just as bad a S-class, seeing as 10 year old examples aren't worth a fortune now."
49,2017-01-10T22:20:52+00:00,tifighter,I see the small car/big engine combo always being desirable. Especially NA engines; some people just don't like smaller turbos. It's already happening down the street in Stuttgart with that other carmaker...
0,2017-01-10T22:52:06+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Open top cars will always get some interest, but not necessarily respect."
1,2017-01-10T22:52:18+00:00,kyfdx,"I've got a line on a '97 Range Rover.. $500!!

Shifty thinks it is a bad deal."
2,2017-01-10T22:55:34+00:00,texases,"Years ago someone on one of these discussions described their experience with a their 10-year-old Jaguar, bought new. The dealer didn't want it back in trade! That's some depreciation."
3,2017-01-10T22:59:10+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Hey, no fair-----I'm all for you buying it. I got my popcorn, my beach chair and I'm ready for the daily blogs.

I'm virtually squealing in anticipation."

6,2017-01-10T23:44:23+00:00,qbrozen,Betcha you could easily recoup your money by selling the wheels and get paid scrap money for the rest of that '97 RR. 
7,2017-01-11T02:20:40+00:00,fintail,"I think a SLK will bottom out no lower than 10K - in today's money, and that's for a legitimately decent car. Older E55 and S55 are stabilizing around there, and the older C AMGs aren't much less - mind you, this is for nice cars, and there are many neglected ones out there.

Speaking of AMG, I was behind a white C63S AMG on the way home today."
8,2017-01-11T02:53:02+00:00,tlong,I saw one of those BMW things that is fairly large and looks like a Mazda 3 hatchback on steroids. Looks kind of silly but could not get close enough to read the badge.
9,2017-01-11T03:06:27+00:00,fintail,"With BMW's lineup, that could be a few things, but I suspect it is this:



Behold the tasteful and elegant X4. They are relatively common in this area, as some demographics love such things."
10,2017-01-11T03:19:32+00:00,kyfdx,"That actually looks better than the X6. That look seems to fit the smaller body, better."
11,2017-01-11T14:50:02+00:00,fintail,"Still looks awkward to me, like a hatchback on stilts. I guess that's what a CUV is anyway."
12,2017-01-11T17:08:29+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Niche marketing gone crazy.
13,2017-01-11T17:10:31+00:00,kyfdx,"SUV/CUVs are up to something like 63% of passenger car sales. I don't think it's much of a ""niche"" any more. A coupe is now a ""niche"" car."
14,2017-01-11T17:24:10+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah true but this is just a hatchback version of the X3, trying to lure that occasional Macan or RX buyer away---offering less practicality for the sake of styling. And now they're offering an M version, which pretty much wipes out any ground clearance advantage of owning the X4 in the first place, while upping the price close to an X6.

If that's not ""niche-crazy"", I don't know what it."
15,2017-01-11T17:28:17+00:00,fintail,"The Germans are definitely out-nicheing everyone. X1, X3, X4, X5, X6, eventual X7, and there's an X2 concept now. MB has GLA, GLC, GLE, GLE coupe, GLS, G-Wagen. Ride height makes easy access for oldsters and false confidence for the inept. And just as important, it is trendy, kind of showy - turn heads at the mall."
16,2017-01-11T17:28:54+00:00,ab348,"There are times when a CUV/SUV does seem appealing to me despite how much I love the driving experience of the ATS. Like when I was shopping for a headboard for my bed. They all come in large boxes, no way can I possibly get it home with my car, even if the rear seat folded down, which it doesn't. It has been almost 20 years since I had a car where the rear seat didn't fold. I didn't even bother to check that before buying since I just assumed it was so. But Caddy doesn't give you one unless you move up a model level. Crazy.

But having said that, it is usually one or two times a year I need that capacity, and I would be saddled with a ponderous driving experience the rest of the time."
17,2017-01-11T17:49:29+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,You can rent a pickup for 1/2 day pretty darn cheaply.
18,2017-01-11T18:26:18+00:00,ab348,Or I can get my brother to use his Ford Ranger for free!
19,2017-01-11T18:38:49+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"borrowing from family is never ""free""

(Don Corleone voice): ""And someday, ab348, you may be asked to do something for us in return""."
20,2017-01-11T19:49:38+00:00,stickguy,"Well, I think moving to hatch/wagon style is a good thing. I find them much more useful. The silly part is jacking them all up, and often putting AWD on. A normal ride height wagon drives just like a sedan. But can hold a lot more.

Hey, I'm still in the years of carting mucho junk back and forth to college. So big bulk cargo capacity is important to me! Plus, better set up for transporting a dog."
21,2017-01-11T19:53:39+00:00,texases,"I like our CUV. Better in the ways that count to me: More headroom, front and rear, great legroom, so can fit 4 tall (6' 5"" for two of them) adults with no head bumping. Easier in/out, better visibility, and MUCH more flexible in terms of carrying things/dog/dog crate/etc. Does it use a bit (20%) more gas? Sure. Does it not handle quite as well? Not to me, in 99% of my boring driving.

The supposed deficiencies of CUVs are the favorite whipping boy of much of the car press, but most of the reasons cited are either out of date or unimportant to most drivers. Would I like a Boxster, if I lived somewhere it would be fun? Sure, but that's not here."
22,2017-01-11T21:08:19+00:00,qbrozen,Just read MB is bringing an E400 wagon here. Looks pretty sweet.
23,2017-01-11T23:31:40+00:00,stickguy,"on the big side. as is the V90. A nice V60 CPO, that could work."
24,2017-01-11T23:50:14+00:00,explorerx4,The X4 rear exhaust looks really cheap. I was behind one the other day.
25,2017-01-12T00:18:01+00:00,qbrozen,"Eh, only about 10 inches longer than the V60, yet about a half inch narrower."
26,2017-01-12T00:31:45+00:00,stickguy,"I really prefer smaller cars now. The RDX is plenty long enough (183""?). It is just somewhat wide, with a big blocky front end that makes in seem bigger than it really is.

something in the 175-185"" range will work. Don't really want to be pushing 200"" again."
27,2017-01-12T02:02:02+00:00,fintail,"I'd rather have a C wagon, but the E probably has better profit margins, so it will be here first."
28,2017-01-12T02:03:09+00:00,stickguy,"a C wagon could be real tasty. And very, very expensive new."
29,2017-01-12T02:10:26+00:00,fintail,"Nicely equipped E wagon is going to pass 70K without much effort. Equivalent C would likely be in the 50s.

Of course, it's moot for me, as I'd want a diesel, and VW has put that on hold for almost everyone for at least the near future."
30,2017-01-12T03:08:00+00:00,tifighter,"I looked at the E wagon during the last shop. It is a nice car, but the cost difference between it and the Volvo more than paid for adding solar to our house. And the Volvo isn't exactly a penalty box. Still, the new gen E does look pretty nice, and you aren't forced into a little engine only like the new V90."
31,2017-01-12T05:35:09+00:00,tlong,"Yes, they've really outdone themselves this time, haven't they?
They lost my interest anyway when they Americanized their sedans a few years ago.
I'm all for their top brass being arrested in the country. But don't I wish the banks would've had quite a few scores of their execs put in the slammer for torching the economy in 2008? You betcha."
32,2017-01-12T14:42:16+00:00,fintail,"I am not too upset about VW hurting themselves, as there aren't a lot of VAG products I really pine for. For VW, I'd be most likely to consider the Alltrack or maybe some kind of AWD Passat (I know, not a thing here), but I would want diesel for any of them. This is off the shelf now, maybe forever in this market. The diesel name has been harmed as a whole too, which no upcoming MB diesels having any kind of ETA here.

I have no problem with financial penalties, but I think arrests may be heavy handed looking at how few (virtually zero) have been arrested for similar crimes. Law enforcement and the justice system as a whole have to be consistent to be credible - and they are sorely lacking in credibility right now. But when you are handsomely rewarded and effectively can't be fired, why not use some ego? IMO, that's a key driver in this - federal regulator types take themselves very seriously, and when it is shown to the public that they were fooled, they take it personally. The amounts of the fines also must be consistent, and I don't think they are. It'll be interesting if this same thing continues in the new regime. With the swamp about to be drained of old vermin, to be replaced with a new mixture of crocodiles. piranhas, and vultures, it will be interesting.

No doubt numerous FIRE sector trash along wish some political/praetorian leadership types of the past few decades deserve the slammer a lot more. We have a few who are effectively war criminals who roam around with impunity today. Maybe a discussion for another venue"
33,2017-01-12T14:45:11+00:00,fintail,"You could probably approach 1.5 or more Volvos for the price of a really loaded E Wagon, which is priced more like an XC90.

As the US hasn't had a diesel E wagon in decades, I don't know if we'll ever have one again."
34,2017-01-12T17:23:51+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"It seems like the very reasons to own a diesel are being eroded by ever more clever new technologies in automotive propulsion. Fuel economy, torque---these once unassailable bastions of diesel cars are being eradicated."
35,2017-01-12T21:56:47+00:00,PF_Flyer,"A reporter is looking to talk to someone who was originally shopping for a new car, but decided to buy a CPO vehicle instead because it was a better deal.

36,2017-01-13T01:58:46+00:00,fintail,"Saw 2 new C coupes this evening. I've also been seeing more illuminated grille stars lately, still seems a bit tacky to me. But maybe fitting for the mysteriously monied demographic around here."

40,2017-01-14T19:13:19+00:00,ab348,"Three years ago when I was working, our CEO took a shine to one of the local private liquor retail CEOs and they started having lunch together, etc. This guy had been one of the biggest regional independent cellphone retailers back in the '90s and early '00s before selling out to Bell. He was reported to have made $150 million on the deal. He is an ex-prizefighter and a bit of an odd duck, never says much, not well-educated, not someone you would want angry with you, but a self-made man and an interesting businessman. I actually like him because you always know exactly where you stand with him. He took the $150 mil and bought up a bunch of other businesses, did well with some, ran others into the ground. Spent a chunk of it on a lavish lakefront home that he recently demolished and rebuilt. And on a string of expensive cars.

One day I was in my office, which was immediately above our Exec parking and main entrance. Normally I never heard anything from down there but this day I heard a rorty exhaust note. I looked out my window to see him leaving in his Bentley Continental coupe. Wow, what a sound. That was one of his summer cars. His winter car was a M-B S-Class. Probably along with a half-dozen others apiece in either category.

Almost as bad as @breld..."
41,2017-01-14T22:10:26+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new Ridgeline today, reminds me of a cut-down Pilot.

re: Bentley, South Beach/Miami is definitely a good place if you like them, dime a dozen there. Not too unusual in pricier west coast areas either. I don't think it is the prettiest car ever, but the Continental design has aged very well. Earlier ones can now be had for the price of a moderately equipped C/3er etc, shouldn't be tempting but somehow is.

CEO's other car is a Ferrari 458, which I see at least weekly. I prefer older models, my head turns more at a 328 than at a new one."

6,2017-01-16T02:42:17+00:00,fintail,"I think I see more 86-91s still on the road than 2nd gen - maybe due to the 3.8 becoming more common. My uncle had an early 86 with the 3.0, which I guess was the Vulcan even then (?). I don't think he had engine issues, but at a little over 100K, the transmission went out - I remember this as I was in the car at the time. My grandma has an ~03 Taurus with the Vulcan, I think she put about 35K miles on it, and now my uncle drives her places in it. Never had a mechanical issue, and few other issues. Not the most sophisticated car, but they could be had cheap even when new, and seem to hold up with maintenance.

On the new car front, saw a few new Volvo S90s sitting on the lot, and a new E-class in traffic."

I have managed to get another rental Dodge Dart while visiting my mom in Northern California.

In addition to the observations I had with my previous Dart rental (sea of black, poor ergonomics, rear view mirror in the near-center of the windshield), another item to add-

The tach and speedometers are so far apart (with the speedo on the right) that if I adjust the steering wheel to where I want it, it cuts the upper right portion of the speedo off, meaning I either lean down to see the speedo or raise the steering wheel higher than it should be. And of course this is the portion of the speedo that shows 50-80 or so mph, which is right where you normally need to see it while on the highway."

Since the mid 80s it's been a handful of Houston and mostly Dallas shows for me.

Several missing upcoming models, few you could sit in, and the ones you could sit in were unkempt and missing knobs and switches.

Yeah, a few concepts don't make it, and IIRC that long ago the show was earlier in the year, and at the same time as Detroit maybe? Basically they competed with a more prestigious show, and lost. They do now get a decent number of upcoming models, but unless they are really imminent, they get put up on a platform and you can't get in. But they have all the new production models.

Between that and stop/start that cannot be turned off I am thinking maybe I should keep what I have.
22,2017-01-27T02:19:04+00:00,fintail,"I saw another new Lacrosse today, this one not a rental. It is nice looking, but if that shifter is bad, it might turn off the traditional Buick demographic (who already seem to also go to Avalon/ES anyway).

It's the same in WA regarding domestics. I see smaller models that are private cars, but anytime I see a new 300, Taurus, or Impala, I look for (a lack of) plate frames and (numerous) barcodes."

- Prices getting high. Most highly optioned ones (non luxury makes) were in the mid 30's.
- Subaru Outback - nice interior, lower and longer than others
- Subaru Forrester - still looks kind of dowdy, but eminently practical
- RAV4 - Even with leather the interior still seems cheap. And among the most expensive against its peers
- CRV - nice interior but I still find it ugly and a mess from a design perspective. But I'm sure a good vehicle
- CX-5 - The cheapest fully loaded (more like $31K). Quite nice interior but not as much interior color options, you have black and black+beige seats. The rest of the interior is always all black. Due to be refreshed shortly.
- Escape - This is a nice vehicle, doesn't seem as overstyled inside as I remember it (or perhaps we're getting used to it). Seems tighter inside than the others, especially width and leg width. Among the more expensive (Titanium model $36K)"
11,2017-02-11T18:50:40+00:00,kyfdx,"I agree that the CX-5 interior seems sort of low-rent and dated, compared to its peers. I'll be interested to see the new one."
12,2017-02-11T20:25:27+00:00,fintail,"Stopped by the MB dealer today, a few less usual cars hanging around. Highlight was an S65 Cabrio, sticker was 253K IIRC. Amusing that the metallic white paint is still a $900 option when base price is 247K - Willkommen in Deutschland! Also a GLC43 AMG at 68K, a C300 cabrio seemed a bargain at 62K, and an E43 AMG was being wheeled in to the showroom, but had no sticker. A host of normal cars too of course, and quite a few people in the showroom. Used section had a 2014 C63 listed at 53K (I think), and a W205 C300 with the odd luxury grille, seldom seen.

I will say their service isn't bad. I stopped in to get a keyfob battery for the spare key - free of charge. There was also a guy there looking for plastic clips, I think bumper clips for a W211. The parts guy gave him a few for free."
13,2017-02-11T21:08:23+00:00,explorerx4,"I saw my first Model X today. Doesn't look very good. Styling fits Model S much better.
Got my wife's MKC serviced today, but forgot to go to the showroom to see if they have a Continental."
14,2017-02-12T00:37:53+00:00,tifighter,"Today in Berkeley- two new Alfa Giulias, one silver and one red. Base models. Not bad but they didn't blow me away. Also saw my first Bolt, in forgettable silver."
15,2017-02-12T00:46:22+00:00,stickguy,another new Pilot with temp tags in my neighborhood. Seems to be popular.
16,2017-02-12T01:35:40+00:00,fushigi,"It's a pretty broad segment now. Even with what you listed there's the Rogue, Sportage / Tucson, and Outlander Sport to consider. If FWD is fine, consider the hybrid Kia Niro .. gets something like 46MPG with a sticker of $28-32K.

Here's the ""Star Wars Rogue"" from the Chicago Auto Show. Note the stormtrooper int he background; Nissan had 2 there posing for pics with the guests."
17,2017-02-17T02:23:42+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new NSX today, first one for me.

Also a later S63 with a ""driver"" who had a phone to his ear and didn't bother with signals. Must be all of that hard work and responsibility at play."
18,2017-02-17T03:19:13+00:00,qbrozen,I have noticed quite a few drivers with high-end newer cars with phones to ears. What the hell is that all about? Inability to figure out the BT?
19,2017-02-17T04:15:34+00:00,fintail,"Ineptitude and probably some simple lack of self-awareness, too. When you won't be held accountable, why bother? These are the early adopters of microwaves and VCRs who had blinking clocks 35 years ago. I don't exactly have a PhD in computer science, yet I've never had an issue pairing BT to a car."
20,2017-02-18T02:11:10+00:00,tjc78,I point that out the wife all the time.  Just yesterday woman driving a new S-class with an IPhone to her ear.  No way in hell that car didn't have BT.  
21,2017-02-22T02:08:20+00:00,fintail,"Saw a highline Malibu today, with the big sunroof. Kind of unusual. Also spotted a McLaren, these things just don't impress me anymore. A white late model AMG G-Wagen rounded out the class and taste."
22,2017-02-22T02:22:32+00:00,tjc78,"At work a brand new XC90, appeared really optioned up with 22"" wheels.  Really a looker, IMO."
23,2017-02-22T04:10:58+00:00,Michaell,"Every time I travel to the Bay Area to visit company HQ, there is a McLaren dealership on my drive from the hotel to the office."
24,2017-02-22T04:14:26+00:00,texases,"All 345 recent McLaren models look the same to me. And OK, but not great. "
25,2017-02-22T17:15:50+00:00,anythngbutgm,Checked out the new V90 Cross Country last night while I was there looking at V60CC. That thing is huge!
26,2017-02-22T17:39:46+00:00,kyfdx,Saw one at the car show a couple of weeks ago. I like it! (except the price)
27,2017-02-22T19:30:54+00:00,anythngbutgm,"The one on the floor had a price tag of 66k and change which puts it in the exact price range as a comparable XC90.

I think I'd actually go for the XC90 just because of V90's length even tho I much prefer wagons over SUV's.

Still, it gives me hope the next V60 gets the same details, it was quite nice. Interior is just as stunning as the XC90 (not surprising).

On a side note, I test drove the new V60CC. Although it cannot be considered ""Spotted a new Model"" since it is now a year or 2 old and was still on the showroom floor, it was pretty nice. Interior is a bit dated now since it goes back to the original 60 series but it is still a nice place to be. I love the seats, best in the industry IMO. I also thought I was going to dislike the T-5's 4-cylinder Turbo but it was quite peppy. It's definitely not the rocketship 3.0 Turbo Straight six, but it was plenty spunky. One thing I absolutely hate is the Stop/Start tho. If I can, I pledge never to buy a car with it. Ever... But for 40g, it was certainly a step above a loaded Outback 3.6R in interior, seats, power and definitely gas mileage. Not sure if I'm going to jump on buying one or wait for the new XC40 tho..."
28,2017-02-22T19:35:18+00:00,berri,"Next time you test drive one, see if you can turn the stop start off. I think on some cars you can, but not on others. I don't like that feature either and unless you are stopping an awful lot. I suspect the fuel advantage is quite minimal compared to the annoyance and possible resulting complications if the system goes haywire down the road."
29,2017-02-22T21:24:47+00:00,explorerx4,"Volvo's start/stop is pretty unrefined. My neighbor had an XC60 as a loaner for several months.
We went for a ride and it's very ragged. He was afraid to disable it, so I had to listen to him complain about it.
My Fusion has start/stop. When you stop the car just gets quiet. You notice the engine starting, but just a little kick plus the sound."
30,2017-02-22T21:34:44+00:00,ab348,"I've had it on both Chevy and Cadillac loaners and even though it is MOSTLY unobtrusive, you occasionally feel it restart. That alone is enough to make me not want it. Unfortunately the GM implementations are required to meet their EPA mileage ratings, so it cannot be turned off easily."
31,2017-02-22T21:35:09+00:00,tifighter,The new Drive-E V60CC should be hitting dealers now. Car and Driver has a write up on it; sounds like the 8 speed AT is a nice improvement.
32,2017-02-22T22:17:40+00:00,Michaell,The loaner MINI I had on Monday offers start/stop. I disabled it.
33,2017-02-22T22:44:30+00:00,qbrozen,"Had an ATS loaner with start/stop. It did not actually turn itself off very often. It seemed to me if I slowed down to a crawl and then feathered the brakes to a stop, it would not shut off the engine. Only if I came to a stop with steady pressure on the brake pedal the whole way would it shut off the engine."
34,2017-02-22T23:41:52+00:00,fushigi,Some work that way to try to figure out if you're coming to a red light (steady braking .. OK to shut off) or in heavy traffic where the stop/start can cause delays/problems.
35,2017-02-23T00:35:10+00:00,imidazol97,"There's an input that's the percent of brake pedal depression. Harder than that and the S/S can operate. If you apply brakes lightly or lighten pressure just before dead stop, the car doesn't meet the % brake pedal for S/S. Then there are many other factors including the HVAC system and demand vs outside temp vs actual cabin temp."
36,2017-02-24T22:56:59+00:00,andres3,"Could it be a work phone, and only the personal phone is paired via Bluetooth? Probably a lot harder to pair multiple phones for the same person? I haven't tried yet, and I should !

I know in the old diesel VW you had to select one phone/user at a time."
37,2017-02-24T23:04:28+00:00,andres3,"Not sure the T5 drive-train has any advantage power wise over Subaru's 3.6 engine, but I'd agree Volvo is a step up, but also in price."
38,2017-02-24T23:15:58+00:00,Michaell,I've got both my personal iPhone and my work iPhone paired to the Jetta concurrently. I had to rename my work phone so I knew which was which.
39,2017-02-24T23:25:28+00:00,fintail,"I am pretty sure multiple phones can be paired at once, and multiple phones can definitely be stored in the memory."
40,2017-02-25T00:41:06+00:00,tjc78,"Yes multiple phones no problem, but most only allow on connected at a time.  "
41,2017-02-25T00:50:24+00:00,tlong,Saw a McLaren in the parking lot. Beautiful in orange even if I wouldn't buy one...
42,2017-02-25T13:51:32+00:00,kyfdx,"How is holding a phone to your ear any different than drinking from your big gulp? It's not like anyone is driving a stick shift, any more (except me).

Holding phone to your ear = OK
Looking down at your text messages = NOT ok"
43,2017-02-25T16:01:00+00:00,fintail,"Holding food/drink/cig/pet/kid while driving results in just as much stupidity no doubt, it just isn't the flavor of the day in terms of outrage."
44,2017-02-25T16:13:39+00:00,kyfdx,"Studies quoted in newspapers, etc.. say it's the distraction of the phone call itself that is the problem, not the fact that you are holding the phone. I'd have to agree with that.

The bonus of those that use bluetooth is they probably don't keep the phone handy to look at text messages. It's not the holding (phone, cig, big gulp) that is the problem, it's the distraction.

So, my ranking of distraction problems:

1) Texting
2) Talking on phone (bluetooth or not)
3) Passenger who won't shut up (especially those who don't pay attention to driving situations)
4) Drinking/eating while driving a stick-shift (that one is mostly for me). I think this is why they invented longnecks, before we had cupholders."
45,2017-02-25T18:33:48+00:00,berri,"4) Drinking/eating while driving a stick-shift (that one is mostly for me). I think this is why they invented longnecks, before we had cupholders

hahaha !"
46,2017-02-25T20:01:06+00:00,stickguy,"I drove sticks as my main car for about 35 years. I never had any problem eating or drinking while doing so. Just took a little more creativity, and coordination.

I really should get another stick when I replace my car. While I still have a chance!"
47,2017-02-25T20:06:37+00:00,fintail,"Studies can be made to show a lot, but I have to believe that physically holding a device and usually looking at it while talking creates a different real world result than yapping toward a speaker with hands on the wheel and not looking at a phone. It might not even create more crashes, but more stupid slow inconsiderate driving, the kind the LEO community hasn't yet wanted to touch."
48,2017-02-25T21:14:27+00:00,ab348,"I found even with Bluetooth, I felt distracted on a phone conversation while driving, at least when it was an important discussion that required thinking. It seemed to take away from my ability to focus on my driving. ."
49,2017-02-25T21:45:54+00:00,stickguy,"I seem to recall studies saying that. Basically it is mentally focusing on the call, not holding the phone, that is the problem. But at least with bluetooth, have 2 hands available for the wheel!"
0,2017-02-25T22:24:58+00:00,berri,I believe the problem with today in many things is that people think they are more proficient at multitasking than they really are.
1,2017-02-26T01:38:22+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"The human brain CAN'T multitask at all. You are either doing A or B, but not both at the same time with equal concentration---not even close."
2,2017-02-26T02:52:37+00:00,berri,"The real problem may be that too many people know they've got to do A and B, but can't prioritize or spatially coordinate the tasks. Maybe a little too much ""me"" focus."
3,2017-02-26T02:58:13+00:00,stickguy,"house around the corner from me has a new TLX with a temp tag. I still really like these, but you just don't see too many."
4,2017-02-26T03:25:31+00:00,tjc78,The Accord Touring (or whatever the top line model is ) is probably so good it doesn't pay to spend more. 
5,2017-03-01T15:55:17+00:00,fintail,Saw my first Maserati Levante on the road - yet another Stepfordian mallcruiser for the idle leisure set.
6,2017-03-01T21:45:15+00:00,laurasdada,Why would anyone buy a Levante when they could have an F-Pace!
7,2017-03-02T02:07:18+00:00,fintail,"Or a normal sedan

A few new models on the road this afternoon:

New style CRV, Genesis G90, GLC coupe, E-class, and the grand whale of them all - a Bentayga. Of course, the ""driver"" was holding a phone while ""driving""."
8,2017-03-02T03:46:43+00:00,kyfdx,"I see a lot of new 2017 CR-Vs. Might be the best looking CR-V, yet."
9,2017-03-02T04:54:09+00:00,berri,Kind of makes you wonder in most circumstances if the next size up crossover is worth an extra $10K
10,2017-03-02T07:30:52+00:00,tlong,"Kydfx - well I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. My wife and I took a look and test drive of the latest CR-V. I personally find its styling a mess, don't like the looks at all. We sat in the premium model. The interior is generally pretty nice, but I find the fake plastic wood particularly tacky looking. There is also a big ledge between the back cargo area and the top of the rear seats when folded down - there is like a 4 inch cliff up to the flag folded seatbacks on an otherwise flat load floor. Doesn't makes sense to me."
11,2017-03-02T12:30:06+00:00,ab348,"I saw a first edition CR-V on the roads this week - nowadays, a very rare sight around here as they all seem to have disappeared and I haven't spotted one in a while - and was stunned by how small it appeared Was it based on the Civic platform of the day? I always assumed the vehicle was spun off from an Accord but that made me realize it couldn't be the case."
12,2017-03-02T14:06:18+00:00,kyfdx,"Well.. I can't see inside, as they drive by.."
13,2017-03-02T14:09:50+00:00,kyfdx,"Yes, first generation was Civic platform and engine. 2nd generation was still Civic platform, but Accord engine.

I had a '98 with a stick... You really got to wind out the gears. If you like driving a stick, it was a lot of fun. That one died a horrible death in 2002, and I bought a Gen 2 automatic. Drove that one for 100K+ miles. Repair costs were terrible... $11 + maintenance for the 106K miles and 6.5 years."
14,2017-03-02T14:16:53+00:00,fintail,"Funny how older car survival is so regional - I see first gen CRV virtually every day. Some of them are pretty beat up, but they are still moving along. I suspect they aren't immune to rot, especially underneath."
15,2017-03-02T15:25:44+00:00,stickguy,"I agree about not wanting to spend so much money for the bit of extra room in a pilot over a CRV, since I have zero need for an emergency only 3rd row (and if i did, would still have a minivan!)

as to the trunk, I think it has a multi level rear floor. At least, it did. Or I am confusing it with a different car. In any case, you can set it at the low position for more cargo space, or raise to top spot to make a flat floor with the seats down.

and does this model have sliding rear seats? A number of wagons like this end up with a gap if you slide the back seat forward."
16,2017-03-02T20:50:56+00:00,anythngbutgm,"I came close to buying one of the first ones when they came out, a 97 Black, AWD with a stick when I was first looking to dump my 6 month old lemon Exploder. It was pretty slow with only 128hp (power was bumped to 148 for 98') but it was nimble and tossable. Dealer offer the same exact payments as I had on my Exploder so I walked because I thought of it as somewhat of a downgrade.

4 months later, I dumped it for an Accord"
17,2017-03-03T02:02:32+00:00,fintail,"Saw a MB S600 non-Maybach today today, pretty rare car, probably sold at maybe 1:500 of normal S550. Also saw a S600 Maybach and a GLE with an illuminated grille star."
18,2017-03-07T02:13:18+00:00,fintail,"Saw another new NSX, or probably the same one, as it was the same color. A poorly driven AMG G-Wagen was also a fun sight, and a hockey stick 7er rounded out the afternoon.

And not new, but I am pretty sure I saw a Lexus LS600h, pretty rare car, that might be an LS I'd buy just for the unicorn status."
19,2017-03-10T02:17:24+00:00,fintail,"Another Levante today, and a red 911 Targa."
20,2017-03-10T18:54:06+00:00,laurasdada,I want the latest edition Targa. Just love Rube Goldberg contraptions! Of course I could get a Miata RF and save a pretty penny.
21,2017-03-11T21:42:00+00:00,tlong,I saw a Tesla Model S driving down the freeway yesterday with a bike rack hanging off the rear bumper. This was in Silicon Valley...
22,2017-03-12T16:43:45+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,an electric bike no doubt?

24,2017-03-18T01:00:14+00:00,fintail,"At work today saw a brand new unplated X1 with what looks like a white or very very light beige interior, kind of unusual color. Also parked next to me the past two days, maybe a Challenger Hellcat? SRT at any rate, it has some kind of animal head fender badge. Out of state plates, probably parking by me because I park with care, mirrors folded, up against a pole, so the Challenger would have more room for the huge door."
25,2017-03-18T02:38:45+00:00,tlong,"A pink Fiat 500. At a regional park, where people often hike...
Is that a factory color (I doubt it) or one of those cosmetic selling cars, etc.?"
26,2017-03-18T02:39:33+00:00,tlong,I really try to avoid parking next to the driver's side of two door cars.
27,2017-03-18T02:54:39+00:00,kyfdx,"I think they call that interior, Oyster."
28,2017-03-18T03:24:50+00:00,fintail,"Me too, but I was there first. I usually assume/hope that someone driving something that is kind of an enthusiast car will also be more careful. I try to keep away from big trucks and Stepfordian CUVs/SUVs."
29,2017-03-20T14:33:36+00:00,fintail,"Got behind a GLE43 coupe yesterday while in the fintail. It was different, that's all I will say."
30,2017-03-20T16:08:32+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,It doesn't work. There's neither the angularity of a trunk or the cut-off of a hatch or the grace of a fastback---it's a blob.
31,2017-03-20T16:28:35+00:00,fintail,It's a MB X4/X6. These brands now copy and out-niche each other more than anything.
32,2017-03-21T00:59:17+00:00,fintail,"Saw my first new Lincoln Continental on the road. Appeared to be in livery service, that might not bode well. Also a S600 Maybach, perfect if you made your money in the laundry business (and I don't mean like George Jefferson), and another GLE43 coupe."
33,2017-03-21T01:07:00+00:00,qbrozen,Saw my first S90 on the road today. It was a steelish powder blue yet still looked quite macho (mostly due to those taillights) for a volvo.
34,2017-03-21T01:55:00+00:00,stickguy,"I am really interested in seeing the upcoming XC60. I am sure the wife will be perfectly happy to trade in the RDX on one of those. Only wrinkle in the plan is waiting to hit MegaMillions first so we can pay for it.

back about 20-25 years ago when I traveled a lot on business, I used Boston Coach often. For a while they used S80 Volvos. Then they moved onto big Caddys (FWD devilles IIRC). Might have been something else along the way, but those are the ones I remember. Probably sold a few customers for the car companies, since it mostly businessmen using the service that could become interested in the cars from the back seat!"
36,2017-03-22T01:08:53+00:00,fintail,"On the road today - GLC coupe (not a MAzda - if an X4 is just too brash), hockey stick 7er."
37,2017-03-22T16:16:42+00:00,andres3,"speaking of rare, ever see a 30+ year old Audi moving along the road?

I remember when my mechanic let me borrow his early 80's coupe that I felt part of a very exclusive club since I had probably the only 30+ year old Audi on the road being used that day in all of CA."
38,2017-03-22T17:33:11+00:00,fintail,"Being in the PNW, I see an Audi of that era now and then. Usually a 4000, but there's a GT Coupe in the area I see now and then. There are a couple of 5000s seen every blue moon or so, too."
39,2017-03-22T17:51:41+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"The 4000s weren't too bad a car. They could stretch out the miles if you took care of them.

They have certainly gotten more reliable and more fun to drive over the years."
40,2017-03-22T17:59:47+00:00,fintail,"I know it irks the devotees of the 4 rings to make ""gussied up VW"" claimss, but I think the 4000 was much the same as a same era Passat/Quantum. This lineage would lead to the A4 of today, I suppose. A Quantum, there's something not seen too often these days. Surprisingly enough, there are 2 of each on local CL right now."
41,2017-03-22T18:23:09+00:00,andres3,"I suppose in the early 80's Audi's were far more affordable apparently, and hadn't made the move yet to be a ""luxury"" division. They certainly went more upscale with the original A4."
42,2017-03-22T18:28:13+00:00,kyfdx,"That is definitely not the case. Audi, BMW, Mercedes, etc, etc... were very expensive in the '80s"
43,2017-03-22T18:33:24+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, an Audi back then wasn't priced like an S-class, but it wasn't a cheap car. I could see a 1980 Audi 5000 being 15K in those dollars, anyway (where a normal diesel W123 was probably 20K+). Not as luxurious as modern models either, but that was true for German cars as a whole."
44,2017-03-22T19:28:08+00:00,Michaell,"When I was still living in CA, my mom and dad's next door neighbor bought a 4000. Kind of a 7-Up can green, and it was the 5+5 (5-cylinder + 5-speed)"

46,2017-03-22T21:45:12+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"New Audi RS3 is a 5-er but there aren't many anymore. But for some reason, 3 cylinders are still in the game."
47,2017-03-22T21:55:26+00:00,berri,I think most of today's 3 cylinders are turbos? If that is the case maybe it compensates a bit?
48,2017-03-22T22:12:00+00:00,stickguy,stopped at a light today next to an X6. Quite odd looking. But tall.
49,2017-03-23T00:59:56+00:00,fintail,"MB day - saw 2 new MB ""coupes"" today, a new E that might have been a rental (basic looking, out of state plates with no frames), red G63 that screamed sketchy money, and a zillion Teslas as usual.

Speaking of old Audis, I remember back in the 80s, my mom had a friend who had a 4000 coupe. I think it was brown, it seemed a little unusual then and is a unicorn today."
0,2017-03-24T02:29:53+00:00,fintail,"Saw a blue NSX again today, has to be the same car."
1,2017-03-25T08:05:22+00:00,tifighter,Spotted this week in Zurich. Whatever it is...
2,2017-03-25T09:39:59+00:00,iluvmysephia1,Possibly the new Kia Rio for 2018?
3,2017-03-25T15:38:37+00:00,fintail,"If only you had got a pic of the plates

There's definitely some tricky red herring in that camouflage, with the hood bulge and design on the C-pillar."
4,2017-03-25T18:06:12+00:00,fintail,"Went out for an errand, saw some new 5ers on the BMW lot. Stopped to take a look - definitely sharper looking than the prior car. A nicely optioned one is 66K. I don't think there's a diesel yet. It was parked beside a black 6er GC with a white interior. The rest of the stuff on the lot was more normal, most interesting was the used car side, which had a couple of year old hockey stick 7ers, and a loaded 2012 S-class, sadly a V8 and not a diesel.

Also stopped by MB to get a key fob battery replacement. Nothing I hadn't seen before, but they all had special lease prices on the window. $1900/month for an AMG GT seems kind of dear."
5,2017-03-25T19:14:50+00:00,tjc78,"Took the family to the Zoo today.   I saw at least 5 brand new Pilots.  No wonder they are terrible leases, no reason to give them away. "
6,2017-03-25T22:55:22+00:00,stickguy,"I think there are 3 of them at least in my neighborhood, 2 on my block. And see tons of them around.

also saw a nice steel blue MB GLA. Sharp looking in that color. I could be happy with something of that size and configuration."
7,2017-03-25T23:19:10+00:00,fintail,Local Bentley dealer has a fairly bright red Flying Spur sitting in a very visible part of their lot. I wonder who that's intended for.
8,2017-03-26T00:32:21+00:00,Michaell,Saw this at the dealer today:
9,2017-03-26T00:40:35+00:00,explorerx4,"So, did you buy it?"
10,2017-03-26T00:47:56+00:00,Michaell,"To small to live in - the sticker price was about 60% of the cost of my house.

And, that's where the wife would force me to be if I brought it home."
11,2017-03-26T18:57:05+00:00,PF_Flyer,"During our stay in Santa Monica for Edmunds meetings, this little gem was available for rent outside the hotel. We didn't, but the wife was thinking we should have"
12,2017-03-28T00:52:32+00:00,imidazol97,Just call it your doghouse for those times when it's best not to hang around the house!
13,2017-03-28T00:54:35+00:00,fintail,"On the road in traffic today was beside the CEO in his new Bentley, also saw a new E-class, seldom-seen luxury trim and looked like a high spec car with drivers assistance package. Terribly driven, embarrassing, distracted and phone usage. Time for progressive fines."
14,2017-03-28T01:24:54+00:00,tjc78,"Our CEO drives a 7 series. He could easily afford a Bentley but he just isn't the type.  I don't even think he picked the 7, his nephew who works for the company gets that job.  "
15,2017-03-28T01:31:56+00:00,fintail,"Our CEO also regularly drives a later model Ferrari, I think a 458. I am pretty sure he makes a cool 8 figures, so these cars for him are like you or I buying a $700 beater"
16,2017-03-28T15:54:54+00:00,andres3,"I have to laugh at ""not being the type"" for a Bentley, but a 7-Series is OK? If he's really not the type, a Lexus ES would do! Maybe even a Honda Accord V6.

If I didn't care for sport in my cars, I would probably be happy with luxury from Lexus. If I wanted a happy medium, Audi's A-cars are great.

I have a loaner right now. A ""loaded"" A3. 2.0T, quattro, Bang & Olufsen Stereo, DSG, parking sensors, blind spot light monitor. A nice small car that is comfortable and geared for good mileage. It's laughable how different it is geared (with the same 6-speed) vs. my TTS. About 1K difference in RPM at 75 MPH.

Softer sprung, but still fast in the curves. Only true sports cars would get away from this A3, yet it is comfy."
17,2017-03-28T17:01:49+00:00,stickguy,Add a sport package and that is my sons car. If it is a 2017.
18,2017-03-28T18:12:34+00:00,andres3,"I doubt it because it has nearly 13,000 miles. In fact, the key tag says '15 A3. Still, a quality car, that I know is even more improved for '17, and that's a good thing.

It has the drive SELECT (comfort, dynamic) and 19"" wheels, so I'm guessing it is a ""sport"" model.

Surprised they had parking sensors on the '15's, but it was a new model release at the time.

Main complaint: The interior isn't quite up to snuff by A4/S4/TT standards. In fact, I still feel the '06 A3 had some nicer materials and softer more padded plastics, with nicer trim real aluminum trim accents (sport models). However, the difference is slight and it is still a nice (though dark all-black) interior. It is quiet. It is tight."
19,2017-03-28T20:21:10+00:00,stickguy,"The 17 interior is updated I think. And he has cool virtual dash and nice sport seats.

Fun car, but small"
20,2017-03-28T21:00:38+00:00,andres3,"Doesn't he have the ""brown"" interior? I think pictures are justified. For sure, the '15 doesn't have virtual dash screen; it has the center dash pop-up IPAD-like screen."
21,2017-03-28T23:48:31+00:00,stickguy,"yes, he has the dark blue over chestnut. Gorgeous combo. premium package, tech/navi, and sport package. Very snazzy, and the virtual cockpit is way cool.

tough to find a twin (heck, it was super hard for him to find in the first place), but this is close. Only difference is his is cosmos blue not black, and he doesn't have LED lights. But the interior is the same!

22,2017-03-29T01:21:40+00:00,fintail,I saw a new CX-9 while on foot today. What caught my eye was the sharp looking (literally sharp) edge at the top of the grille/front of the hood. Seems kind of dangerous from the suddenly important pedestrian impact point of view.
23,2017-03-29T15:01:46+00:00,andres3,"I said ""Jesus"" when seeing the $44K sticker. I guess Audi doesn't need to under-cut the competition with price anymore."
24,2017-04-03T22:04:24+00:00,laurasdada,"ON the way to work this morn, a new black (rather dirty, maybe dark gray?) Miata RF. Coming up on it from the center lane, it was in the left, in 3/4 view the front fenders reminded me a bit of the C3 Vette. Tiny car, I felt like I was driving an Expediton when I pulled up next to it!

There was a white BMW X1 playing left lane bandit, so the Miata did a nice, quick slingshot around it (even used turn signals!), followed by a silver BMW 435GC and then my XF. A trio of good lookers (and good drivers)! If only I were as handsome as my car..."
25,2017-04-03T22:11:09+00:00,explorerx4,"I the parking lot at work, a red Jaguar XE.
In another parking lot, a Jaguar F Pace. It's only second one I've seen and it looked a lot better than the one I saw in Germany."
26,2017-04-04T02:31:54+00:00,qbrozen,"Saw a Continental on the Turnpike today. I still think it is a good looking car. Driver thought he was in a bimmer, though, based on how he was tailgating and swerving."
27,2017-04-04T03:25:37+00:00,stickguy,"I saw a continental on the garden state Saturday. Not bad looking. I think it had livery plates on it though, but not positive."
28,2017-04-04T16:42:42+00:00,laurasdada,"In mybuilding garage this morning, a very new and very red Alfa Giulia. Will investigate this evening! Wonder if it's a surprise gift for me?"
29,2017-04-04T21:52:58+00:00,explorerx4,"I saw a new Lincoln Continental the other day, now that I think of it.
Another F Pace today."
30,2017-04-05T00:02:41+00:00,tjc78,"I sat in one at the Auto Show. I wouldn't throw it out of my driveway, but I'm a fan of barges.  "
31,2017-04-06T01:02:06+00:00,fintail,Saw a new pointy nose CX5 on the road - I have to seriously wonder if the new pointed nose has pedestrian safety concerns. Seems iffy.
32,2017-04-06T01:50:02+00:00,stickguy,saw a new CX-9 in my neighborhood today with temp tags. Sharp looking. I think it is a replacement for a 5 or so YO caddy SRX but i didn't get a good look at the driver. Will eventually see it parked when I am out for a walk.
33,2017-04-06T02:42:28+00:00,berri,Wonder if he took a bath on the Caddy trade-in? Could have been worse I suppose if it was a Lincoln.
34,2017-04-06T03:12:54+00:00,stickguy,I was guessing on the year. Just know he has had it as long as I can remember. probably had it long enough that it didn't really matter.
35,2017-04-06T16:39:20+00:00,andres3,The new '17 A4 quattro I just picked up is most definitely longer and harder to park in a tight space than the little A3.
36,2017-04-06T16:49:17+00:00,stickguy,"When I sat in one in the showroom, it felt like a very big car to me. Much larger inside than the A3. I know it is longer and wider (not sure how much), but no clue if it drives as big as it feels from inside."
37,2017-04-06T17:08:38+00:00,andres3,"I'll be able to give a ""full"" report on the A4 flagship drive-ability after this upcoming weekend. I did have one before for just a brief drive and it definitely drove lighter and nimbler than it looks, which I agree, it looks and feels big when you sit inside. I heard it is just incrementally bigger than the previous A4, but it is significantly lighter."
38,2017-04-07T21:17:01+00:00,explorerx4,"A black and a white Mercedes GLC, and another F Pace."
39,2017-04-08T02:15:10+00:00,stickguy,"my neighbor seems to have traded in his MB GLK for a new GLC. Nice looking, but I realized that the profile looks a real lot like our RDX."
40,2017-04-08T03:03:57+00:00,kyfdx,"Yeah, I was behind a GLC, today. Very generic. Probably why it's so popular."
41,2017-04-08T03:11:28+00:00,stickguy,I am fine with simple but attractive exterior (as opposed to overwrought and tacky). At least the Benz makes up for it with a really nice interior!
42,2017-04-08T21:17:35+00:00,explorerx4,"Spring must be here, I spotted a Tesla Model S today."
43,2017-04-09T19:36:56+00:00,fintail,"Not new, but interesting in a way, I saw 2 current W205 C-class this morning, one a rental, one a dealer loaner.

The loaner was being used by the proprietor of the Chevron I patronize. His normal cars are a very low mileage 2012 IS-F, and a 3 year old GL. The GL had a strut failing, and needed engine mounts, so it gets to spend about a week in the shop. Kind of alarming for such a young vehicle."
44,2017-04-09T22:52:01+00:00,berri,Now I thought all those gas station owners pled poor man not making any money during the gas price run-ups
45,2017-04-10T00:42:00+00:00,fintail,"It might hurt their gas profit margins, but I think the money from snacks and the car wash keeps this one afloat

On the road today, a late model Aston."
46,2017-04-10T01:23:40+00:00,stickguy,another new CRV. really selling like hotcakes it seems.
47,2017-04-10T03:17:36+00:00,laurasdada,"Visited Bentley University with my son and ex. yesterday. Of course, we discussed the cost of college these days... Just as we were making a left onto the street that leads to the Bentley entrance, a (gorgeous!!!) black Aston Martin DB11 passed us going in the opposite direction. No doubt this was the car of the president of the University!"
48,2017-04-10T10:28:01+00:00,tjc78,Pilots and CRVs everywhere.....
49,2017-04-10T13:20:21+00:00,Michaell,"A few houses down from us live a brother, his sister and a friend. The brother drives a CR-V and the sister had an older Camry.

The sister picked up a new car to replace the Camry - yep, another CR-V (used, same vintage as her brothers)."
0,2017-04-10T14:00:47+00:00,texases,"Parked next to a Dawn this weekend, in an office parking lot on a Sunday. Wonder why it was there:"
1,2017-04-10T18:38:16+00:00,explorerx4,A new Raptor in white.
2,2017-04-10T21:23:30+00:00,andres3,"The B9 A4 makes for a very capable daily driver that gives you luxury and sport at the same time. It is a very capable car.

At the limits, the brakes will eventually overheat and fade a bit, and the OEM tires are not too happy once they get extremely hot. However, for 99.999% of drivers, this won't matter. I doubt A4 buyers will be tracking the A4, and if they do, I recommend brake pad and tire upgrades at a minimum.

93 MPH to hit 2,000 RPM in top gear (7th gear).

Cruise control can be set to 100 MPH and you'll get 26 to 27 MPG.

I personally prefer the interior layout, style, and quality of the B8 an B8.5 S4 more than this newer version in the A4. I feel like the materials quality is down a bit, and I'm not a fan of the I-Pad on the dash look, nor its functionality.

However, the car is definitely more balanced and lighter when pushed around turns."
3,2017-04-11T16:40:49+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Pardon me, but I think this car's front end design is hideous. Did they farm out the styling department to a kit car company?

Well. I'm sure the seats are nice."
4,2017-04-12T00:55:08+00:00,fintail,"Today: 2x newer style Audi R8 (one at work, someone is doing well), 2x BMW 7er - one a fancy Rolls-Royce Ghost variant (more revenge for 1945 ) , 2x new CRV."
5,2017-04-12T01:20:55+00:00,kyfdx,Nissan Murano Cross Cabrio.
6,2017-04-12T04:11:33+00:00,Michaell,"I was behind one over the weekend - with the top down.

They beat it with an ugly stick until that stick broke, then they got something worse.

But, in a strange way, I can sort of understand the concept here in Colorado - SUV with AWD for winter, top down fun in the summer.

What other cars can do that?

Audi Cabriolets - not much ground clearance
Jeep Wrangler - punishing ride

Murano CC offers the best of both worlds."
7,2017-04-12T12:13:35+00:00,laurasdada,"Well, Land Rover must have thought the Murano Cabrio a good idea as they now have one of their own: the Evoque convertible. Saw one from a distance yesterday."
8,2017-04-12T14:16:26+00:00,texases,Even more general - what other drop tops can comfortably fit 4 adults?
9,2017-04-12T14:53:45+00:00,kyfdx,Well... they are pretty famous for over-the-top ostentation (is that a word?).
10,2017-04-12T14:53:59+00:00,kyfdx,Mercedes S-Class?
11,2017-04-12T15:08:23+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Are you recovered yet?
12,2017-04-12T15:13:56+00:00,kyfdx,"Immediately afterward, a BMW i3 crossed in front of me, and looked like an Aston Martin, in comparison."
13,2017-04-12T15:26:14+00:00,texases,"I've seen a few more of the i3, but still looks goofy, to me. The new Bolt is much better, IMO:"
14,2017-04-12T15:30:33+00:00,kyfdx,The Bolt and Volt are decent looking vehicles.
15,2017-04-12T18:03:51+00:00,texases,"Two new ones: one rare, a Levante, one common, a Mustang GT. The thing with this (and many other) Mustangs was a TERRIBLE exhaust system. Loud, but not in any good way. Sounded like a couple of Civics with cheap 'fart can' mufflers. Obnoxious just keeping up with traffic. Why????"
16,2017-04-12T18:31:57+00:00,PF_Flyer,Some of the items that wind up on cars are head-scratchers for sure
17,2017-04-12T20:36:06+00:00,ab348,Sure it was a Mustang GT and not an Ecoboost 4-banger?
18,2017-04-12T20:38:05+00:00,texases,"It was a GT, said so right between the taillights! It was so loud, it made me wonder if the owner had removed the cats.

And it's not only Mustangs, a number of Challengers I come across have super loud exhausts, including one of my neighbors I'm surprised I see/hear so few Camaros with loud pipes."
19,2017-04-12T21:42:43+00:00,kyfdx,"I had a Challenger go past me on I-75.. Every 20 seconds or so, he would punch the throttle, even though there was no place to go.. vroom.. vroom, vroom.. did it about 20 times. Seems like that would get boring."
20,2017-04-13T00:58:24+00:00,explorerx4,Moved.
21,2017-04-13T01:05:04+00:00,stickguy,GM did a few of those. I think based on the Firebird. Though likely there was a Camaro variant too.
22,2017-04-13T01:05:47+00:00,fintail,Saw an AMG GT today.
23,2017-04-13T01:58:10+00:00,jpp75,I saw a Bolt today in San Francisco. I don't care for the looks of it personally.
24,2017-04-13T14:31:49+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,It's awkward-looking but not really offensive.
25,2017-04-13T14:34:21+00:00,jpp75,That's actually a perfect description.
26,2017-04-13T14:41:57+00:00,texases,Do folks prefer the looks of the Bolt or the i3?
27,2017-04-13T14:44:45+00:00,kyfdx,"I think the Bolt looks like a normal car.. The i3, not so much.

Not sure which I like less, though."
28,2017-04-13T15:05:59+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Just me personally, I'd feel like a dork driving an i3---like I was on a Segway or driving a Smart car wearing clothes from LL Bean. The Bolt is no beauty but it's a little more ""normal"" looking."
29,2017-04-13T18:31:17+00:00,laurasdada,"So, Mr._S, the Bolt, you ain't a beauty, but, hey, you're all right?"
30,2017-04-14T01:14:57+00:00,fintail,Saw a Bentayga on the road today. The perfect car if you live in France - in 1788.
31,2017-04-14T18:39:47+00:00,andres3,"Too bad Bugatti doesn't disclose how expensive it is to go 200+ MPH, and how quickly a tank of fuel disappears while doing that exercise."
32,2017-04-15T04:07:21+00:00,fintail,Saw another Bentayga today.
33,2017-04-15T18:08:55+00:00,PF_Flyer,"Driving along withe a Tesla Model S. First one I've seen here in central PA, and it was silver, first one I've seen that wasn't black"
34,2017-04-15T19:53:16+00:00,fintail,"Saw a red new E300 today, loaded with drivers assist and full LED gauges. The high option cars are uncommon, especially in an odd color."
35,2017-04-16T03:17:08+00:00,ab348,"In the showroom of the dealer where I bought my ATS, a 2017 Camaro 50th Anniversary edition priced at a cool $60K Cdn. Strangely for a 50th anniversary there is no gold anywhere I saw. Based on a SS convertible, it was metallic gray with a black convertible top and black interior, lots of special badges and embroidery. The option package is a $7400 option. Left me rather cold like all Camaros currently do."
36,2017-04-16T12:59:13+00:00,explorerx4,"A new Lacrosse on the way back from the airport. Not so sure about the grille, but the rest of it looks good."
37,2017-04-16T17:46:23+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"The Lacrosse gets pretty good reviews but if you pack it up with AWD, driver assist, special wheels and suspension, and all the comfort goodies, you can break the $50K barrier. Seems like the lower end is the better buy (only has one engine option)."
38,2017-04-16T21:55:57+00:00,ab348,I hear the bigger wheels/sport suspension on the Lacrosse really mess up the ride too.
39,2017-04-16T22:15:30+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yep, those 20"" wheels are going to hammer you."
40,2017-04-17T18:20:25+00:00,andres3,"Yesterday I saw a black VW Passat 3.6 SE. I have to think these big engine 3.6 V6 Passat's are even a lot more rare than a recent model V6 Accord.

I bet the 3.6 Passat is a compelling package at its price point, but greenies don't want V6's anymore."
41,2017-04-19T12:46:20+00:00,iluvmysephia1,"I spotted a 2017 Toyota Yaris iA in a muted, earthtone color, on 135th heading towards I-35 Olathe. I love that car! The gaping maw, in real life, just comes off as cute.

Great Mazda mechanicals. To get the automatic in this iA would be silly. Go for the manual, for sure for sure!"
42,2017-04-21T19:56:11+00:00,ab348,"On Wednesday I was at my GM dealer and got to sit in a new Camaro SS with the 50th Anniversary package. First time I sat in one of the current-gen Camaros and visibility is as bad as you hear. However even though the dash looks a lot like the previous-gen model, up close it looks a lot better with better materials and design. The seats in this one were a subtle 2-tone black and dark gray leather with red stitching. A bit too understated for my tastes but not awful. It was painted a dark metallic gray which again was understated but under the showroom lights all the angles and bodylines really made it look good.

They had another SS there in black, which didn't look as good to me on the outside, but which had red inserts in the seats and door panels. With a different exterior color that one might have been really handsome."
43,2017-04-22T02:27:34+00:00,berri,Visibility - how about the basics of getting in and out of it
44,2017-04-22T15:14:08+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well just plan your day so as to limit the number of times you have to exit. You could, for instance, only eat from drive-ins, use automatic car washes without having the interior cleaned, and I think Walgreen's has curbside service now. With a reclining seat and some necessities for nature's call, I don't see why you'd even have to leave that car for 24 hours."
45,2017-04-22T19:01:45+00:00,fintail,Saw an Alfa Giulia and a MB C43.
46,2017-04-23T10:43:54+00:00,stickguy,"A few new Ioniqs. Look sharp in person. I like them. also a couple new Tiquans. Look so much bigger than the old model (which makes sense, since it is!) but very attractive, classy styling. Sadly that sticks out now in a sea of overwrought, Japanese oragami styling."
47,2017-04-23T12:18:45+00:00,kyfdx,"The new Tiguan is out? Didn't know that, and I was at a VW dealership, last week."
48,2017-04-23T13:02:08+00:00,explorerx4,The local dealer VW had a big ad in the paper yesterday saying all 2015 diesels are on sale.
49,2017-04-23T13:16:04+00:00,kyfdx,"Yeah, that's why I was there, last week."
0,2017-04-23T17:53:24+00:00,kyfdx,Are you sure that wasn't the new Atlas?
1,2017-04-23T18:22:38+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,My friends went to check out one of those 2015 VW diesels--the pricing was RIDICULOUS. They passed. Apparently the wagons are a hot ticket item.
2,2017-04-23T18:41:14+00:00,Michaell,"There was an Atlas and the new Tiguan at the Denver Auto Show. The Tiguan is certainly bigger than the previous version, but the Atlas is the size of a Pilot or Explorer."
3,2017-04-23T18:59:35+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"From photos, the Atlas looks rather blah. Late to the game, I would say."
4,2017-04-23T20:24:26+00:00,stickguy,"Well, it was in Ireland, so I assume it just arrived there first. Pretty sure it was a Tiguan based on the size. An Atlas really would have looked out of place (being so huge)."
5,2017-04-23T20:39:36+00:00,kyfdx,"Ah... I thought of that, after I posted."
6,2017-04-26T01:13:54+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Bentayga today, let them eat cake."
7,2017-04-26T02:55:38+00:00,laurasdada,"Saw my first Bentayga in the wild, too. To each, but so many better ways to spend $200+k."
8,2017-04-26T16:15:58+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Did you read that Car and Driver article about the guy in the UK that has driven his Lamborghini Murciélago 250,000 miles? Total cost to get that far----$640,000 (including depreciation, gas@ $6 a gallon, insurance, an accident, track time, etc). Still, that does make one's socks roll up and down.....

I especially liked the cost of headlights---$7700 apiece, and total cost of feul @ $162,000."
9,2017-04-26T16:21:18+00:00,stickguy,"If he had bought a pedestrian car, say an S class MB, or big engined BMW coupe, would not have been that much lower."
10,2017-04-26T16:33:37+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"You mean like an S65 AMG or some such? Yeah, it's going to cost you a lot to get to 250,000 on one of those as well. Of course fuel in the USA is much cheaper than UK, so that will cut costs considerably, and I would hope that an MB or BMW is at least somewhat more reliable than a Lambo."
11,2017-04-26T16:36:59+00:00,fintail,"I think a W221 or newer S65 would be worlds better for high mileages than a W220S65. Maintenance will still be enormous, but it shouldn't have constant system failures."
12,2017-04-26T18:43:41+00:00,andres3,"There isn't much data on supercar reliability is there? CR only reports if they get enough responses, so I never do hear much about Lambo, Ferrari, or other such ultra-expensive sports cars.

Part of the problem is many of the owners probably don't daily drive them. I think the R8 was really the first daily drive-able supercar. I suppose there are some that did so with the Acura NSX.

I know of a couple people racking up major miles on their R8's; I'll have to ask them about any unexpected repairs outside of normal maintenance.

I do know they seem to be holding their value really well.

I think a statistic that tracks % of MSRP it typically takes to reach 250,000 miles would be a great data point for consumers. After all, even a $15,000 Corolla probably takes a fair percentage of its original MSRP to get there."
13,2017-04-26T19:04:55+00:00,fushigi,"The cheapest new Corolla is $21,665. It gets a city/highway combined of 30MPG so 8,333 gallons to drive a quarter million miles. At $2.50/gallon that's almost another $21K in fuel. BTW it only has a 13.2 gallon tank so assuming you used 90% of the tank before filling up you'd have 701 stops for fuel.

Add your other operating expenses & you'd be well over MSRP again in operating costs. Probably 5 sets of tires, numerous oil changes, a few brake jobs, etc."
14,2017-04-26T19:50:56+00:00,kyfdx,"At 250K miles, depreciation is 99%, no matter what the car. That's pretty brutal when you start out over $200K"
15,2017-04-26T20:43:53+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Unless it's a pickup truck, it seems. You can sell someone a pickup no matter how many miles on it."
16,2017-04-26T21:47:43+00:00,explorerx4,"In the parking lot at work, a white Honda Accord coupe and a Mercedes GLK.
The GLK has got to be one of the ugliest Mercedes ever designed, although there was that C class with the hatch that was no prize either."
17,2017-04-27T02:11:22+00:00,qbrozen,"I always liked the GLK design.

And certainly you are forgetting the current GLC coupe for the ugly Benz award."
18,2017-04-27T03:03:13+00:00,fintail,"GLK was at least unique, and had a Tonka like charm to it. GLC coupe is a BMW copy, and not in a good way. Kind of funny, as the normal GLC is also quite decent, somewhat close to a lifted C wagon."
19,2017-04-27T17:06:15+00:00,tifighter,"My wife loved the GLK. Especially in red. She still points them out on the road, and frowns on the GLC."
20,2017-04-28T01:04:09+00:00,fintail,"Saw a C cabrio on the road today, still pretty uncommon."
21,2017-04-29T20:00:55+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new E wagon at the MB dealer this morning, along with some usual exotica - S65 cabrio, AMG GT. Most amusing was a C-cabrio that stickered for 60K on the nose, not a penny more or less."
22,2017-04-29T20:06:57+00:00,laurasdada,"Haven't seen one, but apparently a Jaguar XF Shooting SportBrake is in the works! Bound for Los Estados Unidos?"
23,2017-04-30T17:12:12+00:00,kyfdx,"Mercedes AMG GT S.. with temporary tags.

Impressive looking. And, not as expensive as I would have guessed."
24,2017-04-30T17:25:09+00:00,fintail,"Not brand new, but I talked to the guy who lives in my building and has an F-Pace. He's very pleased with it, no issues."
25,2017-04-30T20:37:09+00:00,fintail,"I expected something a little more daring for the new Tesla pickup:



(joke from my brother, who parked his S10 at the newly installed charging stations in the small town where he lives. No doubt catering to travelers, I seriously doubt anyone who lives there drives a Tesla)."
26,2017-05-01T16:10:31+00:00,qbrozen,What we need is a video of the owner trying to insert the plug into his gas filler neck
27,2017-05-01T16:50:10+00:00,stickguy,"Another new pilot in my neighborhood. In the very common dark gray. Next door to someone else that bough one, but blue. There are at least 2 others in my neighborhood that I know of"
28,2017-05-01T17:39:51+00:00,andres3,"There's a E55 AMG on my street, but I didn't photo it. However, I did photo these Benz's:"
29,2017-05-01T17:51:33+00:00,fintail,"250SE cabrio would be model years 1966-68, I think. Fairly desirable car, I don't know about those grille badges, but probably just a well-loved car. The SL has side markers, so likely 1968+, probably a 280SL."
30,2017-05-01T17:52:14+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Good lord! Who tinted the windows? Well, easily corrected at least."
31,2017-05-01T18:09:57+00:00,ab348,"A 250SL that I really liked, a nice preserved but unrestored car (but as usual was picked to death by the aficionados) sold last week on BaT for $66K. Yikes."
32,2017-05-01T18:37:22+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"That's a risky purchase sight unseen. They are very rust-prone and a devil to put right. But top-notch show quality ones are in the 130K range now. Last year I saw the best one in the world, E-V-E-R, and it sold quickly at $145K and probably could be flipped for another $10K.

People will pay for the very best.

Personally I like the early 230SLs with manual transmission. Much closer to what we might call ""a sports car""."
33,2017-05-01T18:59:10+00:00,fintail,"I think I'd rather have the cabrio. It's basically a fintail, so I would be familiar with it, and it has a timeless class to it that few cars can match. Good solid long term values on those, too (where Pagodas have tripled in 20 years)."
34,2017-05-01T19:00:32+00:00,tifighter,I went to high school with a kid that had a 230SL with the 4 speed manual. White. Hand me down from the parents. Early nineties. Extra cringe-worthy now.
35,2017-05-01T19:03:33+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Which? The car or the kid?
36,2017-05-01T23:43:56+00:00,berri,I like that rather rich looking sort of cream color and it actually stands out as a MB. That's why I like Fin's Fintail too.
37,2017-05-02T01:11:58+00:00,fintail,A lot of earlier W113s were white on blue or white on red. White was big for MB then. I've seen an early 230SL in the same color as my fintail.
38,2017-05-04T16:29:38+00:00,laurasdada,"At the Acura dealer, on my ""Automile,"" a new, white NSX."
39,2017-05-13T01:17:54+00:00,fintail,"Saw a white NSX in traffic today, also a new silver C63"
40,2017-05-13T12:57:49+00:00,ab348,"Saw a Tesla Model X on the road yesterday, a first for me in these parts. Teslas are pretty thin on the ground here anyway but I have seen a few sedans over the last couple of years. I never knew they even made a SUV-type vehicle. Wasn't nearly as good-looking as the sedan to me, looked rather turtle-ish."
41,2017-05-13T18:38:11+00:00,fintail,"I call the Tesla design language ""egg"". I wish I didn't see so many of them, I probably see 10 Model X a day now. Worst use of private vehicle tax incentives ever."
42,2017-05-13T19:31:37+00:00,kyfdx,"Mercedes E550 convertible... in red, with the top down."
43,2017-05-15T15:42:46+00:00,andres3,"In strong competition for the Cash4Clunkers debacle I'm sure. Arguable which one was a greater waste. I'll go with your call only because at least the Cash4Clunkers horrible idea helped some of the masses in general, while Tesla's are aimed at the 1%. Maybe top 5% given the incentives."
44,2017-05-15T15:48:17+00:00,andres3,"Saw a large bunch of Dodge Viper ACR's at the local Cars N' Coffee Saturday. Apparently they have a Southern CA club. Audi made the strongest showing though, with RS7, RS4, S6, Allroad, A4, S3, A3, TT, and of course my TTS all represented.

The sponsoring ""car wrap"" company had one of those 200+ MPH Bugatti's being wrapped in a combo of blue and very reflective polished aluminum/chrome look."
45,2017-05-15T16:59:25+00:00,qbrozen,I wonder what happens to vinyl wrap at 200mph
46,2017-05-15T17:20:54+00:00,fintail,"The thing that gets me about C4C is that some nice old cars (quite a few MB 124/126/140, I think) were lost, but hopefully were parted out before they were crushed. It also inflated used car values, at least for a time.

The socio-economic part of the Tesla break is what I find cringeworthy, yes. How there is no MSRP cap is both amazing and not surprising at the same time."
47,2017-05-15T17:54:36+00:00,berri,Tesla and Tesla stock = Bubble???
48,2017-05-15T18:12:50+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Can't make sense out of Tesla---don't try.
49,2017-05-15T20:01:23+00:00,kyfdx,"I wouldn't bet against the stock. Not as long as they have no trouble raising all the money they need. Doesn't matter if you are right, if everyone else keeps buying."
0,2017-05-15T20:27:10+00:00,berri,Eventually someone gets caught holding the bubble before it bursts. But you can't time that and markets often don't seem to be rational.
1,2017-05-15T20:45:38+00:00,Michaell,"Not having done any research on this, Tesla to me seems similar to the internet bubble of the late 90's. Irrational market values for a company that hasn't turned a profit, and survives due to government largesse."
2,2017-05-15T21:00:55+00:00,ab348,I have to think a few of the top dogs at Tesla are having one heckuva good time these days.
3,2017-05-15T21:30:41+00:00,berri,"I think Tesla may have some cash flow issues, which if true can be dangerous."
4,2017-05-15T22:21:32+00:00,kyfdx,"They do burn a lot of cash.. but, so far, they have no problem selling more debt or equity in capital markets. So, no cash flow issues, per se.

I am amazed at the number of cars they've been able to produce and sell. How many people have started a car company in the last 50 years and sold even 20K vehicles?"
5,2017-05-15T22:32:58+00:00,andres3,"How many companies have crashed and burned in just the last 17 years trying to make cars for a living?

I know GM was forced to close down a few brands in 2008/2009."
6,2017-05-15T22:39:03+00:00,texases,"It seems like Tesla's hope for long term survival is large sales of the upcoming Tesla 3. But now everyone's trying to get into that niche ($35k, 200+ miles range). Given Tesla's poor quality record on the X (especially), I'd much rather buy an EV from a known brand that I can bet will be around years hence."
7,2017-05-15T22:40:05+00:00,kyfdx,"I wouldn't buy a Tesla or invest in the stock.

But, I wouldn't short it, either."
8,2017-05-16T01:19:50+00:00,fintail,"Saw my first Lexus LC on the road today, kind of striking from some angles, but the front is still ghastly to me. Just like a Tesla, not how I'd blow through 100K."
9,2017-05-16T15:34:45+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Cant' think of one that started 1967 on up and reached that production level. Delorean never made it to 20,000, nor did Bricklin. In the 1950s, there were certainly new car companies that exceeded 20,000, like Lotus and Subaru."
10,2017-05-16T15:35:38+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,I read somewhere that about 25% of shareholders are holding short.
11,2017-05-16T17:14:34+00:00,kyfdx,"Funny about shorts.. I heard on CNBC that so many Sears (SHLD) shares were shorted, that some of the shares would have to be borrowed from ESL and Fairholme, that together own over 50% of the company.

When the stock starts up, all that short covering sometimes exaggerates the move upward. It's a dangerous game."
12,2017-05-26T15:24:10+00:00,fintail,"I wonder if the perpetual motion machine mouth of inaccuracies of 45 will impact the new cars we see

Hopefully not. Unbelievable."
13,2017-05-26T17:05:11+00:00,berri,"Hey, from the video coverage of the trip, maybe the issue is that the old man ain't getting any"
14,2017-05-26T17:18:24+00:00,fintail,"Not even that inherited fortune might be enough anymore.

Not many new Chevies in Germany, but plenty of Fords and Opels, and American made German brands. Hmmm"
15,2017-05-26T18:40:22+00:00,ab348,"Geez, I come here to get away from the constant barrage about Trump online elsewhere...."
16,2017-05-26T18:45:44+00:00,kyfdx,"Good point..

Let's can the political talk, or you'll be sentenced to watching cable news for the rest of the weekend."
17,2017-05-26T18:49:57+00:00,fintail,"I'd say it is potentially relevant to the auto market, especially upcoming models, but if those who shall not be offended are offended, then I'll refrain with unpleasant realities"
18,2017-05-26T18:58:05+00:00,kyfdx,Thanks..
19,2017-05-26T19:03:50+00:00,stickguy,stopped at Volvo dealer with my daughter today. Played with an S90. She was in love with the giant iPad center screen. Was really quite cool.
20,2017-05-26T19:21:11+00:00,qbrozen,Very very expensive way to obtain an ipad. ;b
21,2017-05-27T00:19:57+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new hockey stick 5er in traffic today, another product made by an industrial sector that produces material strongly desired by nearly every market"
22,2017-05-27T13:42:29+00:00,Michaell,"I spotted a new Lexus LC500 last week. Very menacing looking, even in white. "
23,2017-05-27T16:27:45+00:00,tlong,I concur about the current Lexus styling (especially front) to be ghastly. I never thought I'd long for the days of bland Lexi.
24,2017-05-27T18:45:05+00:00,fintail,"LC doesn't irk me form the side, but the front is a bit flamboyant for my taste."
25,2017-05-27T20:23:56+00:00,explorerx4,"Next door in the driveway. A sliver 3 series coupe, pretty sure an M3(badge on the front fender?).
Looks really good, but nothing over the top about the styling.
It has some kind of wording on the rocker area just ahead of the rear wheels."
26,2017-05-28T01:43:01+00:00,kyfdx,"I bet it's a regular 3-Series with ""performance"" parts. That's where I've seen that lettering.

M3s have louvered grills on the fenders."
27,2017-05-28T14:27:34+00:00,texases,And a coupe would be an M4 if new. 
28,2017-05-28T21:57:53+00:00,fintail,"Took a quick stop at the MB dealer today to see if there was anything odd. Not much, but did see an AMG GT roadster, cool car. Also a couple S cabrios. Used section had maybe 20 more basic spec 2016 C-class, retired loaners or maybe off lease/ex rental. Kind of an odd pile, so many of them. Oddball on the used lot was a 2004 SL600 in Mars Red.

Porsche dealer had a Boxster at almost 100K, gotta love the options."
29,2017-06-01T14:58:01+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Porsche is masterful at the Options List.
30,2017-06-01T17:57:29+00:00,ab348,"In traffic today, carrying two older ladies turning into a shopping mall, a new M-B C450 with AMG badges. Not sure what is under the hood since I can't actually find it on M-B Canada's site. Probably safe to assume that throttle pedal has never been opened beyond about 10%."
31,2017-06-01T18:14:39+00:00,fintail,"I think C450 is a 2016-only model car, now replaced by the C43. MB has become a little schizo with their naming. It's a TT V6 with ~360hp, and has some AMG bits."
32,2017-06-02T01:08:30+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new style Rolls-Royce coupe today, black and silver. I hope it wasn't brand new (it was unplated), as the black paint had swirl marks."
33,2017-06-02T15:48:58+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Maserati whizzed past me...I have a bit of trouble differentiating the new models...but I sure wish my car sounded like that, instead of like a can of angry gnats."
34,2017-06-02T16:02:08+00:00,Michaell,"@jpp5862 and I visited the Fiat / Alfa / Maserati dealer a few months back. GM fired up the Levante (SUV) in the showroom and demonstrated the two stage exhaust. Normal sounds pretty good, but the 'sport' mode (or whatever they called it) was simply amazing.

Would scare all the other mommy-bloggers that are in line to pick up the kids from the private school."
35,2017-06-02T17:34:16+00:00,andres3,"Saw a new-looking 911 with a big wing and the personalized plate reading ""SLOW911"" I had to smile, as I noticed the internal cross bracing roll cage and Recaro Racing seats. I wonder who has ""FAST911"" on their plate."
36,2017-06-02T18:52:49+00:00,ab348,Maseratis these days have the best exhaust note around. Not so sure about the rest of the car though.
37,2017-06-02T19:00:55+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"They should charge $80,000 for the exhaust system and give you the car for free."
38,2017-06-02T19:15:11+00:00,fintail,"I thought that was the point - you're buying a powertrain. I don't know if they have the best image though, the noise seems to bring out the worst in people. Nothing worse than a late model GT revving and weaving in and out of traffic, without signal of course,"
39,2017-06-03T17:01:08+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I sort of expect them to behave that way. If I see a Prius doing that, then I'm really frightened."
40,2017-06-06T01:20:52+00:00,fintail,"Saw a white Atlas on the road today, it is big and butch, should attract the target demographic for it. Also not brand new but current: S65 AMG, C63 AMG, and I think a C43 AMG."
41,2017-06-06T16:38:49+00:00,andres3,What's with all the AMG's in Seattle? I guess you need the HP to pass all those rolling blockades of Prius you mention all the time.
42,2017-06-06T17:14:11+00:00,fintail,"Lots of idle money, and some local demographics who want the most expensive version of any model, no matter what it is. Seems kind of sad for a tuned V12 to idle between lights while going from the gallery mall to the Whole Foods."
43,2017-06-06T21:21:27+00:00,andres3,I think it would be a more disturbing offense if one of those dawdling on-ramp mergerers was an AMG model that couldn't find it in their skill set to be going more than 40 MPH at the top of the on-ramp.
44,2017-06-07T01:48:14+00:00,fintail,"I never really see that, it's the hybrid and Lexus crowd who dawdles on on-ramps - which amuses me, as many Lexus may be somewhat dull, but not really underpowered. The tuned models are often driven with a degree of oblivion, probably because the drivers know they are untouchable on a socio-economic basis.

Saw a facelift SL on the road today"
45,2017-06-08T01:37:23+00:00,stickguy,New body style MB C43 AMG. Looked good in white.
46,2017-06-08T01:46:31+00:00,fintail,"On the same note, I got behind a C63S AMG convertible today. Black wheels not in good taste IMO, and the driver was more concerned about their hair than driving, given their no-signal lane change. Welcome to Bellevue!"
47,2017-06-09T00:58:13+00:00,explorerx4,"In the parking lot at work, a doppelganger to my Fusion, but has the 2.0 engine."
48,2017-06-12T01:59:26+00:00,stickguy,"not sure how new both were, but at Shop Rite today, it was M day. Parked near each other, an M4 convertible (dark gray over light gray, gorgeous), and an M6 convertible (white over red, also attractive).

I know all about the real people not actors awards that Chevy wins though. Great initial quality; meaning it isn't junk already when it leaves the factory floor.

Jaguar and Alfa seem to have a lot of commercials on TV lately."

In Europe it is more colorful, and in the 70's here it was more groovy."
35,2017-07-06T16:53:47+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Scary depreciation on those Maybachs---you can pick one up now for a fraction of MSRP.
36,2017-07-06T17:27:46+00:00,fintail,"I'd expect the current one to depreciate like an S-class, which means quickly. This is the new Maybach, only on the road for about a year or so here, which is more of a submodel of the S600, and has a distinct black money air to it. The prior Maybach 57/62 was a MB W220 with thrice the complexity and 4x the price. They remain surprisingly expensive on the used market given their insane running costs and now-dated styling."
37,2017-07-06T17:31:01+00:00,fintail,"For German cars in this market, black and white are typically the ""free"" colors, with others commanding a slight surcharge. I think some other makers do that too. Beigegrey is perfect for the Camrollaruis driver, and the makers know it. Non-enthusiasts don't complain about the dearth of color options - if they did, things would change.

Inexpensive cars in Europe seem to be more prone to reds, yellows, and similar than here."
38,2017-07-06T18:24:07+00:00,tlong,"But some makes even charge for things like pearl white. Sort of like the airlines, give some minimum base and then monetize as many extras as possible. BMW has been the king of that for many years."
39,2017-07-06T19:49:36+00:00,fintail,"Pearl white must be difficult to apply - MB doesn't just charge a premium for it, but often double the premium for a normal optional color. Germans know how to play the option profit margin game. I think Porsche is the winner, where it is not unknown for a car to have options approaching the base MSRP."
40,2017-07-06T19:58:06+00:00,texases,"Anything other than straight regular paint (no pearl, no metallic) often gets a premium added."

44,2017-07-07T01:45:30+00:00,fintail,"New one, at half the price, seems to be selling at more than twice the rate of the old one. Maybe some different economic realities between 2004 and today, and the lower price helps too. It's more of a niche now, a superdeluxe S600. I doubt many buyers know anything about the name."
45,2017-07-07T16:28:27+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yep, it's ""only"" $189,000 now. It's a lavish version of the S600, and I think stretched out a bit---even at that price, seems a screaming bargain next to a Rolls Phantom."
46,2017-07-07T20:06:29+00:00,fintail,"I think that's one area where Maybach models and S-class coupe are playing now - it's like 80% of a Bentley or Rolls-Royce for half or less of the cost.

Heck, the Maybach is cheap even compared to the oh so basic Ghost, which itself shares more than a couple bits with the F01 7er."

It was painted a sparkly metallic gray with a hint of blue, which may have had something to do with that. It seems to be getting decent reviews. The one I saw had the 235HP Turbo 4, which doesn't seem a lot to push around a 4000lb vehicle, but I assume it's more than adequate."

I'm sort of jealous. I like the the mechanical rear wing on my TTS to the bigger fixed wing on the TTRS. I like my rear bumper and exhaust layout/diffuser more too. Front ends looks are a tie in my opinion. However, the TTRS gets 25% more cylinders and size, with 33% more power (stock), probably only about 15-20% heavier engine too; so great numbers. Most importantly, I do believe it still gets an adjustable suspension to match mine, but also adds a tall 7th gear to the DSG transmission (mine only has a measly 6; small weight benefit though) to make it the superior daily driver down a high speed freeway. Of course, all these things are not free."
19,2017-07-13T17:08:58+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Is your engine really wound up at highway speeds?
20,2017-07-13T17:16:26+00:00,texases,That C-HR is a mess! And think of the (lack of) visibility to the rear. Add on the small room inside resulting from the 'styling'. Next best thing to a Juke.

24,2017-07-13T17:34:02+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,That is a bit tight for your type of car. Even the little 1.6L Mini is only turning 3000 rpm at 72 mph.
25,2017-07-13T18:16:45+00:00,fintail,"Don't let overdone bad styling become normal over time. If it was bad then, it is bad even if you get used to it. Now we just have slashes and faux aggression to mask the beige. I still like how the C-HR isn't just a fake off-roader like a CUV, it is a fake CUV. And the demographic will eat it up.

TTRS doesn't have standard turn signals, right? I am certain A/S/RS5 models don't include them"

May not be a big deal in reality, but I'm curious given the increase in crossover sales because among several factors, new car buyers like a higher seating position."
37,2017-07-14T19:14:06+00:00,fushigi,"What's the square in the middle of the front end below the bumper? Really detracts in the photos for me, though I'm sure it probably won't so much in person.

I really don't like screens that look like they pop up. Just seems like it was tacked on at the last moment. Obviously it wasn't but that kind of placement makes it look like it was. And there doesn't look to be any glare shielding.

Power numbers seem fine; being a little lighter should make up for the loss in HP in the 2.0t. But a 10 speed transmission? I can't imagine the gear hunting it might do. Why not just go CVT at that point?

Does anyone else wonder if dealers will stock all 15 trims?"
38,2017-07-14T19:31:24+00:00,stickguy,"Hard to tell about that square, but it could be for mounting a license plate, or something to do with the Honda Sensing features. Though that could be a problem, once you mount a front plate. Hard to tell how open the lower grill is. If totally, could be an issue. They had that problem on the 2005 vintage Odyssey for a few years, and condensers were taking a lot of rock hits. there was a whole DIY series floating around for adding mesh to protect the components.

I always need to see a car in person to really tell about these little details."

With all these improvements, it is amazing to me the majority of Corollas weren't equipped this way."

3,2017-07-20T02:34:52+00:00,fintail,Saw a new fancy suspension high-riding G-Wagen today.
4,2017-07-21T21:37:47+00:00,texases,"Saw what looked like a near-new 911 Turbo S roadster. Starts at $200k, so after options, what, about $300k?"
5,2017-07-21T22:22:24+00:00,andres3,"Audi dealership sales people are reporting that, yes, they are adding ADM to the sticker of new TTRS reaching lots these days. Some are reporting $8K over MSRP. I'm of the firm opinion MSRP is the highest price to pay for a car."
6,2017-07-23T01:53:25+00:00,kyfdx,"Spotted my first Focus RS, today"
7,2017-07-23T04:48:08+00:00,Michaell,"I spotted one in the wild today, as well. Passed me doing about 85+ on I-25 northbound."
8,2017-07-23T10:35:27+00:00,tjc78,"In Diamond Beach NJ... seeing lots of new iron. 3 Teslas (1 Sedan, 2 of the SUV looking thing).   The highest concentration of Yukon Denalis anywhere, I swear there must be at least 6-8 in eyesight.  Parked next to temp tagged black on black Explorer Sport.   Sharp.  "
9,2017-07-23T11:57:44+00:00,iluvmysephia1,"I saw a jet black Tesla S sedan yesterday in Leawood, KS."
10,2017-07-24T17:39:20+00:00,andres3,"I saw a brighter red Tesla S P70. Tesla's are almost a dime a dozen down here. I've seen several Focus RS' too.

Golf R and Focus RS are pretty rare though, but not quite as rare as a TTS/TTRS."
11,2017-07-26T02:26:26+00:00,fintail,"New white Rolls-Royce cabrio today, driven by a somewhat older guy in an amusingly blue suit jacket. It was likely the same one I saw a few weeks ago. Belle Epoque.

I'd need about hands to count the Teslas I see every day. Such a bold daring individualist choice."
12,2017-07-26T15:06:30+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"""Let's all be different together""."
13,2017-07-26T15:40:20+00:00,andres3,"On the positive side I don't see Tesla vehicles merging on the freeway at 45 MPH, or camping out in the left lane at the speed limit or less as much as Prius owners seem to do.

I also saw someone using one at the local 1/8 mile drag strip; which is perfect for a Tesla's strengths."
14,2017-07-26T15:46:22+00:00,texases,"Seems like BMW, MB, and Audi are leading the 'same design, different size' approach. I have to squint to tell a 340i from a 540i..."
15,2017-07-26T15:50:02+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,I like Teslas. I just don't want to be subsidizing someone who pays $100K for one.
16,2017-07-27T01:16:05+00:00,fintail,"Saw a TTS today, and my second C-HR, which is less offensive in person as the ones I have seen have been dull colors. I notice the ad copy for that sculpture of aggressive beige is as filled with hyperbole and almost snarky exaggeration as every other Toyota ad."
17,2017-07-27T01:20:07+00:00,ab348,"I saw a C-HR today also, painted red except for the roof panel, which was white. It almost looked like a circus vehicle."
18,2017-07-27T01:39:59+00:00,fintail,The one I saw today was solid white. It blended in with all of the other overstyled CUVs on the road.
19,2017-07-29T01:18:46+00:00,texases,"Saw an AMG C63s, matt grey with yellow stripes. I'm not a fan of getting the most expensive version of the cheapest model. What'd they go for? $100k?"
20,2017-07-29T01:33:14+00:00,fintail,"C63s base price is 75K. Of course, everything is optional, but nobody pays MSRP.

For reference, my old 1998 C43 AMG had a MSRP around 53K."
21,2017-07-29T01:55:00+00:00,qbrozen,"Really? So you aren't a fan of the M3? The S3? Civic R? 

Technically, the C isn't the lowest, nor is the 3-series, but you get where I'm going here."

23,2017-07-29T02:15:55+00:00,texases,"That C63s is based on a pretty weak starting point, then overdone. Big V8 in a small coupe is overdoing it. The M3 is a highly developed version of a good starting point. The V8 Audis in small bodies were overkill, too, in my opinion. "
24,2017-07-29T02:52:25+00:00,qbrozen,"I couldn't disagree more. But to each his/her own.

Apart from that, I saw a new c300 coupe the other night. Good looking car."
25,2017-07-29T03:01:56+00:00,fintail,"I don't think it is a weak basis either. For something like that, you are really paying for the engine/suspension tuning and badge more than the basis car, anyway.

Upcoming facelifted E coupe also looks impressive."
26,2017-07-29T10:48:07+00:00,kyfdx,"Saw my first C300 coupe, as well."
27,2017-07-30T20:59:50+00:00,ab348,"Came across an Audi R8 Spyder in traffic downtown today. Over $200KCDN, someone here is doing well. Nice toy certainly."
28,2017-07-30T21:21:51+00:00,stickguy,a dark blue CRV. Good color for the tail end styling
29,2017-07-30T21:45:29+00:00,ab348,"Yes, dark colors really make that chrome trim bar below the back window pop."
30,2017-07-31T01:48:42+00:00,tlong,"There's a Mclaren in orange/black that goes to my gym, I've seen it a few times. Very beautiful car and color. Not sure which model, I will have to look harder next time, as well as take a picture. Recently for the first time I saw the driver arrive in it, he was fairly young, probably not over 40. And I didn't realize the doors are sort of gull wing but hinge at the front rather than the top, so open more upward and forward."
31,2017-08-01T01:58:45+00:00,stickguy,a new looking acura RLX. In the wild. Nice champagne color. Good looking car. certainly rare.
32,2017-08-01T02:05:07+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,New Infiniti Q60----just like the automotive press has been saying--it might be Infiniti's best looking car yet.
33,2017-08-01T20:44:21+00:00,explorerx4,"A green Nissan Rogue Sport, first one I have seen."
34,2017-08-01T20:53:13+00:00,ab348,"Up here they are going with the name for that used in other markets, ""Qashqai"". The TV ads for it make the name sound like ""cash cow""."
35,2017-08-01T21:05:23+00:00,texases,Qwat?
36,2017-08-02T01:16:37+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new C-class cabrio on the road, white, top down."
37,2017-08-04T16:28:26+00:00,tlong,"A Prius Prime in a parking lot. My son pointed it out. Heck, I didn't even know about that model! Looks better than the regular Prius. Unusual curvature of rear end and rear window."
38,2017-08-04T17:59:42+00:00,stickguy,Sat in a new Camry. Noticeable change from the old model. Also sat in 2018 sonata. Not very noticeable changes.
39,2017-08-06T22:19:23+00:00,fintail,"Went for a short walk, saw a new Camry parked on the street, my first sighting in the wild. Rental spec LE - literally, it was a rental, with ACRISS barcodes on both rear door windows, and a ""learn more"" QR code sticker. Interestingly, it was a Japan-built car."
40,2017-08-06T22:23:56+00:00,berri,"I'm surprised they sent any of these early ones to the rental fleets. Wonder if it is for feedback since they tend to mile up quicker? The Pacific coast will often get Japan built vehicles, but I guess I didn't know the Camry was built there any longer. Kind of big dimensions for many countries. Although I suppose they sell in the Mideast and parts of Europe. The latter would be cheaper shipping wise from the States, but probably capacity limited at NA plants."
41,2017-08-06T23:38:59+00:00,ab348,I read an article that said retooling the main US Toyota factory to produce the new model is a very involved process. Not sure why it would be more complex than any other manufacturer but that was the reason the early models are coming from Japan. That surprised me for the same reasons you cited - I assumed Camry was mostly a N.A. model.
42,2017-08-07T00:43:33+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, NA likes big somewhat dull things with trunks. Via dashcam videos I see Camrys in Oz and Russia, neither of which surprise me, so there might be demand enough for some other production. I noticed the Japan link through the VIN on the barcode, and double checked it with the VIN near the A-pillar. For all I know, there could be some trickery where the ""J"" VIN doesn't mean made in Japan. I was surprised to see it in rental use so quickly, although as was said, it would be a good real world testbed."
43,2017-08-08T01:14:50+00:00,fintail,"Today spotted a C63 convertible, and not new but rare - a Q70 LWB, the answer to a question asked by nobody on this continent, and probably neck and neck with the RLX in sales."
44,2017-08-08T01:23:13+00:00,tjc78,"I've seen an RLX at least, the Infiniti if I did I didn't realize it "
45,2017-08-08T01:42:14+00:00,stickguy,"I saw a current style RLX a few days ago, in the wild. Not a bad looking car. Not my thing though."
46,2017-08-08T02:41:30+00:00,fintail,"4:3 Accord at 2:1 the price and it doesn't sell - shocked, I tell ya!

Re: the Infiniti, it is subtle but noticeable, reminds me of a Dachshund or centipede."
47,2017-08-08T02:44:31+00:00,stickguy,didn't say it was a good value. Just that I found it attractive looking. comfy seats too.
48,2017-08-08T03:15:48+00:00,fintail,"It might make a decent used value, if they hit the real market and aren't all expensive lease returns. The late 00s era RL seems like some bang for the buck."
49,2017-08-08T03:41:43+00:00,Michaell,"I spotted ""the"" ZDX last weekend."
0,2017-08-08T16:51:03+00:00,andres3,Haven't seen the new TLX-A-Spec in the wild yet. Production or sales issues?
1,2017-08-08T20:41:02+00:00,explorerx4,A targa top MX 5(Miata).
2,2017-08-09T01:10:56+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Giulia today, dark blue, small looking wheels so probably not a QF. Also a Levante."
3,2017-08-12T23:50:37+00:00,fintail,"CT6E - didn't just spot it, but rode in it. A friend of mine spotted a somewhat decent lease offer on this rare bird, and wanted to take a test drive. I went with him.

Pros:
Nice build and material quality. I spotted no assembly issues. This is the kind of Made in China car you want, as QC will be thorough.
Lots of tech and gadgetry. The camera mirror doesn't fail to be cool, and with HUD, night vision, nannies, etc, it can be fun to play with. Also more USBs than I have ever seen in a car.
Extremely smooth and quiet for something with a turbo 4 assist. We took it out with an empty battery, so always using the engine, and it was barely perceptible. I have to imagine it can be eerily silent in EV mode.
Lines softened since the ""art and science"" days look nicer, and should age better.

Cons:
High price, and junky ADM. The local dealer slaps an additional sticker on most of its cars, for nitrogen filled tires, door edge guards, etc, - 5K in many cases. Funny I don't see those shenanigans at the Audi/BMW/MB dealer. Old habits.
Low availability - the one we looked at was claimed to be the only E model in the area. It was black, which my friend doesn't want, and also makes it look like a livery color.

He didn't sit down and deal, as his Lincoln lease isn't all the way up, and he doesn't want to commit yet. He says the Lincoln dealer says they will give him a very good deal on an 18 MKZ, so he is waiting."
4,2017-08-13T01:22:49+00:00,qbrozen,"He should probably compare the CT6 to the Continental.

I saw my first Alfa Giulia today. It is in a neighbors driveway but could not see which model. It does have a flat black hood for some reason."
5,2017-08-13T01:25:28+00:00,berri,"If a dealer is slapping all kinds of ADM and other tricks on the car, move on!"
6,2017-08-13T02:41:06+00:00,fintail,"My friend wants something with hybrid or EV tech, so the Continental doesn't work for him. He's happy with the MKZ, other than the drone of the gasoline engine.

I agree on the ADM thing, cheesy."
7,2017-08-13T15:55:24+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,I've only seen two on a quick glance. Haven't studied one just sitting there. The front end styling is very aggressive.
8,2017-08-13T17:32:34+00:00,berri,Yesterday's Wall Street Journal had an article on the new (or at least heavily revised) Honda Odyssey. What I found interesting was that it said the 10 speed transmission allowed it to cruise at Interstate speeds at only around 2250 on the tach. What I found amusing was way back when we had kids at home or in college I owned a 2004 Ody with a 5 speed transmission. It cruised on the Interstate at around 2250 rpm. So what is the point of the added complexity???
9,2017-08-13T18:24:41+00:00,stickguy,"Fewer dead zones I guess. But I suspect that is 80+. So I like their highways.

I saw a brand new one yesterday. In black. Looked exactly like a hearse, complete with an accent line that resembled a landau bar.

It was awful."
10,2017-08-14T01:33:41+00:00,fintail,"At the local MBCA show today, a local dealer had the updated 18 E400 coupe on display. Nice car. 77K MSRP (quite loaded):



Kind of a mini S-class coupe now"
11,2017-08-14T01:41:45+00:00,qbrozen,"Only partially related, but C&D has a comparison of the new Odyssey vs the Sienna vs the Pacifica. The Pacifica won and the Toyota was last."
12,2017-08-14T01:47:50+00:00,stickguy,most of the coupes out these days just don't do anything for me. I suspect there is little chance I end up with any kind of 2 door car.
13,2017-08-14T02:43:18+00:00,berri,"Only partially related, but C&D has a comparison of the new Odyssey vs the Sienna vs the Pacifica. The Pacifica won and the Toyota was last

I can see that based on driving a new minivan. But I think that ranking would flip after around 5 years.

I saw a brand new one yesterday. In black. Looked exactly like a hearse, complete with an accent line that resembled a landau bar.

I have a problem getting into the Ody exterior too. What is more troubling to me is that the interior, including the past comfortable seating position and seats seem to have taken a step backwards."
14,2017-08-14T02:46:47+00:00,berri,"I'm not sure on that MB coupe Fin. I think I'd have to see it in person to really decide. That, what appears to be a rear side vent window, makes me think a bit modern day 49 Ford 2dr sedan in the greenhouse."
15,2017-08-14T03:34:18+00:00,fintail,"It's a true hardtop, but I think the angle of the window and the space below might not allow the entire window to roll down, so there's a soft pillar to divide it. The rear glass section is fixed, as far as I know."
16,2017-08-14T12:25:29+00:00,ab348,The previous model had a similar detail.
17,2017-08-14T13:35:08+00:00,qbrozen,"Other than the larger-than-life emblem, I dig it."
18,2017-08-14T13:53:23+00:00,texases,Aren't the MB coupes the only 'hardtops' out there? No 'B' pillar?
19,2017-08-14T14:01:42+00:00,qbrozen,good question. i think you may be correct.
20,2017-08-14T15:37:38+00:00,fintail,"Rolls-Royce Wraith and Bentley Continental are also true hardtops.

MB has had at least one hardtop in the range since the 1961 model year."
21,2017-08-14T17:13:40+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I had the same thought when I saw the first all black one. I would imagine a modern Addams Family would drive around in it. Apparently I'm not the only one to make the connection:

The ad says: ""A minivan for your weird family""."

23,2017-08-15T13:20:27+00:00,fintail,"Looks like some new cars are easier to total than others

Shame, local black money will have to find other cars. Knowing local contemptible judges, bail was set at $5 or $5MM."
24,2017-08-15T21:48:00+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"That's a class B felony. Not going to be so easy to skate on that one. Carries a max of 10 years + $20,000 fine."

26,2017-08-16T01:29:22+00:00,berri,"Heck, that guy won't spend much time in the slammer. The gov doesn't want to pay for the room and board, let alone his psychiatric treatment. Now if this happened across the lake in Seattle, the guy would be a victim and they would be going after the dealership for having an attractive nuisance"
27,2017-08-16T03:37:20+00:00,fintail,"Funny, Seattle doesn't have a dealer for those makes - although it is the largest regional city, all of the money isn't there. Little in the way of mental health services either, of course, because that would be socialist, un-American, etc.

And even with its faults, thousands of skilled intelligent productive people continue to move to Seattle (and here) each month."
28,2017-08-16T17:53:07+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"All the more reason he's going to jail--he didn't kill someone, he did something far worse in an oligarchy--he destroyed private property!"
29,2017-08-16T18:25:02+00:00,fintail,"Mental health might be the get out of jail free card in this case, and this is a somewhat more developed-world type of location. And financially, you can't get blood out of a turnip"
30,2017-08-16T20:00:48+00:00,berri,"Honestly, states and cities are budget strained, so jail sentences, parole and the like factor economics into their decisions. Not unusual to get a tough appearing sentence and then be out of jail way earlier. The whole judge sentencing thing has become a bit of a fraud at times."
31,2017-08-16T21:34:30+00:00,andres3,"I thought we were at full nearly 100% employment? How can Cities and States still be ""budget"" strained?

How is it when I call the CA Franchise Tax Board (FTB) on Monday morning they have the technology to put you in the que for a call back (after wasting 5 minutes going through the maze of menu selections for the automated telephone answering system), but the wait or call back time is 3 hours!

Get disconnected before they confirm your phone number again? No call back. Try again. Call at 3 PM because the website says the waiting time for a call back is down to 1 hour 11 minutes, and they don't close until 5 PM.

Machine says ""Due to volume of phone calls, you are screwed, and we don't give a damn.""

OK, I paraphrased, it said that you should call back another time. As if they had long hours to begin with, or were available weekends! Last time it was so hard to reach an entity that wanted to get paid money, it was the Municipal Courts (Traffic Courts). They've also pulled the ""we are getting too many calls, so were not answering the phone anymore during our business hours"" message routine."
32,2017-08-16T21:36:23+00:00,fintail,"And so much of it is the courts and LEOs being mental health officers, since we started regressing on the social goods front about 35 years ago.

I've always found ""contempt of court"" to be a funny kangaroo court style charge, as contempt should be a natural reaction if one is paying attention."
33,2017-08-16T21:53:58+00:00,andres3,"In traffic court I tend to feel only two things:

1) Contempt for the whole charade parading and pretending to be ""justice.""

2) Intimidation from the formality of it all, the experienced opposition/prosecution/officer, and the tendency for the judge to take on the role of Prosecutor since there is no DA in traffic court.

When in court I try to hide my contempt as best I can, but probably some of it oozes out in my demeanor, body language, tone of voice, and hence, maybe/probably that's why some judges have really handed it to me!"
34,2017-08-16T22:20:32+00:00,fintail,"Why not? When you effectively know it all, and effectively can't be fired. Speed kills!"
35,2017-08-17T01:15:24+00:00,fintail,"Saw a white Giulia today, turn signal not in use. So, either a former BMW/Audi driver, or the signal didn't work, equal chance"
36,2017-08-17T16:52:39+00:00,andres3,I'd like to see turn signal enforcement from the traffic cops. Not a common enough violation down here in Sunshine State to have seen it carried out right in front of a cops nose though.
37,2017-08-17T20:43:54+00:00,fintail,It's like every other BMW/Audi/highline SUV around here. Entire car stereotypes can get started with signal use.
38,2017-08-17T21:05:15+00:00,andres3,Lack of turn signals is not tolerated in my area. I'll honk every time for that violation. I'll probably only notice it if it impedes my travel.

That car, as it approached me in the '11 Kia Soul, just sucked me in. Oh yeah, tractor beam! That widemouth guppy front looks even better in person. The white looks great on that car.

Now to get a job so I can consider a purchase. Tomorrow I am getting a planned interview call from Wenatchee, WA's, hospital, and Jefferson City, MO's, hospital. And also an introductory ""get to know me"" call from the Lab Manager in Littleton, NH's hospital. Sheesh. When the sun shines it shines really bright, gentlemen!  "
42,2017-08-21T01:02:35+00:00,fintail,"Went out looking around today, stopped a few dealerships. It's funny how an AMG GT Cabrio seems like a good value at 135K compared to the C63 Cabrio that stickered at around 100K, and a couple M4s at 90K. MB dealer also had a nice E400 wagon, but not too loaded, 68K. The showroom also contained a launch edition E400 coupe, loaded, 78K. BMW had a loaded 750 for 116K, and a lot of new 5ers.

48,2017-08-21T23:04:10+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,A Chevy Volt for a Cadillac price.
49,2017-08-22T00:37:55+00:00,laurasdada,"Yes, Caddy's brilliance at (pricing) creating the ""Halo"" car; Allante, XLR, ELR..."
0,2017-08-22T00:58:17+00:00,qbrozen,"XLR wasn't the Volt, shifty. That's the ELR. The XLR was on the corvette platform but with a northstar engine. Yikes.

Andres, I would not quite put it in the same boat. The XLR was a sporty 2-seater. The Ciel was supposed to be a big 4-seater luxo-cruiser. More like a cutrate Bentley Continental droptop, methinks."
1,2017-08-22T01:12:39+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new style XC60 today, also what looked like a S65 coupe, yes please."
2,2017-08-22T01:57:12+00:00,stickguy,did not realize the new XC60 was out already. Something else to stop and look at one of these days!
3,2017-08-22T03:01:57+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Oops! My mistake, Read the letters too fast!

But you know, the same problem applies. Cadillac comes in at the wrong price point, and the competition (in the case of the XLR, Benz, in the case of the ELR, their own parent company!) just kills it.

Cadillac was trying to build a 70s era Mercedes 450SL, and Mercedes was just about to launch a 90s era 500SL.

On top of all that, the vaunted Northstar turned out to be a bit of a dud."
4,2017-08-22T12:37:22+00:00,qbrozen,"Reread my post and realized it may not have come across as intended. Just to clarify, my ""yikes"" was in regard to the northstar engine, not the xlr/elr mixup."
5,2017-08-22T13:31:57+00:00,fintail,"Funny how nobody has been able to really answer the SL. Allante came and went, XLR came and went, SC430 came and went, and the boulevard cruiser cruises on."
6,2017-08-22T16:15:50+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Not only that, their answers were pretty awful. Hard to believe, but the ""SL"" debuted in 1954! That's a might long run!"
7,2017-08-22T17:33:44+00:00,texases,"Hard for anyone else to compensate for the huge 'it' factor of the SL. It would take a GREAT car, but none have been."
8,2017-08-23T01:13:16+00:00,fintail,"I wonder if the ""it"" factor can survive new generations. MB doesn't seem to really be losing cachet even with cheaper models, maybe it can. Right now, people under 50 will see an SL as an old persons car - perfect for the Lucille Bluth set or a nice rich retired doctor in LaJolla or Boca.

On the road today saw a non-AMG C cabrio and a Lexus LC."
9,2017-08-23T22:04:55+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"New white Chevy Suburban LS 4X4---all 5800 lbs. of it crossing the front of my Mini--for a minute there I thought it was a tidal wave about to hit. That thing is BIG. (225"") , and 6ft 3in high."
10,2017-08-23T22:41:16+00:00,andres3,"Speaking of big, it has been a very long time since I've seen a Hummer H1 or H2 out in the wild. H3's don't count, but those are rare too."
11,2017-08-23T23:46:47+00:00,texases,Did you feel a gravitational tug?
12,2017-08-24T00:35:58+00:00,qbrozen,"I see H2s fairly often around here. Just saw a metallic tan one on my way home this evening, as a matter of fact. Not as common as Tesla sightings, but I'd guesstimate I see 2/month."
13,2017-08-24T01:10:54+00:00,fintail,"Not new, but a new experience for me - I drove a co-worker's 2 or 3 year old F150 King Ranch Ecoboost. Surprisingly easy to drive, as I haven't driven anything that size in ages. Made getting back in my car feel like being a go-kart."
14,2017-08-24T01:42:40+00:00,berri,That's a big 10-4 Buddy
15,2017-08-24T03:30:44+00:00,fintail,"No CB, but it does have a bullbar and winch etc. Easy to drive, I was always mindful of the dimensions, however.

I saw another Lexus LC on the road."
16,2017-08-24T03:34:08+00:00,stickguy,"I had a rental Uhaul Ford Transit last weekend. Drove really nice. handled well, smooth engine. Light years ahead of the GMC van I had a year ago. And also better than the Euro style Dodge van I had recently.

yeah it was big, but didn't feel it.

the thing that bothers me about PUs these days isn't the length, it is the giant high rise hoods that make it hard to know where the front end is. Must be used to shorter, sloped hoods!"
17,2017-08-24T05:01:16+00:00,Michaell,"There is an H3 down the block from me, and an H2 pickup on the next block over."
18,2017-08-24T13:27:35+00:00,fintail,"H2s and H3s aren't insanely rare even here, although the H3 pickup is a bit of a unicorn. Definitely see more Teslas than either. Both are obnoxious in their own way."
19,2017-08-24T13:50:50+00:00,Michaell,"I'd agree - I see more Teslas than Hummers here in Colorado, as well.

Of course, Colorado has one of the largest state level tax incentives for hybrids in the country."
20,2017-08-24T16:22:20+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,What a porkbarrel.
21,2017-08-24T18:46:34+00:00,ab348,And all that weed cash needs to be put into something.
22,2017-08-24T18:49:13+00:00,kyfdx,Doritos
23,2017-08-24T19:48:22+00:00,Michaell,"Technically, the sales tax from marijuana sales is put into K-12 education, but I see your point."
24,2017-08-25T01:18:30+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Did you feel a gravitational tug?

Man if that thing hit me they wouldn't even know it until I texted them from under the truck."
25,2017-08-25T01:24:48+00:00,fintail,"Saw an Evoque cabrio today, for the spoiled coed spawn of a Supercharged Range Rover driver."
26,2017-08-25T01:26:08+00:00,fintail,"I can't wait for that ridiculous break to end. I don't know if people will learn that trickle down doesn't work, and those things aren't ""zero emissions"". Around here, they seem to emit more lack of self-awareness smug emissions than Prius.

Regarding pot taxes, I have no idea where they go here, obviously not into infrastructure."
27,2017-08-25T01:55:44+00:00,Michaell,"Free market - yeah, right.

The same folks who would scream bloody murder about the EV ""rebates"" being pulled are the same folks whinging about welfare."
28,2017-08-25T03:44:14+00:00,fintail,"Those who preach free markets are often the last to practice them.

I don't have real issue with a minor incentive for commuter box type cars, but when 100K+ fancy toys sometimes receive five figures worth of combined breaks, it's insane, especially at a time when there's a housing crisis, socio-economic chasm, etc. No doubt the recipients feel it is a reward for ""sacrifice"", let them eat cake."
29,2017-08-26T13:25:49+00:00,explorerx4,A red Buick Cascada with the top down.
30,2017-08-26T14:45:38+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I don't see a bright future for that car. Opel-based, slower than a UPS truck, and not cheap."
31,2017-08-26T16:05:36+00:00,ab348,I think rental car agencies like them.
32,2017-08-26T17:25:18+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,There you go--didn't think of that. Perfect Hawaii/Florida rental car.
33,2017-08-26T19:12:03+00:00,imidazol97,"Yup. The lottery money in Ohio decades ago was supposed to go for secondary education. That was the main tenet for the lobby for the lottery. However, they put the money into secondary education and took away an equivalent amount of state funding so the schools got the same from the state portion of their funding."
34,2017-08-26T20:38:38+00:00,Michaell,"I think that's what has happened here - the MJ taxes aren't being added to the budget, and what would normally be directed to K-12 is now going other places.

At the moment, the big need here in CO is infrastructure - the legislature has tried for a couple of years to pass a bill to fund transportation projects, but haven't been able to reach an agreement. It may go to the voters next year."
35,2017-08-26T23:39:32+00:00,kyfdx,"All I have to say about that is: Duh...

Just change ""Ohio"" to the state of your choice. (mine included)"
36,2017-08-27T17:41:50+00:00,explorerx4,A dark blue Kia Niro and a silver Alpina B7.
37,2017-08-27T18:10:07+00:00,stickguy,"a burnt orange Chevy SS. Did not look as big as I expected. Not bad looking really. and passing by, a bright orange Lambo of some kind (a newer one)."
38,2017-08-28T02:38:19+00:00,fintail,"Saw another new style XC60, this one with CA ""distributor"" plates."
39,2017-08-30T20:57:23+00:00,fintail,Saw a new Camry on the road - rental.
40,2017-08-30T21:30:16+00:00,explorerx4,"In the parking lot at work, a new white Mercedes X6 clone and a black Jeep GC SRT8."
41,2017-08-30T22:20:43+00:00,Michaell,"GLE Coupe, I'd guess, if it's the same size.

Otherwise, GLC Coupe"
42,2017-08-30T23:52:29+00:00,stickguy,I was next to a GLE coupe last week. surprisingly tall. and not at all attractive.
43,2017-08-31T01:07:52+00:00,fintail,"Funny how MB and BMW sometimes copy each other. MB makes CLS, eventually BMW makes 6er Gran Coupe. BMW makes X6/X4, MB makes GLC/GLE ""coupes"". MB makes B-class, BMW makes 2er ""Active Tourer"". And so on.

Speaking of BMWs, I got behind a Rolls-Royce Ghost today, it was only going about 20 over."
44,2017-08-31T03:47:43+00:00,berri,'18 Camry rental on the street already. I suppose it is a way to get some miles on a newly released vehicle quickly for feedback.
45,2017-08-31T13:47:46+00:00,texases,"I've read a number of good reviews of the Camry, make it sound like a legit Mazda6 competitor in terms of ride and handling."
46,2017-08-31T13:53:05+00:00,fintail,"This was my second spotting of a new Camry rental. Maybe production has ramped up. For all the snark about GM and rental cars, Toyota, Nissan, and Hyunkia now are equally as involved."
47,2017-08-31T14:58:47+00:00,ab348,"In traffic about a block from my house, a nice-looking Bentley Continental coupe in a pretty light metallic blue. Couldn't see the license plate so no idea if it is a local. If it was, most people here would think the owner must have done something wrong in order to have it."
48,2017-08-31T15:05:58+00:00,texases,"Not yet. I don't understand ""M"" versions of the X5 or X6, or the top end AMG versions of MB's GLE or GLS vehicles, either."
49,2017-08-31T15:21:51+00:00,fintail,"You often don't get that kind of money by following the rules

To be fair, the typical black money set on the west coast seems to prefer German cars, aside from high spec Maserati, Range Rovers and maybe a few AMs or Rolls-Royce."
0,2017-08-31T15:31:22+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"In any event, not hard-earned money, if you can easily write off the massive depreciation rate."
1,2017-08-31T15:50:38+00:00,fintail,"I think for a Continental, where to the average punter on the street, a 10 year old car looks almost identical to a new one, they are often not on their first owner. I don't know if the maintenance can be written off so easily."
2,2017-08-31T16:25:15+00:00,ab348,"Unless there is a local indy shop that does it, the nearest Bentley service center is in Montreal, a fair distance away, especially if it would need to be flatbedded."
3,2017-08-31T21:03:24+00:00,Michaell,"Spotted something unique while out running errands today. I wasn't able to get a picture, unfortunately.

Hyundai badge. At first, it looked like the new Elantra GT (small, hatchback shape). But, I then noticed it has the blacked out wheel arches like a CUV.

New Kona? I thought it would be taller, like the HR-V or C-HR - this looked like the old Outback Sport.

Michigan manufacturers plates."
4,2017-08-31T21:13:23+00:00,Michaell,Looks like it's the Kona - found this via Google Images:
5,2017-08-31T21:20:22+00:00,explorerx4,"In the parking lot at work, a new Compass(?), the Compass/Patriot replacement."
6,2017-08-31T21:34:25+00:00,stickguy,I wanted to like the Kona. Maybe in dark blue or gray the exterior would be OK. Need to see one in person when they show up on the lots.
7,2017-08-31T22:32:15+00:00,Michaell,Depends on what engines it comes with. Would be quite fun with the 1.6T from the Elantra Sport.
8,2017-08-31T23:45:45+00:00,ab348,I thought the Kona was strictly a hybrid?
9,2017-08-31T23:50:09+00:00,Michaell,"That's the Kia Niro, which I suspect is on the same platform.

But, the Niro is FWD only, so really just a slightly lifted hatchback."
10,2017-09-01T01:06:53+00:00,fintail,"Saw a silver and black Rolls-Royce Wraith parked on the street today, maybe the same one I saw a month or two ago. No plates, no temporary registration."
11,2017-09-03T03:10:46+00:00,stickguy,"Niro is the Kia version of the Ioniq, which is all hybrid. The kona is IIRC based on accent, maybe Elantra, and just comes with 2.0l four."
12,2017-09-06T16:47:50+00:00,andres3,I think I do remember noticing rather low speed limits on the island of Maui. I had a rental Sentra.
13,2017-09-06T18:10:44+00:00,tifighter,Kia Stonic will be their version of the Kona. Hard to keep track of them all.
14,2017-09-06T19:29:00+00:00,stickguy,"Niro is same platform, different body shape."
15,2017-09-06T23:18:16+00:00,andres3,This body shop gets cars like this all the time.
16,2017-09-06T23:20:07+00:00,andres3,"Most reliable Chevy ever made.

Should have license plate ""BadPrkd"" RS7

Oh yeah, that Chevy was made by Toyota."
17,2017-09-07T01:22:54+00:00,fintail,"What are the odds the RS7 doesn't have a handicapped placard? Most don't make that kind of money by following the rules.

On that subject, I saw a Bentayga on a flatbed truck, I assume being picked for service by a concierge program. But I can hope it was being towed for illegal parking, and the clueless Stepford or sinister money launderer came out and was stumped about the location of their car."
18,2017-09-07T16:27:07+00:00,stickguy,"Volvo XC60. At the dealer. Very good looking. Phenomenal interior. Just sat in, did not drive. He demo had every option, and an eye popping 62k bottom line (before options was low 40s)"
19,2017-09-07T16:59:14+00:00,andres3,"Not sure about the odds, but that one did have the ADA placard on the mirror in front; I checked!

Still doesn't excuse the crooked parking job."
20,2017-09-07T20:04:54+00:00,Michaell,Was that a T6 or the T8?
21,2017-09-07T21:09:30+00:00,stickguy,T6.
22,2017-09-07T22:14:42+00:00,Michaell,I wonder how expensive the T8 would get?
23,2017-09-07T23:21:24+00:00,stickguy,"more if you pile on. This one was over the top, with options I doubt anyone will ever get. Well, very few people."
24,2017-09-08T16:23:11+00:00,andres3,"The ""options"" cars have available have gone nuts. But, if they are selling them, more power to them.

I just judge every expensive car to the $50K baseline I paid for my '14 S4. Yes I could have more room in an SUV at $50K, but I'd rather have the S4 for every other reason imaginable.

I'm not rich but I got to own a brand new S4 made in Germany for 4 months (made in Escondido after that). To keep things affordable, I did without built-in Navigation, rear-view camera, and perhaps a couple other safety sensors/radars now widely available.

If people realized a loaded up ""economy"" car wasn't that much cheaper than a stripped out luxury car, I think more would opt for the stripper luxo-sport car. I think the other reason more people don't follow in my footsteps is availability. Higher end dealers don't like taking up any allocation on ""stripper"" models."
25,2017-09-08T16:29:06+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I just priced one out, and yeah, the T6 you looked at obviously had every option box checked."
26,2017-09-10T16:34:41+00:00,texases,"Followed a new CRV. The rear end has graduated from 'quirky' to 'goofy', to me. "
27,2017-09-10T16:39:22+00:00,stickguy,"nice interior, but my wife really does not care for the looks of the butt end."
28,2017-09-10T19:13:49+00:00,explorerx4,"I think Toyota started the trend of lights jutting out sideways from the fenders.
A lot of other vehicles are styled like that now."
29,2017-09-10T23:51:04+00:00,berri,I think overwrought styling is kinda becoming the norm lately. Hello 1959!
30,2017-09-11T01:20:49+00:00,tjc78,It seems at least GM has some restraint.  The Japanese makes certainly do not. 
31,2017-09-12T13:48:05+00:00,fintail,"I saw a Rolls-Royce Ghost yesterday driven by who I think might have been a football player - very large/built youngish guy with flamboyant hair, probably not a hedge fund owner"
32,2017-09-12T17:31:03+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"yeah might be. Some of those guys sign big first year contracts, start spending money and then it hits them ""Oh, I owe taxes on this""?"
33,2017-09-12T17:37:40+00:00,Michaell,"If it's a football player, rookie contracts are strictly managed in the player agreement between the union and the league.

Now, someone who's signed a new contract would certainly have enough $$$ to get a Rolls."
34,2017-09-12T18:12:07+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yes that's true. They do try to protect newbies. Depreciation on a new Rolls does make one think about ""funny money"" though."
35,2017-09-12T18:20:19+00:00,stickguy,Could be a loaner? Drives it around for free for publicity.
36,2017-09-13T01:11:00+00:00,fintail,"Today saw a white Ferrari 488 and silver Ferrari F12 on the road, and a recently registered Range Rover Sport ""Autobiography"" (sounds like a model Edwina Monsoon would buy) in the workplace parking garage."
37,2017-09-22T01:16:24+00:00,fintail,"Saw my first new E-class coupe on the road today (I have seen one at a show and at the dealer). It's a pretty posh package, and really shows how MB is moving to smooth soft lines from a generation of angular styles and creases. As creases are now the thing with mainstream brands, I wonder when they will follow suit."
38,2017-09-22T14:23:11+00:00,texases,"Saw my first new Miata hardtop. Most unusual thing was the paint - kind of a dove grey, not metallic. I can't find it on their web site. Custom?"
39,2017-09-22T16:32:13+00:00,andres3,"Is that like a flat looking ""battleship"" grey? It has been made popular in the Audi ranks as R8's are available in what they call ""NARDO.""

One woman reviewer on YouTube didn't get it, and called it ""concrete grey.""

Makes sense that the Military and Navy guys would like it. Lot of those guys around here."
40,2017-09-22T16:40:35+00:00,qbrozen,"Saw an F-type before leaving my neighborhood today and realized it is the first one I have seen in the wild. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Front struck me initially as a bit Saturn Sky, but overall the car is beautiful."
41,2017-09-22T16:52:03+00:00,texases,"Yes, I almost called it 'battleship grey'. But it was gloss, not flat."
42,2017-09-22T17:39:34+00:00,andres3,Nardo:
43,2017-09-22T17:56:58+00:00,texases,"Yep, like that, maybe a shade lighter."
44,2017-09-22T18:25:19+00:00,kyfdx,I really like that color
45,2017-09-22T20:16:55+00:00,ab348,"Scion had a shiny non-metallic gray like that too. I think it was called ""Cement"", how glam. A little too grunge/hippie for my liking but to each their own I guess."
46,2017-09-22T20:29:50+00:00,andres3,"I'd of gone with the name ""Mortar"" myself."
47,2017-09-23T01:43:00+00:00,berri,"Wonder how long that clear coat primer will be popular Seriously, it does look better than I originally thought the concept would."
48,2017-09-24T01:13:48+00:00,qbrozen,"Speaking of flat finish, this was in front of the PetCo today."
49,2017-09-24T02:54:01+00:00,kyfdx,I can see a Yorkie..
0,2017-09-24T03:25:59+00:00,fintail,"MB is of questionable taste, and that's 100% stock. No doubt in a front plate state but not using one, too, as I am sure the law is enforced via socio-economic boundaries."
1,2017-09-24T17:49:04+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Flip down the roof, and lose your trunk space. Brilliant!"
2,2017-09-24T17:59:16+00:00,fintail,I wonder what amount of late model SLs ever venture more than 75 miles from home.
3,2017-09-24T18:00:42+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,I always thought hardtop convertibles were a bad idea. I still do.
4,2017-09-24T18:21:57+00:00,kyfdx,"I think it depends on where you live. The increased visibility over a soft-top is great for the 8 months of top-up weather that we have. And, no trunk issues for those months either, obviously.

If it's a daily driver, I could see it."
5,2017-09-24T19:37:35+00:00,berri,"Sometimes compromise creates synergy, sometimes mediocrity"
6,2017-09-24T20:23:19+00:00,kyfdx,Spotted a new TLX A-Spec SH-AWD. Impressive looking.
7,2017-09-25T00:04:22+00:00,fintail,"In a rainy place, a hardtop convertible makes sense - occasional adjustments or repairs of the mechanism are probably easier to live with than cloth top issues in damp weather. I would also prefer it for a DD - I doubt many haul family car-amounts of luggage anyway."
8,2017-09-26T01:21:28+00:00,fintail,"A few new ones ones on the road today - A5 hatchback, hockey stick 5er hybrid, Velar (first I have seen)"

10,2017-09-26T02:29:23+00:00,fintail,I checked Youtube - nothing. This might be my only chance to be famous!
11,2017-09-27T17:55:20+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I think ""repairs"" are more in the frightening category, if/when they occur. Remember when detachable hardtops were the rage, and NOBODY ever used them? So the hardtop convertible was a compromise. But you have a point--this is more of a toy car than a family car."
12,2017-09-27T18:23:54+00:00,fintail,"Yep, convertibles are toys. They won't see the same miles and hard use as a family car.

I suppose the most worrisome ones would be MB R230 SL, R171 SLK, VW Eos, BMW F30, maybe final run Chrysler Sebring, etc. I know top issues are not unknown on early R230, but aren't universal. I don't know about the rest. I think for detachable hardtops, many just stay on the car. Most R107 SL I see always have the top on, and E36 so-equipped always seem to have it, too."
13,2017-09-28T00:53:24+00:00,fintail,3 new Camrys on the road today. I think at least one was a rental.

17,2017-09-28T22:39:45+00:00,kyfdx,"Saw a whole truckload headed north on I-75. Of course, I was just north of the Camry factory."
18,2017-09-29T01:11:50+00:00,fintail,"Lots of beautiful scenery on the road there no doubt

Saw a Titan diesel on the road, not many of those around."

20,2017-10-03T01:17:57+00:00,fintail,Saw a dark blue hockey stick 5er in traffic today.
21,2017-10-03T12:15:18+00:00,stickguy,Volvo XC60. Fantastic seats and interior.
22,2017-10-03T17:53:20+00:00,andres3,"Spotted a 90's era Camaro joining the ACLA group for a very spirited Highway 33 jaunt. Unfortunately for them, at less than mile marker 10 on the mountain, they ended up about 10' below the road, and about 10' adjacent to the road, and oh yeah, upside down (shiny side down)!

Fortunately for the old man driver (you'd think old men would have more common-sense!), he landed on a bunch of bushes and bushy trees with a bed of soft sand. That soft cushioned landing saved his hide. He was shorter stature, and thin, so he was able to just barely get out of the car though the side window with some help from other drivers.

Lucky only to have some scratches from the broken glass sliding out of the car.

Higher up on the mountain might have been a longer fall than just 10' off the side of the road rolling over. Typical over-correction over-steer issues of that kind of vehicle based on the skid marks. Someone mentioned a Bilstein suspension, but I suspect there's only so much you can do with that chassis that doesn't make it a good selection for canyon carving.

The M3's, 4's, 2's, TTRS, TTS, S4's & S5's, and modern Corvette, and Mustang GT all made it to the end of the day without incident."
23,2017-10-03T18:08:40+00:00,fintail,"Ha, why would you think that?

Saw another new Camry, this one a higher spec, non-rental."
24,2017-10-03T18:53:17+00:00,andres3,"Isn't there an old saying about being ""old & wise?""

Maybe he was reliving his youth.

Being that there is no reception for cellphones on that mountain, it was a long time before we realized we had ""lost"" a third of the group. They were nice enough to stay behind until help arrived."
25,2017-10-04T20:08:07+00:00,fintail,"Spotted a new style Tiguan, thought I would see more by now."
26,2017-10-06T01:15:05+00:00,fintail,In traffic today: rental new Camry and a VW Atlas.
27,2017-10-06T01:20:24+00:00,stickguy,I saw an Atlas on the road a few days ago. Nice looking.
28,2017-10-12T00:28:36+00:00,fintail,"I think I might have seen a Kia Stinger today. Looked like a shinier fancier Optima, but seemed larger (it was from a distance)."
29,2017-10-12T00:29:50+00:00,kyfdx,Cadenza?
30,2017-10-12T00:39:01+00:00,fintail,"Nope not a Cadenza, I have seen several of those."

32,2017-10-12T00:54:08+00:00,stickguy,a new Camry out driving around. Not even a rental!
33,2017-10-16T20:21:00+00:00,fintail,"Saw a non-rental Camry too, and a Buick Envision - not new, but quite rare, I see more Lamborghinis on the road. I don't know if I can envision myself in a Chinese-made GM CUV"
34,2017-10-17T01:47:45+00:00,berri,Envision doesn't seem to get anything better than mediocre reviews.
35,2017-10-17T17:30:28+00:00,qbrozen,"Saw my first V90 in the wild. Black on black with black or charcoal or just really dirty wheels.

Good looking vehicle other than those wheels. Seemed to be sagging in the back."
36,2017-10-17T18:13:51+00:00,stickguy,I just don't like cars that long.
37,2017-10-17T19:16:09+00:00,qbrozen,"i think it is more of an illusion. It is only a foot longer than the XC60 and V60, and, interestingly enough, about an inch shorter than a Caddy CTS and only 2 inches longer than a 2018 Accord."
38,2017-10-18T01:07:39+00:00,fintail,Saw another new Tiguan today.
39,2017-10-18T06:10:35+00:00,andres3,Saw a Kia Optima dawdle along holding up traffic until at least 5 cars trailed them on the scenic way home. It wasn't me. I was one of the 5. Idiotic they didn't let people pass.
40,2017-10-24T13:27:09+00:00,fintail,"Laws are only meaningful if the powers that be have the desire to enforce them. They love speeding, and don't care about many others.

Saw another new non-rental Camry, they seem to be selling here. Spectacularly unpretty, but I notice the glass seems to be tall, which is a good trend. Of course, still thick pillars and poor rearward visibility."
41,2017-10-24T14:13:19+00:00,fushigi,Agreed. We've never needed (and still do not need) the 'no cell phones/texting while driving' laws as there have been distracted driving laws on the books for decades. What was always lacking was enforcement.
42,2017-10-24T15:56:47+00:00,fintail,"Enforcement and IMO citations with teeth. Some of the fines out there don't seem low enough to be a deterrent.

I suspect if the enforcement community would go after phone users and non-signalers like they chase violators of often arbitrary speed limits, they could erase the national debt. I know of local intersections where I swear half the cars are either not using a signal or the driver is holding a phone."
43,2017-10-24T21:29:24+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new Odyssey, reminds me of the old one but with the now trendy faux floating C-pillar."
44,2017-10-26T01:20:01+00:00,fintail,"Saw another new Odyssey today - reminds me of a stretched Opel Adam. Also an A5 sportback,"
45,2017-10-31T01:08:26+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Velar today, should be a good seller with the leisure demographic in Bellevue."
46,2017-10-31T17:51:52+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"That should punch out at close to $60K with options, don't you think?"
47,2017-10-31T18:13:26+00:00,andres3,"Easy solution, make the 1st cell phone/distracted driving offense equal to what they charge for a red-light camera violation ($500+). They love camera fines being high, why not make the important violations equally high? None of this $100-$200 BS for the first offense.

I've heard there might be legislation approved in CA making the right turn on red without a complete stop a reduced fine as compared to actually running the red light. I suppose I should thank the camera industry for this one as no one liked getting fined $550 for a 1-2 MPH (or even less) discrepancy in stopping."
48,2017-10-31T18:18:29+00:00,Michaell,"When was the last time you were at a LR dealership?

I was at one last Saturday - the Velar we looked at was north of $60K

Folks in the leasing thread have quoted sticker prices of $70K and higher, depending on engine, trim level and options."
49,2017-10-31T18:31:35+00:00,fintail,"Also extra fines for yappers in cars with bluetooth, and then make the fines progressive. I love seeing a late model Range Rover/Tesla/senior MB-BMW etc where the ""driver"" has a phone to their ear. If these people are supposed to be smarter and more logical and harder working than most everyone else, they sure have a funny way of showing it. Or maybe they know they are virtually untouchable in what is becoming an oligocracy."
0,2017-10-31T18:32:32+00:00,fintail,"Yeah, add 20%, and I think they lease poorly. I suspect a number of these will sell for cash though, to the same people who buy local real estate for cash. Completely on the up and up, nothing to see here."
1,2017-10-31T19:02:30+00:00,jpp75,"Saw a Kia Niro yesterday, first one I've seen in the wild."
2,2017-10-31T19:04:06+00:00,kyfdx,"New Tiguan. First one that I’ve seen. Nice looking, but very generic. Looks better than the pictures."
3,2017-10-31T20:26:46+00:00,laurasdada,"Gray Mazda MX-5 RF. Adorable.
White Lexus LC500. Slick."
4,2017-10-31T21:18:39+00:00,tlong,Plenty of BMW i3's. A new VW Atlas and a new Tiguan. A new Camry.
5,2017-11-01T01:07:12+00:00,fintail,And yet another stretched Opel Adam Odyssey.
6,2017-11-01T21:10:02+00:00,ab348,"This was at my tire shop today, newish but not brand new. Snazzy looking little thing, I loved the paint color."
7,2017-11-01T22:30:21+00:00,kyfdx,Nothing sounds better than an Aston Martin
8,2017-11-03T17:41:00+00:00,fintail,"Viewed this new style Aston Martin from my hotel room this afternoon:



And this was parked on the street in front:"
9,2017-11-03T20:48:41+00:00,laurasdada,"To my eye, the MB S Coupe is a beauty! As is the AM DB11, of course!"
10,2017-11-03T21:04:35+00:00,explorerx4,Looks like a neighbor down the street swapped her older XC60 for a white Mustang convertible.
11,2017-11-03T21:23:02+00:00,texases,"Saw a new Atlas or Tiguan today at a distance. Any easy way to tell them apart?

Seems like VW's hopped on the Audi/BMW/MB same-styling club."
12,2017-11-03T22:25:33+00:00,stickguy,the Atlas is the size of a Tahoe with a giant blocky hood. The tiguan is a little smaller.
13,2017-11-05T18:38:14+00:00,fintail,"Saw a GLC plug in hybrid today. Not new, also saw a couple BMW 2 ""active tourer"", showing how MB and BMW like to copy each other. Also, a surprising amount of GLC and GLE ""coupe""s, such a pretty and practical design.

So far in Germany - zero Lexus, one Infiniti."
14,2017-11-05T18:46:47+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Don't know as I'd use the word pretty but the AMG version sure can move right along.
15,2017-11-05T19:08:02+00:00,fintail,"Pretty is in jest. IMO, the ""coupe"" SUVs are every bit as awkward as the X4 and X6."
16,2017-11-05T20:00:30+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"This is one of those ""love it or hate it"" designs, I guess, like a Hummer."
17,2017-11-07T18:03:48+00:00,fintail,"I actually saw 3 Lexus in Prague today, a record for Europe. 2 NX and 1 RX, no surprise, they compete in the CUV demographic more than cars.

I was in the tonier part of old town for awhile, saw a Rolls Royce Wraith, a couple Bentaygas, late model Ferraris, S600 Maybach, a new style Aston, etc."
18,2017-11-08T06:51:06+00:00,tlong,"Currently driving a Cruze rental. A few years ago I drove one and thought it was decent but the engine was coarse. Happy to report that the new one is much smoother. It has auto-stop/start and that seems to work smoothly. The ride is a little bit wallowy in the front end but suspension and steering are fairly taut. Overall not bad at all, continues to improve and leagues ahead of 10-15 years ago in terms of sedans from GM."
19,2017-11-08T15:46:48+00:00,stickguy,"Other day, a VW atlas out in the wild. So they sold at least 1."
20,2017-11-08T15:56:44+00:00,qbrozen,"I spotted one of those Atlases this week, too. Nothing very distinctive about it. Rather boring ""me too"" vehicle.

Also spotted a Levante yesterday. Same deal. Other than the grille, just nothing special about it. The profile could easily be an Infiniti, and the rear looks like a Kia. Pretty sure I'd rather have an F-pace."
21,2017-11-08T16:14:45+00:00,Michaell,"You should hear the Levante with the 'sport' exhaust mode turned on. You might change your opinion.

Would scare all the soccer moms picking up Buffy and Muffy from the private day school."
22,2017-11-08T17:40:51+00:00,fintail,"In suburban Seattle, that's who the Levante sells to - Stepfords. That and the devilspawn of money launderers who are able to purchase vetting.

I've noticed sunroofs aren't as popular here in Czech as they are in Germany - I have seen numerous near-new MB and BMW, not taxis, not apparent rentals, without sunroof, Can't get them that way in the states."
23,2017-11-08T19:11:49+00:00,andres3,"M2 is sunroof-less. M235/240i has to be special ordered with moonroof delete option. All glass roofs seem to be ""in"" right now with the hip and fashionable crowd."
24,2017-11-08T19:19:57+00:00,fintail,"I'm talking like E-class and 5ers. I don't think either exists even as a special order without sunroof in the US - likely due to a big potential resale hit.

My E has pano, and I like the feature a lot, really brightens up the interior on dreary days."
25,2017-11-08T19:26:22+00:00,stickguy,"I was fine moving from the pano on the Sonata to a normal moonroof on the elantra. Still get my fresh air, and light into the interior. I don't sit in the back, so no worries there. The Pano roofs tend to have more issues. Even ignoring the occasional explosion, they usually creak more and probably better chance might leak.

I think Hyundai learned a lesson, because on the redesigned 2018 Sonata, they moved from a Pano roof on the limited to a normal moonroof."
26,2017-11-08T19:57:43+00:00,fintail,"I notice some cars have roofs painted to simulate a pano roof, which is kind of dorky. I have yet to have a rattle in a MB pano car, but I have read of others - apparently, a simple cure by tightening bolts that come loose over time. Never heard of leaks on MB anyway.

Today in Prague spotted 2x Lexus (sedans! GS and LS) and my first Tesla of this trip. I don't mind not seeing those 4 wheeled Faberge eggs on every corner like I do at home."
27,2017-11-08T20:38:24+00:00,ab348,I posted a link here a few weeks ago about a Transport Canada investigation into exploding pano sunroofs. Hyundai had the worst track record in that regard.
28,2017-11-09T18:01:05+00:00,fintail,"Saw another Lexus today, but not new, and out in the country. Saw an AMG GT today in central Prague, cool alternative to a Porsche."
29,2017-11-09T18:09:19+00:00,iluvmysephia1,"Seen a Subaru Impreza over there yet, fintail?"
30,2017-11-09T18:17:08+00:00,fintail,"Subarus are here, but seem to be a minor player - virtually all Outbacks and Foresters."
31,2017-11-09T19:58:31+00:00,iluvmysephia1,Ahh. I knew there was something about Europe that sort of... frightened me.

I'm 3/4 Norwegian, of course I would. The other 4th of me is British! I would love Europe but I'm too close to retirement and all I can think is of retiring. I can't put aside money to fly there now - all I'd be thinking of would be the next Toyota Yaris iA I want or the next little eastern Washington house the Mrs. and I want to buy.

But if I was younger (and even now) I would have a ball there. Of course I'd love to see Norway and the Colisseum in Rome, Italy.

Besides that, I'd love to see all of the interesting rigs over there. For sure! Have fun, man.

What do you think of the VW Jetta, fin? Pfft. See what I mean? There I go again."
34,2017-11-09T21:41:40+00:00,tlong,"Europe is really cheap to fly to in the winter as demand is low. Sometimes less than cross country flights in the US.
We were in Prague in late summer and yes there was a diverse set of cars. I got a picture of myself standing in front of the Rolls dealer."
35,2017-11-10T08:34:19+00:00,fintail,"That's right, I paid less for my nonstop RT flight than a co-worker did for a flight to NC back in the spring. Cheapest I had ever seen, which is why I impulse-booked it. The months in between gave me time to plan the trip and pay for most of it, so I won't have a ton of bills when I return.

Another co-worker flew to Geneva or Paris in June, and it was cheaper yet, something like $560. Seattle has some low cost carriers to Europe now (Icelandair, Norwegian) , so there's competition. I've seen some pretty cheap flights out of Seattle to China, too.

I saw that Rolls-Royce dealer in Prague the other day, in the ritzy Pariszka area. That's where one goes for exotic spotting."
36,2017-11-10T09:25:23+00:00,fintail,"It's always key to spend less than you make, but at the same time, live a little, you have earned it

About 10 years ago, after my dad passed too young, I realized that tomorrow isn't guaranteed. The way I see it now, as long as one has income greater than outflow, and maybe puts a little away for tomorrow, they should also enjoy the fruits of their labor. Being a miser is good for heirs and lawyers, not more. I hope you get a chance to see those places, too.

Jetta, as the Limeys called it. ""Golf with a boot"". Probably a nice car in the segment with some German engineering behind it, but I think the US spec models were decontented, at least in basic form.

That was the car I took all around Seattle when I turned 16. Seattle was a wild place in the wild 70's. I'm glad I made it home safe (every time!). I drove my parents nuts many a time. But if a modern V-Dub could be anywhere near as fun ta drive as that Fastback I'd be down with giving it a try.

There's several of us living near Seattle. Maybe an Auto Show Meetup would be fun sometime, eh? I'd love to see your nickname car."
38,2017-11-10T11:03:08+00:00,fintail,"I suspect any modern VW would be like a supercar compared to a Fastback/Type 3, especially in terms of acceleration and stability. I have to imagine the rear engine/RWD setup of that car could be quirky in terms of handling. Seattle must have been wild then indeed, an age when normal working class people could afford houses in the city. Unimaginable today.

Speaking of VWs and your love of small cars, the train I am on just passed several train car carriers of assorted VW Up! (not sold in the US) , maybe you'd want these:



I believe they are built in Slovakia, not far from where I am right now. I'd like to be in that old car here, it would get a ton of positive attention - not like it doesn't at home, as it becomes a little more unusual with each passing year.

I always seem to take my vacations around the time of the auto show, but I attended a few years ago. Looks like this year a meetup isn't going to happen either. Maybe next year.

fintail - I do like the VW Up! I just bounce around quite a bit in my research of and excitement for automobiles. Actually, my excitement level stays pretty much level - and by that I mean strong. As I re-open the Toyota Yaris iA file, I notice that Toyota is pricing them at only $15,995 for the 6-speed stick, 2018 model. Nice. And that means the primo Mazda 6-speed transmission installed, too. 

I also noticed at AutoNation in Spokane they're selling a brand new 2017 Toyota Corolla iM for only $16,975. That is also for the 6-speed and the color is white. Sounds weird to add Corolla before the iM but Toyota categorized it that way after Scion folded. I have loved several Scion's, the first one being the small xA."
41,2017-11-10T17:00:35+00:00,fintail,"Scion was a funny thing - cynical marketing exercise, the youfs mostly saw right through it, and it ended up appealing most to practical mature folks. IIRC, they didn't even try that trick outside USA and Canada. iA is a lot of mouth for the money"

Also inside the factory gates (photos forbidden) saw 4 or 5 test mule of prepro updated CLS (I think) in varying camo, a couple of heavily disguised what looked like GLC, and a camo A-class 5 door.

This was the scene at the ""Center of Excellence"" on a frosty clear morning:



And in front they had a couple of these cladded E-wagons posed on an incline to demonstrate off roading, I guess:"

And here I thought it was only a US thing..."

8,2017-11-15T20:43:00+00:00,tlong,"Wagons are very popular in Europe, SUVs not nearly as much"
9,2017-11-15T21:03:13+00:00,fintail,"Yep, full sized ones aren't so common here, a tall wagon is more likely. CUVs are big, but not like in Seattle. Wagons still to appear to outnumber them both."
10,2017-11-15T21:07:50+00:00,Michaell,Do you think this has to do with turning circle and maneuverability?
11,2017-11-15T21:10:16+00:00,fintail,"Size certainly has a lot to do with it. Even the height-seeking mommy set here doesn't seem to need more than a small CUV or maybe an AWD wagon. Of course, the Stepford set still buys many of the same things here as in the US, save for Lexus, which exists, but not with huge influence."

29,2017-11-23T16:24:55+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"""Luxury"" is really a marketing term, isn't it? I mean, it's hard to quantify exactly. You can spend $80K for a Ford F-250 Platinum edition pickup, but is that ""luxury"", even thought the seats are leather, and heated and cooled, and give you a massage?"
30,2017-11-23T16:44:00+00:00,fintail,"I loathe Honda's new trim detail theme at the end of side windows, like the rear quarter window on the Accord. Pointless goofty different for the sake of different design ""flair"" that I would have to modify if I owned one. A vibrating hood would also bug me to no end. Still, I'd probably choose it over a Camry, based on looks alone."

I don't want all of the gills and stickers and double decker spoilers etc. Maybe have a slightly different stance, barely-different wheels, subtle exhaust tips, maybe a lip spoiler, and that's it.

36,2017-12-05T02:10:27+00:00,fintail,Saw 2 new E-class coupes in traffic this evening.
37,2017-12-07T02:19:14+00:00,stickguy,"was out walking the dog around the neighborhood, and hard something that sounded unique coming up behind me. Turned out to be a V10 audi R8. Convertible. Interesting looking, but IMO not attractive in white with a black top (cold today, so it was up). But, I would not kick it out of bed."
38,2017-12-07T20:31:03+00:00,tifighter,"Yesterday I saw my first Lexus LC500. Dark metallic red. It is pretty striking in person; I can't decide if it will age well or not yet. But it looks like you spent the money, and in the expensive coupe market, that's half the battle. It is distinctive."
39,2017-12-07T22:31:22+00:00,Michaell,"I saw a white one some months back, and share the same opinions as you."
40,2017-12-08T03:44:38+00:00,fintail,"I've seen a few LC in Bellevue. Striking anyway, yes. They are 100K, so they should be special in some way."
41,2017-12-09T16:40:56+00:00,explorerx4,A orangy/copper color Chevy Bolt. Kind of thought it was a Honda Fit at first glance.
42,2017-12-09T17:49:28+00:00,fintail,"Velar, for when an Evoque is too proletarian, and a Sport is too hard to park."
43,2017-12-10T02:48:32+00:00,Michaell,"Took a ride in a Velar when @jpp5862 test drove one. Beautiful, but cramped, interior. I think of it as the RR X6"
44,2017-12-10T03:47:41+00:00,fintail,"Not a bad comparison. A Sport is probably a degree higher, so the Velar fits in. For better or worse, the high riding low headroom ostentatious CUV/SUV is a thing now, and probably here to stay, X6 really got that wonderful ball rolling."
45,2017-12-10T23:17:32+00:00,qbrozen,"Saw a Velar today, as a matter of fact. Not very attractive, IMHO. Wife actually said ""ew."""
46,2017-12-11T00:10:41+00:00,fintail,Saw an E63s wagon at the MB dealer - 123K.
47,2017-12-11T05:55:30+00:00,Michaell,Isn't that the end of the year bonus amount for many of the techies in your neck of the woods?
48,2017-12-11T14:23:02+00:00,fintail,"That's about right, it's also probably about the weekly allowance for many in the satellite child devilspawn demographic around here.

1,2017-12-15T16:29:09+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I *thought* I saw the 2018 Jeep Wrangler going the opposite way on the freeway but only got a quick glimpse--are they on the road yet?

I've seen video reviews of it, and it looks to be a better Wrangler in every possible way."
2,2017-12-15T18:32:58+00:00,Michaell,"I didn't think the new ones had been released yet. We have lease numbers for the 2018's, but I'd guess the new one will be a 2019 model year."
3,2017-12-15T19:18:50+00:00,stickguy,Same as the remodeled Jetta due out soon. Short MY 2018 of the old style.
4,2017-12-16T02:50:31+00:00,fintail,New E300 parked beside me at work - still had window sticker residue (not the best detail?). Then saw a new style E coupe on the road.
5,2017-12-22T19:18:48+00:00,explorerx4,A new Impreza sedan in a nice aqua blue color.
6,2017-12-27T23:45:37+00:00,qbrozen,Saw my first Stelvio today on the open road. White. Sharp car.
7,2017-12-28T18:45:42+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Very sharp in the front end. Must be a hell of a blind spot looking rearwards, though."
8,2017-12-29T02:06:01+00:00,fintail,"New-ish, saw a Continental today that wasn't a rental or fleet car. Not a bad looking car."
9,2017-12-29T02:08:30+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Reminds me a bit of a Tesla Model S. Spokey wheels, big hips."
10,2017-12-29T02:20:09+00:00,fintail,"But it has a grille, not egg shaped, not flocked to by over-monied eco-dorks

I suspect depreciation is fierce, too, might be a good used buy."
11,2017-12-29T17:24:02+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yes, I was thinking that depreciation is going to hit those Alfas pretty hard. It's difficult to rebound from a bad launch in the car mags and vlogs."
12,2017-12-29T17:40:10+00:00,fintail,"Oh, I was thinking about the Lincoln

Alfa depreciation will probably be worse!"
13,2017-12-29T17:59:42+00:00,ab348,"Spotted an Alfa Romeo Giulia on a flatbed today (the jokes sort of write themselves....).

The odd thing is that we don't have a dealer locally, with the nearest being in Quebec City, nearly 400 miles away."
14,2017-12-29T18:06:46+00:00,texases,"The Giulia has had one of the worst new car rollouts in quite a while. Seems like every site/magazine/etc. has had problems.

But I'm not reading great things about the Tesla 3, either. Time will tell..."
15,2017-12-29T18:26:55+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"The Tesla is critic-proof. It's a cult, really. Short of bursting into flames, every defect on a Model 3 will be artfully apologized for. I'm already seeing this online. It's like the Harley-Davidson or the Apple of EVs.

As critics of the Harley once said: ""It's hard to argue against the success of the brand when its customers have the company name tattooed on their foreheads""."
16,2017-12-29T18:38:41+00:00,stickguy,"I'll consider a Guilia lease in the summer, if they are desperate to unload them. But not a buy. And not if I have to depend on it every day! At least where I am now, there is a dealer close by. Just need to check the areas I may possibly move to."
17,2017-12-29T19:18:01+00:00,qbrozen,"Here is where used RWD Ti models are already. If you look closely, you'll see they were around $33k and change in Nov. Now just 1 mo later they are $30k."
18,2017-12-29T19:30:11+00:00,fintail,"It's a cult to an even deeper extent than Apple products - probably because of the high price, and nobody wants to admit spending that much in a questionable decision. I see Jalopnik today had a funny story about a Model 3 owner experiencing constant hiccups - not long ago, they were shilling for Tesla, and would ban people for mentioning it. How things change, I guess even wikipedia-schooled hipster kidults can see the light.

Time for a MSRP cap on tax breaks for such vehicles."
19,2017-12-29T19:37:33+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"It's difficult to know what actually goes on at the Tesla factory, and the reporting on the Internet gets more and more bizarre.

In a story I read entitled something like ""NEW MODEL 3 NOW LEAVING THE FACTORY"", what it actually was, was drone shots of a fly-over showing a few hundred Model 3s (if that) parked in a row, with one truck loaded up with cars just sitting there.

Keep in mind that Musk was promising ""5,000 cars a week"" by this time.

One would think a normal company would just publish sales figures for the month, instead of the media having to rely on drone fly-overs to speculate where these cars are even going--if anywhere.

It's very odd. Even MORE bizarre was that the story was seriously proposing that this drone shot had effectively silenced all the doubters

Wha?"
20,2017-12-29T19:46:59+00:00,fintail,"The ""Kool Aid"" jokes are kind of trite and cliched, but they kind of apply to this too.

Beta software is often riddled with flaws, cars at launch often have flaws, combine them and have fun."
21,2017-12-30T18:13:05+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I've driven a Tesla Model S and the Chevy Bolt (too briefly to really write it up), so I'm looking forward to a spin in the Model 3. One thing about the Model 3 that I did discover, though--if you want one with all the cool features you can add on, this isn't a $35,000 car. This is closer to a $60,000 car. Even just the autonomous feature costs and extra $8K or so."
22,2017-12-30T23:08:12+00:00,qbrozen,"The $35k is a bit of a joke, IMHO. Oh, you want a color other than black? Cha-ching. You want full performance instead of the detuned version? Cha-ching. People should just go into it assuming $45k as the starting point."
23,2017-12-31T01:46:04+00:00,Michaell,"I thought it was pushing $50K, minimally equipped.

I would think that less than 1% will be equipped at a price point less than $45K"
24,2017-12-31T06:34:36+00:00,qbrozen,$35k base plus $9k high-po version plus $1k for anything other than black paint. Then start adding options from there. Premium pack alone is $5k.
25,2017-12-31T08:55:57+00:00,bhill2,"Ah, brings memories of the ‘60s. “Oh sure we have that model for $1995, but wouldn’t you like a nice heater?  Power steering makes driving so much easier too.  And the available electric wipers are quite useful in this climate. Oh and a radio to keep you company—we have one for $49.95, of course if you want pushbutton station memory it’s a little more...”. And that’s before you consider an optional engine that is capable of actually accelerating the  car. "
26,2017-12-31T17:32:10+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Musk just sold out of 50,000 baseball caps that said ""The Boring Company"" on it. $20 bucks a pop, too. I tell you, this guy has magic fingers.

Remains to be seen if all his ""depositers"" are going to wait 2 years to get a Model 3 or not, and if they will pay full freight once the tax breaks expire (soon) and the options list grows larger.

And then we have all the EV competition coming down the pike right now."

This huge Hadacol Caravan with 17 plush railroad cars loaded with America’s top movie stars and singers is going to have whistle stops and one-night-stands in 15 states, while traveling 3800 miles. All to increase the sales of Hadacol.

Hadacol, of course, is that “cure anything” patent medicine that LeBlanc markets as a vitamin supplement and, according to the Senator, “marches into battle against the pain and suffering of rheumatism, heart problems, ulcers, diabetes, nervousness, gas, cancer” and on and on. You name the medical malady, LeBlanc says, “Hadacol cures it.” Of course, it doesn’t hurt that Hadacol contains 12 % alcohol and has tremendous sales in “dry” areas of the country where one cannot buy liquor– like much of the South. A bottle of wine has about the same alcohol content as this “medicinal” elixir.

So, alcohol? Yes. Taste? No. Hadacol has been described as “smelling like a sewer and tasting like dirt.” Consequently, entertainer Groucho Marx asked its creator, “What is Hadacol good for?” Always the showman, LeBlanc replied, “It was good for five and a half million for me, last year.”

35,2017-12-31T21:34:50+00:00,fintail,"Some Hadacol might make those cars seem like a cooler design.

The dry area stuff is amusing too, hard to believe such backwardness existed in relatively recent history (and to an extent, still does)."
36,2017-12-31T21:36:03+00:00,fintail,"Although the Tesla powertrain is remarkable and has merit, I think there's some power and status involved too, simply based on the price. This is the new Belle Epoque (remember how the last one ended), and ostentatious displays are in again.

The Porsche will just double down on it too, and probably still get an undeserved tax break."

It'll probably buff out as it appears to be transfer from another object, but still.

MB dealer had this cool indoor display for AMG, with simulated tarmac and all. Car is a nicely equipped E63s wagon with a MSRP around 124K, I think:

When I was working I had the responsibility for bringing the ancient records up to date - they were recorded on an old highway map with hand-drawn boundaries colored in when I arrived there - and so I pulled together all the records that I could find since Prohibition ended and had it digitized via a GIS. Then I was in charge of initiating the plebiscites required by law whenever a liquor store or manufacturer wanted to set up in these areas. Every year I petitioned the legislators to change the law, to no avail."

48,2018-01-08T14:24:37+00:00,fintail,I've read some Stingers out there are carrying ADMs. Good luck with that!
49,2018-01-08T17:28:22+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well that's the height of optimism, I must say."
0,2018-01-08T18:12:56+00:00,tifighter,"Well, here you go right here. Where's the shaking my head emoji?"
1,2018-01-08T18:16:58+00:00,andres3,"Wow, the MSRP is already plenty high. I'd rather get a CPO B8/B8.5 S4 in the 20's these days.

Consumer Reports agreed with me that the Sound System is a weak spot in the Optima. Funny how that works. I wonder if they correct that for the Stinger."
2,2018-01-08T18:26:23+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well what else could you possibly buy for $62,000 other than a Kia, I ask you!"
3,2018-01-08T18:42:07+00:00,qbrozen,Truecar says I can get that same car for $205 below MSRP. Just sayin. ;b
4,2018-01-08T18:52:40+00:00,texases,"Well, IIRC the PT Cruiser had ADM when it first came out. I never understood the “gotta have it first” mentality. "
5,2018-01-08T19:25:07+00:00,Michaell,"Well, IIRC the PT Cruiser had ADM when it first came out. I never understood the “gotta have it first” mentality. 

What is it that shifty sez?

Simply an exercise of the dealers First Amendment rights."
6,2018-01-08T19:57:03+00:00,ab348,"Well, IIRC the PT Cruiser had ADM when it first came out. I never understood the “gotta have it first” mentality. 

Same with the Veloster. When they first came out a guy I worked with absolutely had to have one. The dealer took him to the cleaners."
7,2018-01-09T02:20:25+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Stelvio in traffic today, running and driving, so it has that going for it."
8,2018-01-09T02:22:38+00:00,fintail,"Hilarious. Hmmm let's see, I can pay 20% over MSRP or 60+K (which ever seems more ludicrous to you) for a nicely equipped new mild performance Kia from a dealer in Auburn, or get any number of CPO mild or moderate performance cars from prestige brands. Tough decision.

Not knocking the car as an object, but this is very ambitious, and dangerous. Equus and K900 aren't viewed as successful moves."
9,2018-01-09T02:24:47+00:00,fintail,"Yep, percentage wise, it was probably even more. I remember ""Limited"" models approaching 30K with the ADM. It was so bad local dealers were buying cars in Canada and federalizing the gauges, I kid you not.

I also remember 10K ADMs on the Crossfire and SSR."
10,2018-01-09T02:33:52+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"It's a short-lived rush, that's for sure."
11,2018-01-09T02:41:06+00:00,stickguy,"I need to start a list of all the new (or kinda new) cars out I have not had a chance to check out, so I don't miss any at the car show. Off top of the head, there is:

Accord
Alfa Guilia and Stilvio
Ascent (sube)
RDX (not sure if concept or actual production car)
2019 Jetta
Volvo XC60
Stinger

Anything else that should be out, or at least teaser on the turntable, by the end of this month?"
12,2018-01-09T16:24:18+00:00,andres3,I wonder what the lease deal on a $60K Kia is.
13,2018-01-09T16:44:11+00:00,Michaell,"In a word - lousy.

Kia has changed their lease programs to have very high money factors but large amounts of lease cash to offset. Adding $10K ADM just makes the lease payments that much higher."
14,2018-01-10T02:08:40+00:00,fintail,Saw a new unplated A5 sportback in the workplace parking garage.
15,2018-01-10T02:11:07+00:00,kyfdx,"2018 Accord Sport.
Looks good from behind."
16,2018-01-10T02:16:21+00:00,qbrozen,"LOL. Yet, how many times have we all been fooled? "
17,2018-01-11T22:50:04+00:00,stickguy,"a white GLC ""coupe"". Man is that ungainly looking. what a waste, and so much less practical.

And my first Giulia in the wild. Dark blue. Nice looking. Though at first from behind, I thought it was a TLX!"
18,2018-01-12T02:20:23+00:00,fintail,"But those awkward ""coupes"" seem to be selling. BMW discovered a niche, MB decided to get in on it.

I notice most MB illuminated grille stars seem to be on CUV/SUVs, but lately I have seen an E coupe and cabrio with them. What an age we live in."
19,2018-01-12T20:54:53+00:00,ab348,"This is a nice retro throwback to the '70s Chevy pickup:

20,2018-01-12T22:58:19+00:00,qbrozen,"Damn, that's ugly"
21,2018-01-12T23:03:19+00:00,andres3,I'd take it over the Aztec.
22,2018-01-12T23:03:46+00:00,explorerx4,"@qbrozen,
I agree, it worked much better on slab sided trucks. The new ones have too many bulging parts."
23,2018-01-13T05:28:13+00:00,fintail,"Buick Envision, non-rental."
24,2018-01-15T17:39:49+00:00,andres3,"Opposite end of the spectrum, saw a Lambo at that infamous body shop. Looked undamaged and/or already repaired in bright yellow paint.. All Lambo's look too similar to me to tell them apart."
25,2018-01-15T18:45:17+00:00,fintail,"Lambos are somewhat like Audi sedans (and now MB and BMW too) - which might make sense with their ownership. One sausage, different lengths."
26,2018-01-19T15:01:07+00:00,texases,Saw a new 911 Turbo S cabrio on the drive in. $203k to start...
27,2018-01-20T20:55:16+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Leave it to Porsche. You can one-up the Turbo S Cabrio guy by buying the Turbo S ""Exclusive"", a limited-production model staring at $258K. Wait, there's more! At $258K, it *still* has an option list you can check off to go higher."
28,2018-01-20T21:54:07+00:00,explorerx4,"A new Accord in red. Not sure what trim level, but front was not as jarring as the pictures and from the side the roof line just seems long. To me, not a huge difference in looks from 2017."
29,2018-01-20T22:12:19+00:00,stickguy,"really? I think it looks like a stretched Civic, but not really that much like the prior model."
30,2018-01-20T22:37:39+00:00,qbrozen,"Saw a CH-R. Just as ugly in person as expected. My oldest said ""my god, why?!?!"""
31,2018-01-20T22:44:25+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I'm still traumatized from my first sighting, too."
32,2018-01-20T22:55:10+00:00,stickguy,"I saw one today too, parked outside Kohls. so someone must have bought it. Looked even odder in bright teal body with white roof. I pointed it out to the wife and suggested we get one. She just gave me ""the look""."
33,2018-01-20T22:57:40+00:00,fintail,I am surprised by the lack of CH-R I have seen on the road - I rarely see one. I guess PNW drivers want something that's actually AWD. It's like Toyota was trying to compete with the Juke.
34,2018-01-21T00:16:39+00:00,ab348,I saw one here very shortly after it was introduced but the only others I've seen are on dealer lots. I would guess they aren't selling well.
35,2018-01-21T01:26:15+00:00,qbrozen,They should Not Sell well since the Juke was not and is now discontinued.
36,2018-01-21T02:33:06+00:00,explorerx4,"I saw a CH-R once, it reminded of the current Prius, in that it is designed to look like it had body damage right from the factory."
37,2018-01-21T17:59:08+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"They seem to be selling roughly 3,500 a month."
38,2018-01-21T23:16:16+00:00,qbrozen,I think (hope) that will drop drastically quickly once initial demand dries up.
39,2018-01-21T23:56:11+00:00,fintail,"So 41K units a year? Or was that a three month average or something? The amount I see on the road here anyway doesn't seem to match 40K units a year, but they might not sell here due to no AWD on a silly angry-faced faux-aggressive crossover."
40,2018-01-21T23:59:11+00:00,stickguy,"I saw a few at the dealer. The one this weekend was the first I recall in the wild. Might have seen one that did nor register, but 2 tone teal and white top is hard to miss.

saw a pair of new white camrys today. An LE, with a rear end that was fine looking, pretty bland. Then an SE of some sort, with the black accents/diffuser butt that looks a lot flashier (more like a lexus actually). Something for everybody. Saw the nose on the LE. Not good, but looked worse with all the black plastic against a white car. I think this is a car that really needs to be in a dark color."
41,2018-01-22T18:21:21+00:00,andres3,"I've noticed the VW dealership by my work place is full of SUV selection. Probably at least 20 new Tiguans on the lot, maybe 30."
42,2018-01-22T18:28:51+00:00,texases,I'm sure not seeing many of the new Atlas/Tiguans. Kind of surprising.
43,2018-01-22T18:57:23+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"No, not a year. December 2017 was their best month:

44,2018-01-22T19:11:55+00:00,qbrozen,"Hell, I was not even aware it had been out since April"
45,2018-01-22T19:58:10+00:00,fintail,They must be selling in areas to the south of me. I can't recall exactly when I last saw one on the road.
46,2018-01-22T23:23:39+00:00,ab348,I guess anything will sell if it has a Toyota logo on it.
47,2018-01-23T01:00:34+00:00,andres3,"I think Toyota should take your advice and beat Honda at the lawn mower game, and also make snow blowers while there at it. Motorcycles and sport-bikes next!"
48,2018-01-23T02:06:34+00:00,fintail,"Yay, the first automatic sportbike with soft suspension and an aggressive face.

Speaking of bikes, I saw an electric motorcycle (kind of a dual sport style) today."
49,2018-01-28T14:02:23+00:00,explorerx4,Saw a Stinger out front at a Kia dealer. Thought I'd be more wow'ed by it. The was another sedan(Cadenza?) near it that didn't look totally dissimilar.
0,2018-01-28T17:36:13+00:00,fintail,"Stinger looks too much like a prior Optima, IMO. Nice spec sheet, but I don't see this one being a blinding success. Might be a good used deal in a few years.

A local dealer is still trying for a 10K ADM on their loaded model - good luck, all I can say is LOL"
1,2018-01-28T23:12:36+00:00,tifighter,"Grey Tesla Model 3 today. Looks tidy, but the color was pretty bleh on a gray day. But they're getting delivered."
2,2018-01-29T01:02:49+00:00,Michaell,"But, at not anything approaching the rate that was originally forecast."
3,2018-01-29T01:26:46+00:00,fintail,"A friend of mine spotted this tasteful classy subtle thing today, and sent a pic:



In a nice part of Manhattan, so it makes sense. FIRE industry go-getter, old money trust funder, or offshore money launderer, take your pick from the list of boostrapping vocations."
4,2018-01-29T17:30:45+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Went to the Tesla dealer to play with the Model 3 but didn't drive it. Just got a quick demo of features in the parking lot.

I totally hated the driver interface screen. I would get so annoyed driving this car that I'd probably take an ax to it before I got ten blocks to enjoy the rest of it. Having to use + and - on the screen to adjust fan speed? Really? Directional indicators in the middle of the dashboard? Really?

The dash is completely empty. It's a very spartan environment, to say the least.

You know, sometimes ""different' isn't ""better"".

Perfect car for people who find playing with an iPad more fun than driving."
5,2018-01-29T19:02:48+00:00,ab348,"Interesting article in TTAC on the Tesla battery manufacturing woes and the Model 3:

6,2018-01-29T22:57:18+00:00,explorerx4,"@ab348,
After reading the battery story, I spent a lot of time reading the Bullitt article and comments.
BTW my picture is from my favorite part of that movie."
7,2018-01-29T23:49:49+00:00,ab348,The comments on that site usually get a F grade. On that article I give the comments a C- because there are a few that I can agree with.
8,2018-01-30T20:08:28+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Did you read /watch the CNET review of the Model 3? It started off with this line:

""the most anticipated vehicle of all time"".

Either I need to get out more, or they do."
9,2018-01-30T21:39:30+00:00,andres3,"Shoot, I anticipated the $100,000 dollar Dodge Demon more than the Model 3.

I would never buy one for fear of being out-raced by a reliable Prius as my Demon has some type of disabling malfunction. Of course, a demon might be faster than a Prius in LIMP mode.

My Neon didn't have a LIMP mode, that I know of, perhaps it needed one!"
10,2018-01-30T21:41:03+00:00,andres3,I saw one of those Subaru SVX's with the funny glass today. White paint with brassy/goldish rims.
11,2018-01-31T00:27:50+00:00,stickguy,"in a neighbors driveway, a new style Expedition. White. Sharper looking than the old one, but still a real barge."
12,2018-01-31T00:33:41+00:00,kyfdx,"My next door neighbor has a new Suburban.. traded in his Tahoe.

It's yyyuuuuuuggeee!!"
13,2018-02-06T02:13:15+00:00,stickguy,"not sure what year, but merging onto the PA turnpike, a snazzy red Nissan GTR. Sounded good going by.

A Kia Niro, also on the highway. Nie looking in person.

And parked at the supermarket, an Alfa Stelvia"
14,2018-02-06T02:32:49+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Velar today. Haven't seen as many as I once thought, Lexus RX rules that roost here."
15,2018-02-06T03:35:19+00:00,Michaell,"Surprisingly, the Velar is way too expensive for what you get. May be out of the budget for the Stepford wife set in the Pacific NW."
16,2018-02-06T03:38:56+00:00,fintail,"Budgets can be insane here, I think the Model X is still the ne plus ultra of Stepfordmobiles, along with maybe a top spec Range Rover. Maybe they like the Evoque if they want that kind of thing, although that seems like a spoiled co-ed kind of vehicle. One can't turn around without seeing a new style RX here."
17,2018-02-06T03:59:24+00:00,Michaell,Seen any of the RX-L models yet?
18,2018-02-06T04:04:52+00:00,fintail,"I haven't noticed one, but I haven't studied it. I assume it is mostly a rear quarter proportion difference, not sure if they have a badge. When they arrive, I know I will see one. They are seriously everywhere here, and the dealer is just several blocks from where I live."
19,2018-02-07T01:57:35+00:00,fintail,"I mention the lack of Velar yesterday, what do I see today - another Velar."
20,2018-02-08T02:28:18+00:00,fintail,Saw a Quadrifoglio on the road today.
21,2018-02-08T16:06:22+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Pretty pricey at...what.....$75K ? Very nice vehicle, but don't keep it past the warranty period."
22,2018-02-08T16:44:52+00:00,Michaell,"They start in the high 50's, but can go to almost $90K, depending on trim and options"
23,2018-02-08T17:03:47+00:00,fintail,"90K, I'd rather get a nice CPO AMG G-Wagen.

There's something off about the rear quarter view of the Velar. I'd rather have the big boy Range Rover."
24,2018-02-08T17:18:38+00:00,Michaell,"After test riding in one, I would agree with you. The Velar is pretty tight in the rear seat."
25,2018-02-09T02:15:01+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Rolls-Royce Wraith coupe in traffic today - might not be brand new, but uncommon. Also saw that the local Jag/Land Rover dealer has a MB Metris shuttle van."
26,2018-02-10T02:56:54+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Model 3 today. It's a car.

I might have seen two, but I suspect I saw the same car twice (dark blue grey kind of color, dark wheels)."
27,2018-02-10T16:03:03+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Tesla lost 771 million bucks last quarter.
28,2018-02-10T19:11:06+00:00,fintail,"Less than expected, for me anyway."
29,2018-02-10T23:10:23+00:00,stickguy,and the stock price soared. Because sales and gross revenue went up a bunch.
30,2018-02-11T02:02:49+00:00,fintail,"We lose money with every sale, but make up for it with volume."
31,2018-02-11T16:10:39+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Ah, I see. Lose money on every individual sale but make it all up in volume! Of course, how stupid of me not to see that."
32,2018-02-11T22:26:30+00:00,berri,I wonder how these EV batteries will hold up over time in extremely cold or hot climates?
33,2018-02-12T15:17:36+00:00,fintail,"Was at Costco yesterday, and the ""new car"" on display was an Infiniti QX50. With the Lexus LS finally updated, is this the oldest new car still in production? I think it dates back to MY 2007."
34,2018-02-12T15:20:41+00:00,texases,Could well be. Just saw one this morning in the parking lot.
35,2018-02-12T15:21:54+00:00,texases,Edit - what about the Lexus GX 470?
36,2018-02-12T16:03:26+00:00,fintail,"I think the current GX was a MY 2010 debut, definitely an oldie now."
37,2018-02-12T16:11:28+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"A Honda Civic Type R parked right near my house. Naturally I called the police.

I gotta say, in that long row of somewhat anonymous SUVs and sedans, it certainly jumps out at you."
38,2018-02-12T16:55:07+00:00,ab348,"Worst thing is, you can't unsee it."
39,2018-02-12T17:38:34+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Wait, let me close my eyes for a second here.......you know, you're right. I still see it."
40,2018-02-12T18:33:05+00:00,fushigi,Well the QX50 is basically new. New underpinnings courtesy of MB). New engine with first-ever variable compression ratio.
41,2018-02-12T18:45:55+00:00,texases,"That's the 2019 model, not at dealers yet (at least near me, they only have 2017 models). I guess they're skipping 2018."
42,2018-02-12T22:01:30+00:00,laurasdada,"Not new, but a shiny, black Caddy ELR. Good looking car, maybe they could revive/re-price it with a performance-oriented engine and call it a CTS Coupe?"
43,2018-02-12T23:52:41+00:00,fushigi,"The 2019 QX50 has a spring 2018 release planned so yeah, skipping 2018. But coming soon."
44,2018-02-13T16:32:31+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"New Chevy Bolt, being driven by what appeared to be an Oompa Loompa."
45,2018-02-20T18:41:14+00:00,laurasdada,"Egads, a second ELR, in white!"
46,2018-02-20T18:59:03+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"The Electric/Hybrid Cimarron? Man, Cadillac had their nerve putting that price tag on that thing."
47,2018-02-20T19:44:13+00:00,fintail,You can easily find ELRs for under 25K now.
48,2018-02-21T02:27:01+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,They were like..what?....$70K when new? All you got was a Volt with nicer upholstery.
49,2018-02-21T02:27:39+00:00,fintail,"And brash kind of cool styling, to be fair."
0,2018-02-21T02:51:53+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"It was a good looking car, that's very true. But then, what is more of a wasted effort than a car that looks like something it isn't?"
1,2018-02-21T03:04:03+00:00,fintail,"Isn't that the name of the game these days, with so many overstyled or overcladded cars? Even the once-subtle high end brands are in on it."
2,2018-02-21T03:36:39+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well true to some extent. There are ""off-roaders"" you wouldn't dare take off-road, but the ELR is like buying a new Corvette with a Volt engine---not that the Volt isn't a great little car, but not for THAT kind of money."
3,2018-02-21T03:44:42+00:00,berri,"Several years ago I was passed by an ELR. I recall it had 4 tailpipes and an artificial exhaust noise. I guess you really can't get that old time OHV growl out of an OHC engine, so enter electronics"
4,2018-02-21T13:14:28+00:00,kyfdx,That's weird. You sure it wasn't a CTS coupe?
5,2018-02-21T16:30:05+00:00,berri,"No it was one of those squarish Cadillac sports cars that resembled a Corvette somewhat. Maybe it had some other designation, but it was definitely wearing Cadillac badges."
6,2018-02-21T16:36:25+00:00,fintail,"XLR:



Think of it as a Corvette in a fitted suit."
7,2018-02-21T17:27:18+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,ELR:
8,2018-02-21T17:58:59+00:00,kyfdx,CTS Coupe.. I think they look a lot alike..
9,2018-02-21T18:18:52+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Cadillac sure has some baffling nomenclature.
10,2018-02-21T18:21:10+00:00,berri,XLR it was! Odd little thing.

Isn't it great that Caddy learns from it's pricing mistakes on their ""halo"" cars: Allante, XLR & ELR. All stupidly priced. Among whatever shortfalls each may have had..."

16,2018-02-24T03:06:33+00:00,fintail,Someone in my building just turned up in a new TLX A-spec
17,2018-02-24T03:08:19+00:00,stickguy,"the TLX is just a really nice package. Maybe not quite as dynamic driving as some of the Euros, but overall for performance, tech, comfort, and certainly value, hard to beat. Great seats and stereo and really quick, and basically, that is all you really need!"
18,2018-02-24T03:50:59+00:00,fintail,"Lots of value for sure, I think they even lease well. This one is white with black wheels - the latter making it not what I would choose. I wonder how it rides on some of the roads here."
19,2018-02-24T14:12:15+00:00,stickguy,"I did not drive an A Spec like GG and Pens have, but I did try the V6 standard model. Rode and handled just fine, and on 17"" wheels, plenty of sidewall. A good compromise I think."
20,2018-02-24T16:29:55+00:00,fintail,"Unless the highline models have adjustable suspension with a ""comfort"" mode, something with smaller wheels might be more agreeable. It's not a track car."
21,2018-02-25T19:05:19+00:00,fintail,New Costco car today was an XC90 - I didn't look at the sticker as don't care.

23,2018-02-26T00:46:32+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Ford F-150 4X4. I felt like I was parking next to the Lusitania. I could look through my passenger window and read the tire size.
24,2018-02-26T01:05:19+00:00,fintail,I think I've actually seen 2 Cascada.
25,2018-02-26T02:09:17+00:00,qbrozen,Tiny compared to the chromed out F250 dually I saw for sale today by the side of the road.

27,2018-02-26T02:41:26+00:00,stickguy,"I saw a Cascadia on the highway not long ago. Owner what I expected.

F150? Worst for me was when I had the Miata and got next to a Semi on the highway, and was staring at the lugnuts. The bottom ones. Only saving grace is I could probably drive right underneath the darned trailer."
28,2018-02-26T03:03:54+00:00,berri,"I got an F-150 a couple of years ago as a dealer service rental. Didn't want it, but it was the only thing they had available. I was surprised how nicely it rode, but it was awful huge for me. I don't think I was cut out to drive a semi"
29,2018-02-26T15:47:35+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Funniest part was when I got back to my car, the owner of the F150 was ""loading it up""---with one piece of rolled up window screening. I was hoping he'd doff some heavy work gloves and wipe the sweat from his brow. I don't expect we'll be seeing him hauling a bed full of gravel anytime soon. Maybe after that rig gets a few dings."

I was leaning toward a Mini, but you keep reporting problems with yours, so I went with another F150."

Looks a lot more ""squished"" down, and quite a bit like a Pacifica. Making them low and rakish kinda defeats the purpose of a minivan.

and at target, a new Accord parked in the front row. Really noticed this one, in white, because in the spot it just looked enormous."
39,2018-03-02T01:32:35+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Reminds me of those old boom-boxes

43,2018-03-02T15:59:40+00:00,fintail,"Designs meant to intimidate, whether it be the overconfident truck driver or the omnipotent state employee/judge/politico. I am waiting for a resurgence of fascist neoclassic architecture for public spaces any day now."
44,2018-03-02T16:12:56+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I was going to say--that building could have come right out of Albert Speer's playbook. Unlike today's pickup trucks, though, which are designed to enhance the size and power of the driver, these types of neo-fascist architecture are meant to make the individual feel small and insignificant in relation to the power of the state.

Of course, one could argue that modern pickup trucks are also designed to be intimidating."

46,2018-03-02T16:50:41+00:00,ab348,"Locally I am seeing a lot of newish GMC 4x4 pickups that are equipped the same way: a lift kit, oversized wheels and tires and an aftermarket exhaust. Almost always black paint too. It's strange that it is mostly GMCs I am seeing this way - the occasional Ford or Ram but not many by comparison. Perhaps a local dealer has found a market for them modified that way. They certainly do seem intimidating."

0,2018-03-02T21:04:57+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I usually pick California as a bellwether for shifts in buying habits because it is such a huge market. Automakers can't ignore it. If gas prices spike, you can often find really good deals on gas hogs. I think fear works as decisively in the car market as it does in the stock market.

Might boost EV sales, too, which are rather tepid at best."
1,2018-03-02T21:45:09+00:00,fintail,"I think the only plus of price spikes is seeing drivers of large engined gasoline truck and SUVs moan and groan.

With the no doubt huge margins on these cars, I wonder if the makers could absorb some tariff costs, or just pass them on, should stable genius succeed with his witless bluster."
9,2018-03-05T18:41:34+00:00,Michaell,"Just for grins, I went to the website and built my own E63S wagon. I was judicious with the options, and ended up at just over $117K.

If the lottery numbers were ever to hit, I'd be interested. Keep it a subdued color, skip the ""look at me"" black rims, and the only thing to give you away would be the quad exhaust. Total sleeper that would give most supercars a run for their money.

Mustang GT's and Camaro SS's? Leave 'em in the dust."
10,2018-03-05T19:10:07+00:00,fintail,"Depreciation is fun on those, too. Here's one at 6 years old - this one is quite loaded, and I have no doubt was well past 120K when new."
11,2018-03-05T19:31:45+00:00,ab348,"With apologies to J.P. Morgan, if you have to worry about depreciation, you probably shouldn't buy one.

I wonder how it ended up at a Chevy dealer?"
12,2018-03-05T19:51:56+00:00,fintail,"Yep, same thing goes for fuel prices and maintenance in general. The letters ""AMG"" are key.

No plates, I suspect an auction deal. This seller had a rare W211 E63 AMG sedan a few years ago, someone there must seek these cars."
13,2018-03-05T20:07:12+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,You might have to practice first. Mashing a 600 HP gas pedal is tricky.
14,2018-03-05T20:24:26+00:00,Michaell,That I would agree with. Wonder if I could get the Air Force to lend me the use of the runway at Buckley AFB?
15,2018-03-05T20:59:21+00:00,fintail,"For as quick as most MBs depreciate, these sure take their sweet time"
16,2018-03-05T21:23:11+00:00,ab348,"I wish I could understand the attraction of the G-Wagen. For all of its considerable bulk, rear seat legroom does not appear to be its strong suit according to those pics."
17,2018-03-05T21:50:39+00:00,fintail,"I suspect these have but 1-2 occupants 99% of the time. No third row, either.

This thing would have MSRP'd at 155K or so when new, not a huge discount for 3 years."
18,2018-03-05T21:51:27+00:00,qbrozen,"And overpriced at that. $46k max, IMHO"
19,2018-03-05T22:36:00+00:00,fintail,"And with those miles. Now if it had half the mileage, 5K less price, and a different color interior, it would be pushing my buttons, as it appears to be a virtually full option car, and 212s wear white well."
20,2018-03-05T23:46:03+00:00,kyfdx,"I saw my first Tesla Model 3, in the wild (Nashville, in this case).
Not as ugly as the pictures, but not nearly as attractive as the Model S."
21,2018-03-06T01:04:48+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,They really messed up the nose on the Model 3. Looks like an old Panhard.
22,2018-03-06T02:01:00+00:00,fintail,"Nah, this is actually cooler:"
23,2018-03-06T18:28:18+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Panhard makes only armored vehicles now for various militarys around the world.
24,2018-03-06T18:41:34+00:00,texases,"I followed a new Volvo S90 in traffic. Can't say the rear end does much for me, kind of blocky:"
25,2018-03-06T19:00:37+00:00,iluvmysephia1,That Volvo S90 rear end almost calls to mind some late-model Mopar product packaging.
26,2018-03-07T00:45:10+00:00,explorerx4,"I saw this the other day.
Dodge Charger with black rims, not so unusual.
It was painted a green called 'Tank', which I have only seen on Wranglers."
27,2018-03-07T02:01:00+00:00,fintail,"Someone at work has turned up in a new narrow-eyed/Infiniti-eyed SL, unsure of model but not an AMG. Not sure if I am a fan of the new face, as it is really Infiniti-like to me (not knocking Infiniti, but it is just too close)."
28,2018-03-07T13:23:00+00:00,ab348,"That's sort of Olive Drab, ins't it? Was the Charger given a gloss finish or flat?"
29,2018-03-07T13:26:26+00:00,ab348,"Was behind an Alfa 4C coupe in traffic today, the first I've seen here since we don't have an Alfa dealer yet. Was white instead of the typical red color. Raucous exhaust note. Rear window that was clear for maybe the area of a small cookie sheet. Didn't look like it would be fun to drive in city traffic. Certainly stood out though."
30,2018-03-07T21:18:11+00:00,explorerx4,"@ad348,
The paint has a gloss to it, not flat. Works better on a Jeep, not so well on a Charger."

36,2018-03-11T18:20:32+00:00,berri,I think Ford has some product issues and it is not self driving or electrics. They need to get back to what brings in the cash and start dealing with aging product lines.
37,2018-03-14T01:24:56+00:00,fintail,"Saw a recently plated Maserati convertible today, yellow with a black top and kind of beige/tan interior - not my first choices."

39,2018-03-14T03:43:50+00:00,fintail,"I'm happy in my relatively anonymous (especially for this area) E-class, it suits me. I'm not one of those Bellevue-ites.

However, if I was to get an SUV, it would be a G-Wagen. The thought has crossed my mind, especially with the high depreciation floor, and our decaying roads."
40,2018-03-18T23:45:55+00:00,explorerx4,A new Traverse in white. Talk about anonymous.

4,2018-03-23T03:15:56+00:00,fintail,"The LEO seems to blame the driver with maybe just a little well-deserved snark. Good luck blaming the tires. Reminds me of the M4 driver in the viral Youtube video who overcooked it pulling out of a cars and coffee style meet, and blamed tire pressure."

If you want to end up on YouTube get a high-powered 2WD car.

I'm sure someone will now link me to some Audi FAIL videos?"
9,2018-03-23T18:09:12+00:00,qbrozen,"well, as I know you know, no car can defy physics. AWD just means all wheels spinning frantically when you overcome the traction of the tires."
10,2018-03-24T14:31:30+00:00,andres3,"As @Mr_Shiftright stated, ""know your limits"""
11,2018-03-24T18:00:02+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Correct---all AWD does is allow you to accelerate better. It does nothing for ""handling"" or ""braking"" per se, unless the dynamics of acceleration are in play. And once tire limits are met, ain't nothin' gonna save you."
12,2018-03-26T14:53:11+00:00,andres3,"So once you point the car in the right direction, you can accelerate out of trouble better.

I remember the Audi S4's vectoring sport rear diff would argue with you though. That feature definitely gave the heavy car more handling capability to power through turns, if you so choosed to do, but man would you burn up those front tires fast. Sort of a simultaneous under and over-steer situation."
13,2018-03-26T16:44:29+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well, maybe, if acceleration is the right thing to do in the situation, and if your tires permit it. Unlike older AWD, modern AWD cars with all the computer controls are nearly impossible to get into awkward situations, but if you do exceed the car's cornering limits, it's going to be all the harder for most drivers to recover an AWD car."

The Corolla has 168, which is pretty good for the size and probably better for economy. But likely won't be nearly as much fun; I think it'll miss getting the hot hatch designation."

I think Toyota pretty much hit it right out of the park with the new Corolla hatch. The sedan is another story, though I need the info. on that one moreso before I'd even comment on it. One thing odd or even annoying about the '19 Corolla hatch is that Toyota left out Android Auto but includes Apple CarPlay. Humm...Toyota, why did you do that?

If I did get a wild hair one fine day about buying a Toyota Corolla hatchback, I wouldn't let the lack of Android Auto get in the way, however. I notice a whole pallet of other electronic goodies included, including what ought ta be obligatory these days, a USB connection on the dash somewhere."

47,2018-04-16T16:37:06+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Tesla is being rocked lately by some rather unfortunate developments:

1. Based on information from current and former Tesla employees, Kolodny reported that several machine shops in the Fremont CA area are now being tasked with reworking defective parts for the Models S, X, and 3. The article includes photos of large stacks of parts in the yard of one of the machine shops.

2. CoverDrive’s GAAP forecast is for a loss of $648 million in Q3 and $545 million in Q4 of 2018. (note: GAAP is only one way of calculation, and Musk uses another metric).

3. Last year, several plaintiffs filed a lawsuit called Wochos, et al. v. Tesla, Inc., et al. in California federal court. The thrust of the suit is that the defendants knew mass production of the Model 3 during 2017 was impossible, and also knew Tesla could never achieve the rate of 5,000 per week by year end, but all the same stated repeatedly that Tesla would be able to do so. This amounts, say the plaintiffs, to actionable securities fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. (note: There is a petition to make this a Class Action for all Tesla shareholders, but not yet granted).

Nonetheless, Tesla's stock price, while not near the heady days of yesteryear, isn't that far off the mark of this time last year. It is, however, getting beat up today a bit."
48,2018-04-16T17:16:12+00:00,kyfdx,"GAAP

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

In other words... real numbers."
49,2018-04-16T17:29:01+00:00,ab348,"For most of my working career GAAP was gospel. Then suddenly about 8 or 9 years ago it was replaced with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), and another set of standards called ASPE (Accounting Standard for Private Enterprise) also emerged. So they could either be losing money, losing a lot of money, or losing a whole lot of money."
0,2018-04-16T17:29:30+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, the real numbers thingie.

On April 13, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted an acknowledgement that Tesla had over-automated its production lines and underestimated the value of human workers in auto assembly.

"" We had this crazy, complex network of conveyor belts….And it was not working, so we got rid of that whole thing.”

!!!!! Wow, did investors read that?

I think 2018 is the turning point for Tesla. If they can scale up and declare a profit for Q4, then the Tesla dream might actually come true---if not, then I think time has run out.

Yeah, I know the theory that Tesla can keep burning investor cash as long as they keep throwing it at him, but he's losing a half-billion a quarter! That's not chump change."
1,2018-04-16T17:45:54+00:00,kyfdx,"If they have to turn a profit in the 4th quarter, this year, they should just quit now. No chance of that.. not even on an EBITDA basis."
2,2018-04-16T17:49:28+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Tesla is apparently carrying a lot of debt.

Another problem is that his $35,000 Model 3 is actually a $55,000 Model 3 by the time you get it out the door. Tesla isn't building any $35,000 Model 3s at the moment."
3,2018-04-16T17:51:27+00:00,kyfdx,"The biggest problem is: It is an unattractive lump of a car for $50K. Surely, a Tesla could compete in that price range, along with the Kia Stinger?
And, they have the Model S to compare it to, which is a beauty in comparison."
4,2018-04-16T18:02:38+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well I hope it's better in reliability than a Model S. It sure isn't in beauty.

I thought I'd be seeing more Model 3s in the Bay Area here, but I haven't. I've spotted maybe 3 or 4. I see more Ss.

Wall St. says Tesla will need up to $5 billion in new money to continue. A bond issue is out, given the company's existing debt, so it will have to come from a dilutive stock offering.

I'm anxious to see the New Wave of EVs but sometimes I wonder:

Could the entire EV ""thing"" turn into one big bust?

Perhaps the subject of another topic."
5,2018-04-16T18:13:31+00:00,stickguy,"I suspect I represent many people. I would never get a pure EV, but would be just fine with something like a Volt. Heck, I am probably the prototypical buyer for one of those."
6,2018-04-16T18:18:44+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I like the Volt--and you can charge it up on 110V overnight, so in theory if you never drive more than 50 miles a day you will never buy gasoline. And yet, it's got a regular engine if/when you need it. And it's not ugly and doesn't cost $55,000."
7,2018-04-16T19:54:19+00:00,fushigi,"The Volt and other PHEVs make the most sense to me today. I wouldn't rule out a pure EV but think that a lot of charging infrastructure & improvements in battery tech would have to come about before I would take the plunge.

Right now I can go to any gas station and in under 15 minutes be set with 350+ miles of fuel. Until an EV can meet or beat that, or at least come really close, I will only be interested in them at an academic level."

13,2018-04-17T00:51:09+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Why? All you're paying double the MSRP for, is batteries and weight, so you can go 0-60 in 3 seconds rather than 6 seconds (about what a Chevy Bolt can do). The range of the Bolt and the base Tesla S or Model 3 is about the same. (240-ish). You could just buy a Volt and a Mustang GT for the price of a loaded up Model S, and have money left over for a cruise around the world.

There comes a point when EVs become pointless. Most Americans never drive 200+ miles in a day, and there are many affordable gasoline cars that can move out very smartly. An EV is best suited as a metro car and a day-tripper. It excels at that."
14,2018-04-17T01:00:18+00:00,texases,"EVs have somehow acquired this 'salvation of the environment' label. Folks should read a Scientific American article a few years ago about how that's not true, when compared to regular hybrids, in about half the US. And that's just on a CO2 emissions basis, ignoring the battery costs ($$ and environmental). This is because of the CO2 from coal-powered electricity."

At least $5K more than the Yaris it is based on, with almost the same MPG (just a few more), and from peeking inside, not nearly as much interior room compared to a full-size Prius. ???"
20,2018-04-17T02:38:14+00:00,qbrozen,"Oh I dont mean the top spec. I was thinking more like a base Model 3. If they would make the Volt as quick as the Bolt, that would be pretty close. "
21,2018-04-17T02:49:39+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, the Bolt is about 2.5 seconds faster than the Volt, 0-60, and about the same as the Model 3 base model.

Really, fast acceleration costs a lot of money in an EV. And given the Volt's short EV range, of only 50 miles, you'd use up your yippies pretty fast I'd imagine."

I know someone else with one, too, but they are a cheapskate wanting the most economical (yet reliable) transportation possible, and they drive the doors off it."

These cars are very large. Very low too. The center console is Taurus-wide. The rear legroom is limo-like. Some had the bright chrome unibrow up front which looked a little garish while others had it in a black chrome finish which was a little better. Flashy wheels on all of them. The Sport models all had black cloth upholstery and their interiors looked rather cave-like. There was a single Touring model there with an ivory leather interior which looked far better than another one with black leather. I believe it was also the only one there with the 2.0T engine. I wonder just how well these will sell compare to the previous models. I think they are just too big. The lot inventory seemed to be about 90% Civics and CRVs."

Also looked at the first new Buick Regal I've seen and was less impressed. Looks are kind of awkward and the seats in this one looked cheap with cloth inserts. Disappointed."
49,2018-04-26T03:38:45+00:00,andres3,"And you never paid $40K or $50K for a Kia before either. I think the Stinger will languish. But only the sales will tell the true story.

Have your Kias been cheap to maintain, or do you avoid dealerships?"

Regarding the Regal, this is more weirdo GM model positioning. The Insignia is not a particularly premium product in the home market, rather just a nice larger car - think of it as a German Impala rather than competing with near-lux. GM has been trying to sell the large Opel as a premium offering here, off and on for more than 20 years now, with marginal success."

7,2018-04-27T05:57:10+00:00,andres3,"I drove a RWD GT, it drove well, but the interior was a let down in my opinion. There were some design ideas I didn't like, such as the tiny rear window with a tiny rear view and rear-view mirror to go with it.

Kia is good at imitating the real thing, but it's still not the real thing. They are not quite ""there"" yet."
8,2018-04-27T10:57:56+00:00,qbrozen,"Except you'd have to compare to A6 size.
Tough to compare properly performance-wise since the Kia falls in between the a6 3.0T and S6."
9,2018-04-27T15:24:41+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Reviewers seem to harp on the ""value"" aspect of the Stinger--the features and performance you get at that price point. You can certainly ""beat"" the Stinger's features with a German sedan, but you'll pay another $10K to do it, is the point I think.

It might be analogous to when the first Lexus LS came out. It's true it was ""no Mercedes"" but it was close enough to sell at the lower price."
10,2018-04-27T15:52:54+00:00,ab348,"Well, the Stinger seems to be glued to the pavement on most dealer lots. Something must not be resonating with buyers, either the price tag for the brand name or the perception of quality received for the price. I suspect the large size probably does it no favors either."
11,2018-04-27T16:44:05+00:00,qbrozen,"I'd guess ""it's a Kia"" for one, and the other being that 95% of buyers have no idea why it is quite a bit more expensive than the virtually same-sized Optima sitting next to it.

I would imagine that is at least part of the reason why other manufacturers chose to split off a separate division. Nissan would probably never have had the success with the G35 they had if it were sitting next to the Maxima."
12,2018-04-27T17:00:45+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yep, it's the ""Kia"" badge. It's like with the Tesla Model 3 vs. the Chevy Bolt. With that bowtie on the front, the Bolt just isn't attracting the EV cult, even though it is a match for the Model 3 in most respects, at a much lower price point.

I think the Bolt is selling fairly well, but there's certainly no ""buzz"" about it."
13,2018-04-27T18:14:28+00:00,stickguy,"driving around, a new Accord. Distinctive tail end. Reminds me of some expensive car. just not sure which.

and in the showroom, a Hyundai Kona. Liked it!"
14,2018-04-27T20:08:15+00:00,Michaell,"Not just ""it's a Kia"" but also ""It's a Kia dealer"". Product may be great in so many ways, but the perception from the majority of the public is that Kia is where the credit challenged go, when all else fails.

Upgrade the facilities (which, has happened to the Kia dealer closest to me), and the buying process, and you might change the perception. Gonna take time, however."
15,2018-04-27T20:33:38+00:00,stickguy,I refuse to step foot in either Kia dealer near me. The hyundai stores are fine.
16,2018-04-27T21:42:44+00:00,ab348,Around here it is just the reverse. One of the Hyundai dealers in particular is about as bad as they get.
17,2018-04-27T22:02:50+00:00,qbrozen,I have never been to a Kia dealer. Tried Hyundai once and would never go back there.
18,2018-04-27T23:41:28+00:00,tjc78,"I bought my Genesis and Elantra at Burns.  No complaints with either purchase.   I’ve been treated worse at other dealers, that’s for sure. "
19,2018-04-27T23:45:17+00:00,stickguy,"Burns and the places in PA I used (particularly Faulkner) were really nice. Clean, friendly, honest. Everything you want in a car dealer really."
20,2018-04-28T01:15:59+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new Navigator this afternoon, definitely has a Range Rover look to it."
21,2018-04-28T01:48:43+00:00,stickguy,"I saw a new one too recently. Big imposing beast, but nicely styled for something in that class. Needless to say, the couple driving it looked wealthy!"
22,2018-04-28T02:32:06+00:00,qbrozen,I didn't mean all Hyundai dealers. Just the one I went to.
23,2018-04-28T16:13:31+00:00,explorerx4,"a black Ford Ecosport - looks like a jacked up Fiesta, which it is or a smaller version of a C Max.."
24,2018-04-28T17:45:09+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,
25,2018-04-28T19:20:31+00:00,tjc78,"Gotcha.  

Hell, there are plenty of sleazy dealers for every brand.  "
26,2018-04-28T20:52:16+00:00,explorerx4,"When I bought my truck, the salesman tried to interest my wife in an Ecosport.
Little did he know she drives an MKC.
We kind of felt it was a bit stereotypical."
27,2018-04-30T16:50:40+00:00,laurasdada,A Bentley Bentayga. Meh.
28,2018-04-30T17:01:32+00:00,stickguy,Quite a few new style odyssey. Minivans not totally dead I guess
29,2018-04-30T17:02:25+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Honda really knows how to do ""minivan""."
30,2018-05-01T01:10:38+00:00,fintail,"Saw a couple of Model 3 today, meh. Also saw an E300 with distronic - rare option.

I've also noticed more Velar lately - either lease deals are picking up, or more proof I live in Stepfordville."
31,2018-05-01T01:20:36+00:00,texases,"Thought I had pulled up next to a collision-damaged car with wavy bodywork...nope, just a Lexus NX300..."
32,2018-05-01T13:31:15+00:00,ab348,"Positive review of the upcoming Toyota Corolla hatch. Maybe something for @iluvmysephia1 to consider.

https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/auto/2019-toyota-corolla-hatchback/preview/"
33,2018-05-01T18:23:16+00:00,stickguy,"something else that sounds nice is the next RAV4. the review I read last night made it sound like a vast improvement. If I had to wade back into the family car market soon, that would now be on the list along with the CRV. The current version RAV would not even warrant a test drive."
34,2018-05-01T18:39:31+00:00,texases,"Yeah, current Rav4 is very 'meh'. I'll look at the new one in hybrid form to replace my MKZ hybrid."
35,2018-05-01T18:45:14+00:00,stickguy,"the hybrid is interesting. But the standard engine will probably do pretty well on it's own, for less money."
36,2018-05-05T21:43:19+00:00,explorerx4,Drove by a Kia dealer today. They had a yellow Stinger sitting out front. Not my color. Not an unattractive car. Rear overhang seems very long.
37,2018-05-06T00:40:50+00:00,fintail,Spotted a white (pearl maybe) Stinger and another Model 3 today - production must have actually ramped up.
38,2018-05-06T03:52:26+00:00,Michaell,"I think I saw my first model 3 today, going the other way on a 6 lane arterial road. I wasn't terribly impressed with the exterior; have to see the inside to render full judgement."
39,2018-05-06T04:04:29+00:00,qbrozen,"Still have not seen a Model 3.
Got another look at a Stinger today. Red GT AWD with a bad driver. In any case, I really like the look of the rear. Probably its best angle."
40,2018-05-06T04:18:36+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Incredibly spartan.
41,2018-05-06T19:47:19+00:00,fintail,"I think the Model 3 is definitely a case of buying a powertrain and getting the rest for free. Other Teslas have interiors that are far from what is expected in their price class, for this one, you get seats and a steering wheel and feel thankful for that."
42,2018-05-07T00:46:54+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"The Model 3's interior reminds me of something like an entry-level luxury Japanese trim at the base level. However, the interior is nicer than a Chevy Bolt. On the other hand, at about $20K more ""out the door"" than the Bolt, it should be."
43,2018-05-08T01:17:38+00:00,fintail,"New car day . In my building's parking garage a new style Jeep 4 door and a new Impreza Sport have appeared in the past 24 hours. On the road I spotted a new X6M, recently plated E63S wagon, matte grey 760Li (not my first color choice), and a co-worker got a new Outback."
44,2018-05-11T18:03:04+00:00,laurasdada,Atomic Silver Lexus LC500. Still sleek.
45,2018-05-11T19:02:21+00:00,stickguy,"street parked in a local neighborhood (older, cheesy houses) a white Continental. Might be the first one I saw in the wild. Did not realize how prominent the door handles are. weird how much they protrude. Not bad looking overall though."
46,2018-05-12T00:20:30+00:00,stickguy,"probably one of the first civilians to do so, but got to check out a new 2019 RDX. Had a call from the guy at the dealership (I had done the online ""keep me informed""thing). Called a few days ago to say they would be here mid-June. Got another call this afternoon telling me they have a couple on hand until tomorrow afternoon (they are going to an American Honda corporate office, I assume for demo purposes). But if I got there first, they would show it to me. Just no drives.

so stopped after dinner. Sadly, they closed at 6 (I thought they were open to 9). But, I drove around back, and found them. A red standard one, and a white A Spec with snazzy red seats.

overall, I liked it. looks good in person. Stylish. Seems to be bigger in the trunk area than ours. Interior is quite a bit more fancy. Will be interested in getting into it next month."
47,2018-05-12T22:50:31+00:00,berri,"So what is this blob of a big Mercedes 4 dr that looks like it is sitting on stilts. Seen several recently and they were all white with black trim... I'm guessing some kind of 4wd sedan/crossover, but with a trunk?"
48,2018-05-13T00:39:13+00:00,fintail,Maybe a GLE coupe? Perfect for the X6 driver who lacks the flamboyance required by the modern roundel:
49,2018-05-13T11:24:21+00:00,tjc78,"So what’s plan Z? Sell the sport to your daughter, lease a new RDX for the wife and take the hand me down RDX for you?"
0,2018-05-13T12:14:22+00:00,stickguy,"that plan is on the list someplace. Probably would not happen right away, so would need to be some interim filler plan!

Would just be a lot easier to send her off on her own and keep what we got. Just less fun!"
1,2018-05-13T14:37:33+00:00,tjc78,"I know I may be banned for this but saw what appeared to be a fully decked out Camry SE in charcoal grey.  I thouhht it looked pretty sharp except for the front. 

I may have to test drive one to see how it is.  "
2,2018-05-13T15:02:05+00:00,berri,"Yep Fintail, that's it"
3,2018-05-13T15:03:23+00:00,berri,"If you don't mind the low to the ground profile and somewhat tight headroom, you should. People may mock Camry's, but they are well made, comfortable riding and durable."
4,2018-05-13T15:40:24+00:00,stickguy,"I agree. There is one like that (I think it is actually very dark blue though) I walk past daily with the dog. It is always pulled nose into a driveway. Side and rear profile are nice.

The nose, depending on model and color, is livable. The part I disliked actually was the interior (dashboard mostly, particularly on the passenger side).

No clue how it drives, but the road test reports were positive. Assuming they are blowing out cheap, certainly worth a look."
5,2018-05-13T17:16:17+00:00,kyfdx,I like the new Camry look better than the Accord.
6,2018-05-14T15:26:43+00:00,andres3,"Have they improved the interior?

I was disappointed in Toyota's Camry interior when looking at mid-size cars for my Mother. The Avalon interior is more along the lines of the New Accord Interior quality."
7,2018-05-14T20:56:47+00:00,explorerx4,"Somebody find a good review of Entune.
I find the Camry's shift and electronics frustrating."
8,2018-05-14T21:58:32+00:00,kyfdx,"Our Tacoma has it.. my son hates it.

I don't bother with it."
9,2018-05-15T22:11:25+00:00,explorerx4,"In the parking lot at work, a black Lincoln Continental.
Then I noticed it had out of state Livery plates.
I guess out parking lot security guard fell asleep."
10,2018-05-16T01:23:11+00:00,fintail,"I'm noticing a lot more new style Camry on the road lately, including some of the flamboyant 2 tone high models. Looks OK from the side anyway."
11,2018-05-16T13:24:41+00:00,berri,They are dealing and looking at Honda lots I think Accord is going to have to dig deeper soon too.
12,2018-05-17T01:15:14+00:00,fintail,"Saw a couple more Model 3 today, don't think I have seen one with front plates yet - I am sure those will be another one where laws don't apply, like other Teslas (but I pity the fool in a dirty old car who drives without a front plate)"
13,2018-05-17T18:50:39+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"If you drive without a front plate in Berkeley, CA, they will ticket you right in a parking lot."
14,2018-05-18T01:26:01+00:00,fintail,"Around here I have little doubt there's an inverse relationship between vehicle price and plate enforcement.

Saw an oddity today, a new GLS63, with a European front plate mount (and no plate). I wonder if people do European delivery on a car built in Alabama, or if Euro delivery cars even have that hardware. Weird."
15,2018-05-21T18:50:53+00:00,kyfdx,My first Bentley Bentayga.. and a Lexus LC 500
16,2018-05-21T22:16:20+00:00,laurasdada,"My first Tesla Model 3, visiting LA. Red, not overly distinctive. Not nearly as handsome as the S."
17,2018-05-21T22:35:06+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"The Model 3 certainly doesn't look like $55,000."
18,2018-05-21T22:42:24+00:00,texases,"Just wait - you'll be able to spend $78,000 on a dual motor Model 3, Musk compares it to an M3..."
19,2018-05-21T23:46:25+00:00,Michaell,You'll always remember your first....
20,2018-05-21T23:53:45+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I don't think Tesla buyers realize that the faster an EV goes, and the longer it goes fast, the slower it gets.
There's a reason why Formula E races are only about 50 minutes long.

So this Uber Alles Model 3 might very well outdrag an M3, but it's going to be passed soon enough on the road as speeds climb."
21,2018-05-22T00:07:16+00:00,berri,"Plus, as rechargeable batteries age from use they generally tend to hold less charge over time. Don't know if there is enough history on this with tesla though."
22,2018-05-22T00:28:15+00:00,laurasdada,"Lotus Evora convertible, Alfa Giulia Qudrafoglio"
23,2018-05-22T01:10:12+00:00,fintail,"I saw a Model 3 too, white. As these early run cars are all apparently loaded in the 55K range, I don't know if it looks or feels the price. Maybe the best case yet of Tesla being one where you buy the powertrain and the rest is considered a free gift."
24,2018-05-22T01:30:22+00:00,explorerx4,My wife saw a Bentayga today. She described it as an SUV with a big 'B' on it.
25,2018-05-22T04:19:56+00:00,laurasdada,"Now I've seen three MOdel 3s, two white. My brother is thinking of an electric, I suggested perhaps a pluging hybrid. He seems intrigued. Living in LA, he believes that there are charging outlets everywhere, and usually in prime parking locations."
26,2018-05-22T12:23:42+00:00,kyfdx,Exactly
27,2018-05-22T12:24:58+00:00,ab348,"That will become interesting as sales of EVs grow. Just like now where on-street parking is highly sought-after in some areas, I can foresee a time where all of those charging spots that are now mostly unused become highly prized and people start pulling shenanigans to obtain/keep access to them. Meanwhile other EV owners who get shut out from charging access are subjects of ""victim"" stories in the media detailing their tales of woes, with calls for govt to do more to help them."
28,2018-05-22T18:29:13+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Ford is planning to sell a 300 mile EV crossover in 2020, so the heat is on!

Not sure about Tesla. They are still losing 60 million dollars A DAY!"
29,2018-05-22T21:40:50+00:00,qbrozen,I plan on selling a 700-mile EV that does 0-60 in 3.5 secs and seats 7. Who wants to make a deposit?
30,2018-05-22T23:42:03+00:00,berri,"Saw my first new Continental on the road. Hard to describe the color, kind of beige light mocha maybe. Liked it from the rear the best. I thought the C pillar had maybe a bit of Mercedes styling hints and the trunk lid and rear maybe a bit of BMW in it with some Lincoln unique. The side and front didn't seem as attractive for me at least. As Lincoln goes, I think the new Navigator (of which I've seen several out there) is pretty sharp and it looks like that will extend down to the upcoming Aviator."
31,2018-05-23T04:57:16+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, but are you going to Mars, too? Bet not!

That's going to be one very expensive EV with that 700 mile range. Tell your engineers to cut that range in half--it's overkill."
32,2018-05-24T06:10:32+00:00,laurasdada,Will you also be selling a bridge in Brooklyn to park said EV under?
33,2018-05-24T10:45:32+00:00,qbrozen,You can only lease the bridge. But it includes insurance and you can upgrade to a bigger bridge after just 12 mos.
34,2018-05-24T13:54:29+00:00,fintail,"All we really need is a 400 mile real world (AC use, 75 mph cruising, etc) range, 0-60 in 8 seconds, seats 5, and normal styling. Maybe the ability to charge in a short time too - charging tech is still a huge stumbling block, when I can replenish my 800 mile diesel range in under 10 minutes."
35,2018-05-24T17:48:43+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Nobody is going to build that. The # of people who need to go 400 miles in a day is microscopic, and the major expense in building an EV is the batteries. I suppose you could build some $250,000 SUV plush monster that would do that for people in Dubai.

Maybe in 10 years that would be possible at an affordable cost, presuming there is an earth left to drive on, of course."
36,2018-05-24T17:57:54+00:00,fintail,"It's a stumbling block for me. I take some road trips every year, and I don't want to have to stop for half an hour or more every 200 or so miles (range with real world higher speed driving and/or range anxiety).

Battery tech is indeed the issue. That, and I want something with normal styling and build quality. Until then, the diesel hybrid possible in more refined markets is the best answer."
37,2018-05-24T18:05:14+00:00,tifighter,A 30 minute stop every 200 miles is fine with me. For the same reason I get an aisle seat on long flights or have a standing desk at work. Just say no to a DVT.
38,2018-05-24T18:16:21+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"That's a very tall order, for 400 miles at 75 mph with AC or Heat on full blast. That would probably mean a ""marketing range"" of 600 miles--that is, optimum miles under ideal conditions (urban, low speed, no hills, no HVAC, mild temperatures)."
39,2018-05-24T18:21:48+00:00,qbrozen,I'm still accepting deposits.
40,2018-05-24T18:36:27+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,What about Mars? Are we all going to Mars?
41,2018-05-24T20:42:27+00:00,qbrozen,my lawyers and financial advisors forbid me from talking about that project in the same forum as the electric car project. Go figure.
42,2018-05-24T20:48:04+00:00,fintail,"I can't imagine driving to Medford or Missoula or something and stopping for a minimum of an hour (if you can get an open space and charge up immediately, real world would probably be 90 minutes or 2 hours). Normally, I will stop every 250 miles or so for a washroom break and/or fuel, if needed. Unless I am on a secondary road and am enjoying the scenery, the destination is important."
43,2018-05-24T21:53:02+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"You could probably buy the EV that fits your particular needs, in 5-10 years, but you'll be paying a hefty price for it. Automakers build the cars that they can make a profit on, not the cars that necessarily suit every type of buyer.

For instance, the public didn't demand FWD, it just got it.

And manual transmissions are going away because it doesn't pay to develop a transmission for those 2-3% of buyers."
44,2018-05-24T22:44:16+00:00,ab348,Do they have better battery tech there?
45,2018-05-25T01:04:15+00:00,tjc78,Faster chargers....
46,2018-05-25T01:51:49+00:00,fintail,"I guess I will have to stick to my liquid fuel vehicle, woe is me, 800 miles on a charge.

I've seen ads from the 70s and 80s with FWD as a selling point, for snowy weather traction."
47,2018-05-25T03:14:11+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"FWD has better traction unless you are going uphill--then, not so much.

A Tesla Model S should be regarded as a full-size Lexus with a 9 gallon gas tank and wider panel gaps and one dealer every 100 miles."
48,2018-05-25T05:34:02+00:00,laurasdada,"I spotted two Karma Revero's today. Also, Bentayga's, while not common, aren't uncommon here in LA. A couple of DB11s, but don't think I've yet seen an LC500 (or H) here."
49,2018-05-25T07:39:51+00:00,bhill2,"There has been considerable discussion about overcoming the disadvantages of range limitation and recharge time in electric vehicles. In general, the consensus is that significantly longer range and faster charging is years away and likely to be expensive. Consider also that most electricity is generated using fossil fuels anyway.

Please let me present a half-baked idea for potential further baking. It has already been shown that electric cars can be produced at moderate price that have good performance and adequate range for most driving. Would there be any play in adding, or even replacing some of the battery capacity with, an internal-combustion engine optimized to run at constant speed and drive a generator? That is, a parallel hybrid. It should be a fairly simple addition, and I would think that the optimized engine could be made very low in emissions. It would have to be able to maintain battery charge under normal situations, but in most driving not a lot of power is needed. Under high power requirements the battery would be drawn down a bit, but recharging could take place when the power demand goes back to normal. Discuss among yourselves."
0,2018-05-25T10:05:55+00:00,benjaminh,"I saw a Honda Clarity plug-in hybrid when I was getting an oil change for my Accord at the dealer. Strange looking, but sort-of cool. Doesn't quite work for me, styling-wise. Slightly reminds me of a Citroen DS...."
1,2018-05-25T10:08:41+00:00,benjaminh,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I think the Accord Hybrid I'm considering buying sort of does what you are talking about....?"
2,2018-05-25T10:25:00+00:00,qbrozen,"That is a Volt, yes?

edit: just looked it up. The original 2011 Volt worked that way for the most part, but the 2016 redesign changed it to be more of a blended power delivery once the battery ran down.

the i3 range extender only charges the battery, right?"

4,2018-05-25T15:09:09+00:00,berri,Gasoline will be in for a price jolt so to speak when the much higher octane fuel becomes required for new vehicles down the road. Wait and see the oil and gas station industry gouge.
5,2018-05-25T15:30:07+00:00,texases,"Gouge? It costs more to make. Basically, the car industry wants us to pay (with higher gas prices) for them to make their mpg targets."

7,2018-05-25T15:54:30+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well people are still buying the Model 3, so apparently what Consumer Reports says doesn't blunt the charisma of the Fearless Leader.

Maybe they're using Land Rover as a model for this level of blind faith. Some people want what they want--reliability isn't the highest priority."
8,2018-05-25T21:06:43+00:00,explorerx4,"Saw my first 'without a doubt about it' Model 3 today.
It was moving and didn't see anything fall off, going kind of slow though.
It was black and had a temporary paper plate.
I think that makes sense because I don't think they are for sale in CT."

You mean to tell me that premium fuel costs 60 cents or more a gallon to produce compared to regular 87 octane??? Now I can't tell you whether it is the industry, wholesalers or gas stations that are exaggerating this price differential."
10,2018-05-26T00:42:41+00:00,texases,"If it didn't cost more, somebody would charge less. Look what happened to gas prices when they plummeted. Demand for premium also is creeping up as more folks buy turbo cars that recommend/require premium.

If gas sellers could set their price where they wanted, why'd they let regular prices drop?"

12,2018-05-26T02:49:02+00:00,fushigi,"Put a supercapacitor at the charging station and feed it at a sustainable rate. Let it dump the high-current flow into the EV batteries. For commercial chargers the capacitor may need to be oversized or part of a bank of units to handle the demand. For residences or small businesses it would be around the size of Tesla's Powerwall.

But there is still an issue: heat. Dumping that much juice into the EV battery pack quickly creates a lot of waste heat. It has to be managed or you wind up with bulging/exploding battery cells or otherwise shortening the useful life."

Bentley's a go go including the Bentayga
A fistfull of Ferraris, including Italias and FFs
Late sightings of Lexus LC500, 3 today
Lexus RX300s
A bunch of Aston Martins, DB9, Vantage and DB11
A dime a dozen 911s

You know, the usual."
14,2018-05-26T06:50:05+00:00,bhill2,"That is a Volt, yes?

edit: just looked it up. The original 2011 Volt worked that way for the most part, but the 2016 redesign changed it to be more of a blended power delivery once the battery ran down.

the i3 range extender only charges the battery, right?

I had forgotten the i3 range extender; it may indeed do that. All of the hybrids I am aware of are parallel, so that the engine is often used to propel the car. That requires that the engine be designed to operate at a range of speeds. Since electric propulsion can now provide more than sufficient power on its own, I was hoping that being able to operate the engine at a constant, or limited range of speed for recharging only would allow optimization for low emissions and fuel consumption while still giving greater range and short refueling times."
15,2018-05-26T16:33:31+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,I'm kind of surprised that BMW was able to sell any i3s. You get very little value for your money.
16,2018-05-26T19:19:11+00:00,fintail,"i3 resale is hilarious, lease it, don't buy it."
17,2018-05-26T19:55:30+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Sheer madness to buy one.

19,2018-05-27T05:43:40+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well sure, that's the only way to unload them. If the leases were as bad as the MSRP, they wouldn't sell a single one I'd guess. Next to the Smart Car, this has got to be the most ridiculous vehicle in the marketplace today."
20,2018-05-27T12:20:19+00:00,qbrozen,"Ok now I'm curious. What makes you say that? Why is it more ridiculous than a Leaf, for example? I think the range extender makes the i3 a pretty reasonable appliance, putting aside the homeliness of it, of course."
21,2018-05-27T12:24:56+00:00,texases,"Nothing BMW about it. Dumpy/odd looking, nothing special as to performance or handling. Why buy it over a much cheaper Leaf?  The range extender adds about 100 miles, right?  Not enough to matter, it seems, especially because it was an option.  Seemed like a bandaid. "
22,2018-05-27T12:34:20+00:00,qbrozen,But the point more to the range extender is that you can fill with gas and keep going. 
23,2018-05-27T15:53:58+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, but it's almost $50,000 dollars!!! For what? Looks? Handling? Performance?

Nope. Ain't got any of those things.

Next to the Cadillac ELR, probably the worst automotive value of the 21st century, IMO."

Then I see a white Model S. 3 tires on the pavement and one on the lawn kind of ruined it."
28,2018-05-29T00:32:17+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Maybe his extension cord was too short?

The US just reimposed tariffs on imports of Canadian aluminum and steel (also ones from Mexico) and the Canadian gov just responded with tariffs on imports of a whole laundry list of US products, from frozen pizza to toilet paper to bourbon.

All of this apparently started because the US gov was unhappy with the time taken to get a NAFTA deal. Up here in Canada both the pols and the citizenry are justifiably P.O.ed at the US gov after all the support we provided after 9/11, in Afghanistan, etc etc."

This is all political theater. If a critic thinks a deal is ""bad"", that critic should be able to explain why it's bad. That way, we're all in on it.

Perhaps it turned out ""bad"" but I don't think all parties went in thinking it was bad."

13,2018-06-02T13:31:05+00:00,ab348,"It's a brand-new design for 2018, available in a large hatchback or a wagon in the USA. Canada only gets the hatchback sedan, called a ""Sportback"". The 2018 is bigger than the previous model with worse styling and a cheapened-up interior if you do not go for the top-line trims. The one I saw had remarkably ugly cloth-and-vinyl seats. From all reports they drive well but so did the previous model like the one I had, which looked far better IMO. They have virtually no presence in the market here. The one I saw was a special order that the dealer brought in for someone, but they do not carry any inventory of them locally."

It is one thing to hype and sell the car, it is another to act elitist and arrogant, so I get that issue. Still, if it is really bad, you could ask to take a test drive alone. They may say no, but that ATS will probably be enough to earn some respect; don't drive up in a hooptie!

As to the 2nd perception issue, have you ever driven a GTI and A3 back to back? Even better, drive an AWD Audi, you really won't remember what FWD is when you do. While the A4 is available with FWD, the Audi AWD tends to be rear-biased now, 60%, and more proactive than reactive.

I get the complaints about the older Haldex and other AWD systems being FWD except when AWD is needed. The previous generation TL - SH-AWD I drove was sort of that way. The best modern (last 2 years at most for Haldex-based systems) AWD systems solve that problem, at least in dynamic mode. Could just be faster reacting sensors and smarter computers at work, but I think the rear-biasing gives a different feel."

4,2018-06-14T05:10:00+00:00,Michaell,"4Matic = AWD, in MB speak"
5,2018-06-14T13:36:36+00:00,fintail,"MB has used the term 4Matic since around 1986. MB hasn't had a 4 speed auto in this market since around 1992/3, I believe."
6,2018-06-14T20:34:24+00:00,andres3,"Funny, Dodge used a 3-speed in my '95 Neon, and did so for many years after that. Should have argued with my father longer about getting the 5-speed manual. Would have saved a thousand dollar transmission rebuild at 60K, and clutches cost less then that. Also would have made me half a second faster to 60 probably."
7,2018-06-14T22:04:15+00:00,stickguy,Spending a long weekend in Saratoga. Lots of money and nice cars. Passed an MB AMG wagon in burnt orange on the thruway. Doing 65 on he thruway. And a new same color e class convertible in town. THat I liked
8,2018-06-15T10:53:38+00:00,tjc78, Shame it’s too early for the race track (horses) 
9,2018-06-16T01:55:31+00:00,stickguy,Harness is running. We went to listen to a bar band instead.
10,2018-06-23T17:26:04+00:00,fintail,"Had the Bluetec in for the yearly service this morning, browsed the showroom while I was waiting. Highlight was a loaded E63S sedan, over 30K in options, MSRP ~135K. Beautiful pearl white finish, boring black interior, but the option load was impressive even for an AMG. It had the acoustic glass package, which seems to be rare. Depreciation is not going to be nice to that car, however, build quality was immense, a jewel. They also had a Mauritius Blue (fairly bright) G63, around the same price as the E63 - fun quirk I just noticed is that these have the old fashioned non-aero wiper blades, a loaded C63S cabrio MSRP 94K - so after tax and if you were goofy enough to pay MSRP, you'd be over 100K for a C-class, nice. Also moderately optioned E400 coupe at 74K, CLA45 AMG at 60K, GLC43 AMG at 73K, and some other more normal cars."
11,2018-06-24T18:55:32+00:00,fintail,"I've seen a few more Clarity on the road. So weird, but somehow I don't hate it. Along with the new Accord, it almost reminds me of some kind of parallel universe Citroen, oddball and French."
12,2018-06-24T20:24:29+00:00,berri,"I liked a lot of Citroen styling, but then I didn't own one or have to work on it"
13,2018-06-24T22:44:01+00:00,fintail,"I think modern ones are better, but maybe not to Honda standards.

I went car looking again today, BMW-Audi-Jag. Lots of interest in the Velar at the LR/Jag dealer, I saw a few test drives in action. They had a couple Jag wagons in stock, prices in the 70s, otherwise, the expected fare. BMW had a diesel 3er and a few ""e"" series cars, along with a host of X2 and other CUVs, and normal cars. Audi had an S5 sportback that caught my eye, and I noticed a diverse assortment of assembly locations - a few in Germany along with Slovakia, Spain, Mexico."
14,2018-06-26T15:33:10+00:00,texases,"I followed one of these in to work today. Made me think of some over-styled late '50s car. Maybe what Mercury would have made, had CUVs been a thing back then..."
15,2018-06-28T01:07:15+00:00,fintail,Saw a new GLE63 coupe with the vertical grille bars. It's a....look.
16,2018-06-29T14:24:52+00:00,fintail,"I seem to notice at least 10 new Camry for every new Accord around here. I know rentals are some part of it, but still."
17,2018-06-29T14:29:31+00:00,texases,Same here. I'm guessing the Accord's styling (and resulting bad visibility) turned off some of the 'practical car' buyers. I know it did me.
18,2018-06-29T14:33:33+00:00,fintail,"I find the Camry decent from the sides (tall greenhouse for a modern car), but in my eyes the front and rear migrates between ""ugh"" and ""yikes"".

The Accord is kind of weird and almost kind of French-like, to me, which may alienate the white goods car buyer."
19,2018-06-29T14:35:46+00:00,ab348,I still have only seen one new Accord in the wild here.
20,2018-06-29T14:36:01+00:00,stickguy,"I hardly see any accords, but also seeing fewer new camrys than I expected. Both are hard to miss, accord more so."
21,2018-06-29T22:51:56+00:00,berri,Maybe kind of easy to mix the new Accord with the new Civic?
22,2018-06-29T22:57:19+00:00,tjc78,Someone at work just got one burgundy over black. Looks like an SE or whatever the sport trim is. Front end is horrific but rest I actually like.

1. Gray BMW X2
2. Black Acura RDX
3. Yellow Lamborghini Urus (!!!!)"
24,2018-07-01T14:28:41+00:00,kyfdx,Urus? Only in Florida... lol
25,2018-07-01T15:31:18+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,What? You don't think you need 640 HP to haul those 100 lb sacks of arugula salad mix?
26,2018-07-01T16:16:13+00:00,fintail,"I have yet to see a Uterus around here, but it is coming - I see Bentayga around more often than I imagined, and this will attract the same Marie Antoinette demographic (before the Cullinan poaches the truly rich from the plain old rich)."
27,2018-07-01T17:39:47+00:00,JustinS,I think the Urus was a test vehicle for a dealer because I don’t think they’re available quite yet. I also see more Bentaygas than I would have guessed. Maybe 1 every 1-2 weeks here in Tampa. 
28,2018-07-01T23:34:45+00:00,fintail,"That makes sense, I didn't think they were on sale yet either. I saw one at the auto show in Vancouver at the end of March.

Speaking of new 4x4s, tons of new style Jeeps on the roads around Seattle. Outdoorsman cosplay is a thing for tech workers here, so there's a market."
29,2018-07-03T01:33:59+00:00,fintail,"On the road today: new style Aston Martin, higher trim Stinger."
30,2018-07-03T05:27:20+00:00,andres3,I saw a Stinger GT as well today. My first in the wild.
31,2018-07-03T19:14:48+00:00,tjc78,I've only seen one so far...
32,2018-07-05T13:21:37+00:00,fintail,"Was out for a little drive yesterday, stopped at the MB dealer, which is next to the Porsche dealer. They had a couple Panamera Turismo models - one was in the showroom (I didn't check it out), the other outside, no sticker. However, sitting out on the lot, they had a Panamera hybrid turbo with a 210K MSRP - that's a spicy meatball. Other highlight was a Targa with nearly a C-class in options, 162K. MB dealer was little changed from my visit a couple weeks ago when the car was serviced, I think it is funny that a moderately equipped AMG GT roadster at ~135K seems like a value proposition these days.

Used car section of the Porsche dealer was also amusing - many Porsches and higher end cars, but one outlier, a rental spec late model Corolla, replete with hubcaps."
33,2018-07-05T13:44:54+00:00,sda,"For the longest time I didn't see many new Accords on the road. They are common sight now. I've only seen two Stingers so far, didn't get a close look to determine what model. Also seen a couple of Alfa Romeos, the Gullia (sp?) looks a lot better in person than in the pictures I've seen. They look lean and sporty."
34,2018-07-05T23:31:11+00:00,andres3,"That Corolla must be the ""out"" when a salesman guarantees a young guy their credit isn't so bad they can't drive home in a new car (for them) today!"
35,2018-07-06T01:09:10+00:00,fintail,"I was thinking it was a ""car for every budget"" claim, I can't imagine why it would be there. Your credit won't matter if you don't have the cash flow for that 100K note"
36,2018-07-09T16:53:57+00:00,jpp75,Saw my first new Stinger GT in the wild this morning. Red with temporary tags on it.
37,2018-07-09T21:02:39+00:00,Michaell,Speaking of Stingers...
38,2018-07-10T01:26:46+00:00,fintail,"Saw an Ecosport today, and a new style Jetta that seemed to be like a light mint green."
39,2018-07-10T01:42:08+00:00,stickguy,"I saw a Jetta in that green color in the showroom. I really liked it. My daughter, she did not.

she plans to get a platinum gray. Sharp looking in that color."
40,2018-07-10T01:50:28+00:00,iluvmysephia1,"Do you like the new Jetta body style, you guys, or is it really pretty much the same?"
41,2018-07-10T02:02:10+00:00,stickguy,"I really like it. IMO, looks much better than the old style. More interest to it, and looks more expensive. And I think it is overall attractive."
42,2018-07-10T02:04:27+00:00,texases,"Can't say I'm a big fan. Looks OK, but front (grill in particular) looks kind of heavy."
43,2018-07-10T02:06:36+00:00,benjaminh,"Not a fan of the new Jetta in style. Plus I think it has torsion bar rear suspension. I guess Hyundai does that too for the Elantra, unless you get the Sport. In terms of bang for the buck I guess it's ok."
44,2018-07-10T02:09:06+00:00,stickguy,"they did go back to the simpler suspension, but from the tests I read, it does the job fine. I had no complaints about the ride the 2 times I rode in one. More comfy than our 2015. Have not driven one though myself yet.

Correct about the Elantra. I have the multi link set-up."
45,2018-07-10T02:21:51+00:00,fintail,"I think design-wise, it looks more connected to Euro market VWs, the grille and greenhouse."
46,2018-07-10T08:30:37+00:00,andres3,"Saw a nice, but probably 7 or 8 year old MB with the plates ""NBAPLYR"" on it. Hmmm....."
47,2018-07-10T10:45:17+00:00,tjc78,"A small car does just fine on the older suspension.  The Elantra rides like a much bigger car. One cost cutting thing I have to knock them for is the drum brakes in the back.  Our base model 08 had four wheel discs and the much better equipped 17 has drums.

To be perfectly fair the brakes are great and I haven’t warped the rotors yet so there’s that.  The 17 Enclave just started a little pulsation at high speed braking. The 15 Enclave I had the rotors cut under warranty sometime during the lease too (I think around 18k miles).  "
48,2018-07-10T13:01:15+00:00,qbrozen,I picture a Chrysler or Cadillac badge on that grille. Can't quite pin it down.
49,2018-07-10T13:02:39+00:00,stickguy,"It looks nice in person. And unlike some new cars, no overwrought tortured styling!"

17,2018-07-27T23:02:46+00:00,andres3,"I saw an attractive brunette in a recent model Porsche 911 Turbo. A slow moving old boxy something or other (like an old Forester maybe) managed to get in front when the street got down to 1-lane, and goes up a hill. The boxy SUV starts going really slow. Predictably, the Turbo Porsche starts to get really close, then tailgates, then honks their horn. This was somewhat justified, as predictably, the guy in the box slow car wanted to escalate the situation all along with their passive-aggressive driving, and slowed down even more (drastically slowing). I""m behind the 911 so now I'm a victim of the slow down caused by Mr. Passive-Aggressive. So I honk too.

At the top of the hill, the road widens a bit, but is still one lane. The Porsche aggressively moves to pass them on the right, and successfully does so. I continue to honk at the car that got passed, but I'm turning right at the next intersection anyway, and they went on their way, straight, going much faster than when the 911 was behind them."
18,2018-07-28T13:05:42+00:00,kyfdx,So... what did all that horn honking accomplish?
19,2018-07-28T16:20:20+00:00,fintail,"Pressure release valve, easier than yelling

I honked this morning, at a dimwit in their XC60 who bumbled down a straight only lane at half the limit, caused everyone to miss the light, then jerked over into the turn lane at last second."
20,2018-07-28T17:40:04+00:00,kyfdx,"I've found that most drivers seem even angrier, after honking... I don't think the valve really releases any pressure."
21,2018-07-28T23:31:36+00:00,berri,We just seem to have become an overstressed country anymore. Rudeness way too often seems to prevail these days. Kinda sad really.
22,2018-07-29T00:11:08+00:00,fintail,"Maybe some become more irritated when I honk, to me, it is easier than yelling or doing a pit maneuver. I know in some parts of the country (crapholes, to paraphrase our dear leader, perhaps), a honk might be met with gunfire, but much less likely here. Honking in the fintail is also fun, as the horn is 5x louder than a modern car.

Rudeness could be a chicken and egg, what is ruder - honking, or driving like a decapitated chicken who earns the honk? Oh, if only we had the inconsiderate driver thread

On the new car topic, someone in my building has a new (or at least new to them) 4er GC, debadged, pearl white."

24,2018-07-29T03:28:32+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Yep, fintail horns are loud--borderline obnoxious by today's standards--a sharp dual horn with a spinal cord frequency."
25,2018-07-29T03:30:27+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Or a Mercedes 600 horn would be a nice addition:
26,2018-07-29T03:40:21+00:00,fintail,"That's the one, I believe the same on all fintails, but somehow mine seems louder. People look when you honk, that's for sure. I've thought of a 600 retrofit, but I bet those are pricey. That video reminds me I want to get my steering wheel refinished.

This ponton horn sounds familiar, too:



Maybe the next time I drive it, I will make a horn video.

On that note, I gave a short toot when out again just an hour ago, to a Rogue that stopped for an invisible stop sign (and once again, I missed a light).

For new cars, there's a Model 3 at the building where I store the fintail. Base wheels, dirty, has plates but still has the temp registration in the window, sounds about like what I expect."
27,2018-07-29T04:08:23+00:00,andres3,"The honking of the horn for me was equivalent to yelling:

1) Your inept driving was noticed, and your control-freak desires are not tolerated on the roadway, and by the way, the 1,000,000 cars behind you don't find it acceptable, and you are not the only 2 people on the planet!

2) Move it! I got places to be!"

The M-B horns are loud but have a higher-note ""Euro"" sound to them that I associate with European city traffic. The GM ones sounded like this (sadly installed on an old CRV):"

Doesn't happen with our crossover. My attitude is: you hit it, you bought it because in reality their insurance will probably payout more than a dealer will on trade. I'm not going to be your point man getting the ticket for 15 or more over the limit. I say that because oftentimes when they pass, they end up hitting their brakes and driving about the same speed as I was already doing. Too much!"
31,2018-07-29T17:44:13+00:00,fintail,"Ponton coupes and cabrios are relatively rare and expensive, along with wincingly expensive to restore.

That GM horn sounds like a train, nice. Horns on many modern cars are almost embarrassing, like they are yelling and apologizing at the same time. To relate to new cars, maybe there could be a market retrofitting new cars with real horns.

For those triggered by horns, I suspect they or maybe someone they are yoked to get honked at a bit. For people who notice lots of honking, maybe look to personal driving habits"
32,2018-07-30T17:07:48+00:00,andres3,"I've heard that from others, similar to your story. I don't get it. When I pass, I pass, and I continue to pass gaining more and more room each second between your car and mine. I wouldn't pass just to slow down unless my radar detector indicated a reason to do so.

Strange your Camry gets tailgated more often than your Crossover. Are you sure you are driving them the same? The meager 4-banger in the Camry is pretty slow. Perhaps your acceleration rate is offending them (it's not always about top cruising speed)."

Actually quite sharp looking. but surprisingly large. Looks almost as long as her hubbys recently purchased Silverado. also black. I made a crack about cornering the market on black chebbies.

He traded in a Cruze on the PU, so I guess that beast made the large SUV redundant."

It was a birthday present, I was curious how it compared to my first car, a '65 with the 170. As expected, it was much bigger (what a long front!) and MUCH faster. What I wasn't expecting was how LOUD it was, at all times. Starting, driving in traffic, hitting the gas, LOUD! It kept me from using the gas as much as I might have. I guess I'm not the target market..."
17,2018-08-17T14:32:12+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Isn't there some sort of exhaust adjustment? Many cars have that these days.

I also wondered if some of the noise might have been artificially piped in through the stereo, but the open windows showed the car was making plenty of noise the old-fashioned way.

And to think that many GT buyers think the stock exhaust is too tame. I seem to remember Edmunds did a long term test of one a few years back, and considered an aftermarket exhaust."
19,2018-08-17T14:48:13+00:00,stickguy,"Probably most shocking, I bet the GT got way better mileage. Especially highway.

Most noteworthy was 2 late run 18 G63s, both in odd colors. It seems the G color palette has expanded lately, and some old colors have returned. The one in the showroom was ""Tectite Grey"", the same color as my old E55, and one that previously existed from around 1995-2003 or so. Nice color, cool car, I had to sit in it - but dreary black interior, and 160K MSRP. The other G was ""Mauritius Blue"", another color with some age, but is a bit bright for me. Same dark interior and MSRP. Other cars on the lot were as-expected, maybe the S63 cabrio being a little unusual. Used section had a few loaner or ex-rental E class and tons of W205 C-class but no E-class with many options. Looking at these and then getting back in my car has me satisfied with my car. Neighboring Porsche dealer had a usual lineup, oddity was a Panamera wagon (as I call it), but no MSRP, and a MB E43 sedan in the used section, 57K asking, no drivers assist option."

It coordinates with any exterior color, it is probably seen as somewhat fashionable (Germans have been into it for years), and although it shows small dust and hairs etc, it doesn't show built up grime nearly as bad as a light color. Especially if leather or pleather, it is easy to clean.

What happened to blue interiors? I like blue. Blue interiors are effectively gone for mass market cars, and have been gone for some time."

30,2018-08-19T02:03:54+00:00,ab348,"Far too much black used these days.

The shrinkage in color options in interiors is unfortunate. Maybe until around 2000 you could still get some choices like blue, red, maybe even green in addition to tan, gray and black. Not all of those in every model of course, but you had some choice.

One of the underrated interior shades that is seemingly going away is the very light dove gray that used to be popular. I had that in my Lacrosse and really liked it. Going back into the '70s Ford used to offer a knit nylon cloth in the LTD and other top-line models in that shade and it looked wonderful.

@explorerx4 sent me a copy of the book Car! that detailed the development of the '96 Taurus (a very engaging read) and the author spent some time discussing the process around the seat fabric choice, which was apparently one of the first applications of Uglycloth (TM Regd.) via a multicolor printed fabric which was not well-received by dealers and the public. It seemed in that account that the interior color was barely given any thought at all given the much bigger challenges the development team faced."
31,2018-08-19T02:29:21+00:00,fintail,"MB had blue into the mid 90s, maybe late 90s on carryover models. Some, I think Honda especially, have limited it to just greybeige and black on some models.

My Bluetec has brown, which I like even if much of the trim is black. At least it gives some contrast, and at the same time coordinates well with the natural finish wood:



My prior E had light grey, which brightened things up inside and had kind of a posh feeling, but showed dirt easily. Luckily it was tex, and was easy to clean:



I have a 2018 G Wagen brochure, and it lists 21 interior color choices (some are distinctions between solid color and color/black), including a dark blue. The real fun thing is exterior colors - 13 regular colors, 26 designo colors. At that price point, I guess there should be variety.

I remember the 96 Taurus cloth choices, here's a good illustration:



Looks like fungal growth."
32,2018-08-19T10:53:49+00:00,ab348,"Ha, your present E interior is almost exactly the same shades as used in my ATS, and your former E had the same grey that my Lacrosse sported!

Man, that IS bad. I had no recollection of that. What were they thinking?

Mid-90s to mid-2000s seemed to have an epidemic of Uglycloth (TM Regd.) upholstery, at least in N.A. makes. I remember seeing similarly unappealing fabrics in Chevys, the Pontiac Grand Prix, and some Chrysler products. Hopefully a trend that does not return."
33,2018-08-19T16:48:32+00:00,fintail,"I think brown has made a minor comeback, and I am all for it - something to break the monotony, and it is a rich looking color. Grey can work too in the right shade with the right trim. My ideal MB color combo would be diamond silver on porcelain (or blue, if it exists for the model), but I don't see many like that.

The uglycloth I think is following a 90s trend in Europe, but made boring for NA consumption. Starting in the 90s, many more affordable Euro cars had kind of playful or brash cloth patterns, and it was probably seen as a way to liven up a basic product:







The era around the turn of the century sometimes seems like a mini-malaise era, things got pretty dull for awhile, and some cars had reliability issues.

Maybe you should try to find another similar car. Nice ones are out there. It'd be easy to learn, maybe more relaxing to drive, and the best-of-the-best 126s are becoming sought after, and have definitely stopped depreciating."
26,2018-10-20T22:45:45+00:00,bhill2,"You know, Fin, I have considered that maybe for our second/pleasure car. We loved that old tank, it had become a trusted family member. If I were to go looking, my impression is that I would be better served by a 420 than a 560 because of less complication. Also, I assume that the later ones (say '89 - '91) would be preferable. Am I on the right track?"
27,2018-10-20T23:37:23+00:00,fintail,"I'd support that decision, but you probably already know that.

I don't know if maintenance would be a big deal between a 420 and 560, if a limited use car. These days, I would choose the nicest car possible rather than limiting it by engine. The I6 300SE/SEL is even easier to maintain, but the trimmings are only maybe 90% as fancy (different wood, a couple less gadgets) than a 560, but they will be slower. The 89+ cars are probably the most refined, as that year there was a mild facelift with revised steering wheel and upholstery, and passenger airbags became more common. Budget maybe 15K for a fairly pristine car, or 10K or so for one that gets driven more. These prices are for cars with few to no needs. They can be found much cheaper, but I think you personally really want a minter."

That's all rumor and speculation."

39,2018-10-23T02:50:34+00:00,boomchek,"Some of the Mirages come with front power windows and rear roll ups. Kind of like the Neons or SX 2.0's from years ago. I guess they have to cut costs somewhere. The 3 cylinder engine under the hood looks like a lawnmower engine. I think they started at $9,995 CDN when they were relaunched a few years ago."
40,2018-10-23T04:37:41+00:00,boomchek,"The ZDX kind of grew on me. I think it looks better than the X6 for a ""SUV coupe"".

Speaking of SUVs, I saw the new Discovery on the road for the first time few weeks ago and it looks very oddly proportioned from the rear. Narrow and tall. Land Rover has a really nice looking lineup imo but the Disco just looks odd. It probably didn't help that suspension was set to off road as it was riding super high and gave it an even more awkward appearance."
41,2018-10-23T14:45:42+00:00,texases,Reminds me of the too-narrow first-gen SRX:
42,2018-10-24T05:39:12+00:00,boomchek,Funny thing I rarely see any first gen SRXs on the road anymore. There used to be quite a few of them out there but from experience in the auto business they weren't the most reliable Caddys.

46,2018-10-25T09:46:50+00:00,tjc78,My Mom had the Toyota equivalent of those for awhile.   It actually was a fairly versatile vehicle with tons of room inside.  IMO the Venza was the best looking iteration of the tall station wagons. 
47,2018-10-25T11:25:45+00:00,fushigi,"One neighbor has - and likes - a Crosstour so I see one daily. He's not really a car guy and is, I think, content with having a little more utility than an Accord without having to go all the way to an SUV or minivan (which his wife drives).

Most of my immediate neighbors are in the minivan + 'other' camp where other might be another minivan, a sedan, or a SUV. As the kids are growing & some are off to college it'll be interesting to see if the car choices change. One did exchange their minivan for a Traverse; I expect that sort of exchange to continue."
48,2018-10-25T12:01:57+00:00,kyfdx,I think the Venza has better packaging for passengers and cargo. Not so sloped.
49,2018-10-25T12:34:18+00:00,tjc78,"My wife has told me she wants an SUV for the foreseeable future.  

I will most likely keep a car for my driving.   We work in the same office so minimum 3/5 days we ride in together and take her car.  

My kids are still small and in car seats (my son is pretty much ready for a booster but still fits) so the three row SUV is nice to have.  "

My car, could be anything, like still a sedan."
1,2018-10-25T13:43:05+00:00,texases,"Yeah, the Venza is more equivalent to the Ford Edge. Full on CUV."
2,2018-10-25T17:49:15+00:00,fushigi,"My wife is torn. She's come around to CUVs as I've had one since '09. The ride height, easier entry/exit, AWD for winter, and cargo capacity (and easy loading) are appealing. Neither of us drives a lot of miles; she just rolled 39K after 7 years, so outstanding fuel economy is not a primary feature we need.

She also prefers small cars and to her, her '12 Elantra is almost too big for her to comfortably drive. She's only driven my QX60 a couple of times on the highway. Something the size of the Tucson might work but she'd prob go more for the Kona. Having had good experiences with Hyundai she's likely to stay with them."
3,2018-10-25T19:24:34+00:00,stickguy,"I was going to say, if she likes the Elantra, Kona could be perfect."
4,2018-10-25T20:22:11+00:00,explorerx4,"In the parking lot at work...
White Corolla, Burgundy Odyssey, Black Tacoma. Pretty Average stuff."
5,2018-10-26T13:46:09+00:00,fushigi,"Just have to add 2 more Crosstours yesterday .. one black, one white and my neighbor's is silver so not the same one multiple times.

Stickguy, yes on the Kona but Ioniq is also a possibility if she decides to stay on the sedan side of things. She's never been a big fan of hatchbacks but the crappy trunk openings of most cars nowadays is, I think, influencing her. Sure, the groceries and whatnot physically fit in the trunk but the openings and necessary bending over (she bends over a lot for her job & often has a sore back) are detractors."
6,2018-10-28T16:28:28+00:00,explorerx4,"I about 20 minutes, spotted 4 Tesla's. 3S's and a gray 3 with really ugly wheels."
7,2018-10-28T16:35:06+00:00,fintail,"The base wheels on a 3 are awkward, resembling hubcaps. They scream ""cheap [non-permissible content removed]"" in a way, good strategy to sell the higher model. Basic S and X wheels are also easy to see, they look small."
8,2018-10-29T21:16:28+00:00,explorerx4,"Saw it yesterday and wasn't sure what it was. Saw it again today, a white Honda Clarity."
9,2018-10-30T19:12:21+00:00,tifighter,"The base wheels include the aero covers, which apparently add approx 5% more range to the car:

If you don't like them, they can be taken off and reveal the stock wheels underneath:

I like that they give you the option."
10,2018-10-30T19:34:51+00:00,explorerx4,"@tifighter,
Yes those are the wheels I saw."
11,2018-10-30T20:05:24+00:00,andres3,Do they overheat your brakes 5% faster too?
12,2018-10-30T20:33:56+00:00,fintail,"Kind of like the Prius, has actual wheels under the dorky covers. 5% seems like a strong claim, but given that all the guts are in the lower half, maybe.

Saw an RS3, not common."
13,2018-10-30T20:43:39+00:00,laurasdada,"Two Tesla 3s appeared at the same time at work, red and blue. The four charging stations at work are now regularly booked, including a BMW X5 plugin."

15,2018-10-30T20:56:25+00:00,laurasdada,"Texas, I thought about that. I've read of the electric hierarchy, the disdain full BEV folks have for plugins, who overstay their welcome at the charging stations!"
16,2018-10-30T23:49:37+00:00,tjc78,That would be a friendly email “Any chance I could have the charger around lunch time?”
17,2018-10-31T00:59:27+00:00,tifighter,"We have a small office of nine, with four of those driving EVs. There is one charger. It hasn't been an issue at our size; everyone has figured out their time slot. More people would create more obvious complications. We'd just add more chargers, but as the batteries get bigger, I could foresee a time when we wouldn't need to. I'm actually out of the schedule now, but some of the guys are coming from the burbs with 1st gen Leafs. They need to charge."
18,2018-10-31T01:19:04+00:00,fintail,"I work in an office campus of 5 buildings, and my building might have close to 1000 people. As far as I know, there are 2 EV spots. If you get there by 6, you might get one, otherwise, good luck. There was a Model S that would monopolize it for eons, haven't seen it around lately, maybe someone read them the riot act. I've seen at least 3 Model 3s in the garage as well."
19,2018-10-31T10:20:59+00:00,tjc78,"We have about 250 parked cars between office and warehouse team members at any given time.  

The only Tesla owner has moved on and we have no charging station.  I don’t think we ever will.   Kinda surprising they didn’t install one when they did the solar panels on the roof.  It was a pretty big deal being the largest array in the state at the time (maybe still, not sure).  The charging station would have been a nice little value add to the whole thing.   "
20,2018-10-31T17:01:11+00:00,laurasdada,"Yeah, four building office park here, ~1200 folks. Four stations, but not always in use. Two Tesla 3s, a few Prii, couple of Ford C-Max and the BMW X5e, by my count are the consumers. So, hopefully there will be an open spot for the i8 I don't own. Yet? Probably not. Probably. Nah, doesn't make sense. 3 more years of tuition..."
21,2018-11-01T22:16:35+00:00,explorerx4,"In the parking lot at work...
2 new Jetta's, a black one and a white one.
Also a new Lexus, IS350? Looked a bit muscular.
After that, a couple of blocks up the street, a new black XC40."
22,2018-11-04T21:44:48+00:00,explorerx4,"A white Volvo V60 wagon.
Also saw a couple of Jaguar XF wagons, was poking around a car dealer lot.
Had no idea they make a wagon. The sticker on the one we looked at was 78k."
23,2018-11-04T21:47:21+00:00,stickguy,I assume the outgoing (2018) V60? Unless the brand new design hit the ground already which would surprise me.
24,2018-11-04T21:57:24+00:00,explorerx4,"I'm thinking it was new design although other than being a Volvo, I had no idea what it was until I got close behind it. Of course, I'm not sure the last time I saw a newer V60."
25,2018-11-12T21:47:51+00:00,fintail,"Saw the new baby Caddy CUV on the road in suburban Detroit today.

I've really noticed the higher proportion of later model domestic cars on the road here compared to the west coast, especially outside the cities. I noticed more brand diversity in Cleveland, and even around Detroit, but some other places it seemed to be 95% domestic."
26,2018-11-13T00:33:53+00:00,berri,Did you hit the Rock 'n Roll Hall of fame while in Cleveland? The east side has some good Italian food and the west side good ribs.
27,2018-11-13T01:50:15+00:00,fintail,"Nope, didn't really have time, and the Christmas Story house was more relevant to me. Maybe if I return another time."
28,2018-11-16T22:21:42+00:00,fintail,"In Detroit, I saw some kind of cladded mule/protoype of a middle CUV kind of vehicle, maybe a Ford as I was in Dearborn. On the highway today I saw a cladded 4 door Jeep Wrangler pickup mule."
29,2018-11-17T00:03:05+00:00,Michaell,"The Jeep is the new Gladiator.

I've seen some disguised cars here in Colorado, for high altitude testing."
30,2018-11-19T20:10:22+00:00,qbrozen,"Saw my first Buick Sportbrake thingy in the wild yesterday right here in my home town. Nothing terribly special, but good looking, and it stood out enough that I spotted it coming at me from far away."
31,2018-11-19T20:52:53+00:00,stickguy,Big wagons used to be everywhere. Now they really stand out. Sad.
32,2018-11-28T22:31:54+00:00,stickguy,"a new style Altima with temp tags. Nice looking. sharper than the old one, but looks lower, and quite a bit (especially in profile) like an Accord. Interior was nice."
33,2018-11-28T23:33:46+00:00,Michaell,"Now also,available with AWD and a turbo instead of the V6"
34,2018-11-29T18:17:54+00:00,tjc78,"Saw a brand new Sienna ""SE"".. all black, clear taillights and black wheels. I never really got the idea of a sporty Minivan.

Not the first time it's been done.... head over to Mystery Car Pix"
35,2018-11-30T05:27:21+00:00,boomchek,"Dodge has a sporty trim level for their Caravan too with blacked out light housings and black wheels, black grille and trim. I guess when the same design has been out for a decade they need new ideas for trim levels to help sell it."
36,2018-12-02T00:55:17+00:00,stickguy,"out car shopping today, saw a Stinger in an odd flat battleship gray. Not at all attractive. Not sure why, but it was parked at the Honda dealer.

also a Lincoln Nautilus. Dumb name, but pretty sharp looking car. Replacement for the MKX (iow the Lincoln Edge)"
37,2018-12-02T01:15:32+00:00,tjc78,"Explorer based, right?"
38,2018-12-02T01:25:00+00:00,stickguy,"could be. Did not look that big, but could be just the styling."
39,2018-12-02T01:42:33+00:00,texases,The Aviator is the 3-row Explorer derivative. 
40,2018-12-02T01:53:46+00:00,tjc78,"Yeah, but old truck based Explorer both disc

The Nautilus is still the Edge based model like the MKX was. I just looked it up."
41,2018-12-02T02:47:47+00:00,stickguy,that is what it looked like to me. I mentioned the edge to the salesguy and he didn't correct it!
42,2018-12-02T03:13:53+00:00,texases,"Nope, new Aviator is based on new Explorer."
43,2018-12-02T11:05:55+00:00,tjc78,"Ok.... now I feel better.  I knew there was supposed to be an Explorer based new Lincoln SUV.  I just didn’t realize the MKX was being renamed to Nautilus.  All makes sense now. 

Thanks! "
44,2018-12-02T11:41:10+00:00,explorerx4,"I believe the Aviator is supposed is going to get released fist, so technically Explorer is a derivative of the Aviator."
45,2018-12-02T21:52:18+00:00,berri,"From what I've read, the next gen Explorer/Aviator will be unibody rear wheel drive or optional AWD, but still RWD favored when AWD not needed. Should be interesting."
46,2018-12-02T23:26:34+00:00,texases,Interesting. Does it have any relationship to the Mustang chassis?  I thought they were going to use that for some new vehicle. 
47,2018-12-02T23:56:23+00:00,berri,I don't know. They'd have to extend that quite a bit for a large 3 seat SUV. But I think Ford is planning on some other crossovers in the next couple of years as well. I also think Ford (and Honda) is beginning to use some sort of AWD system that shifts power between all four wheels in some popular priced vehicles. It would be nice to see Ford step into the limelight for awhile after years of nothing much special.
48,2018-12-16T19:29:58+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new style Altima on the road, apparent rental. Looks like an improvement, although the faux floating C-pillar can't go away soon enough."
49,2018-12-17T19:46:08+00:00,fintail,Saw a new Avalon this morning. A stunning combination of bland and ghastly.
0,2018-12-18T17:30:14+00:00,tlong,"The other day I saw a mint Mercury Grand Marquis. Driven by an old lady. From the appearance and license plate number, I'd guess it was late 80s-early 90's vintage. I'll be it had at least 20K miles on it..."
1,2018-12-19T21:27:05+00:00,fintail,"Don't know where to put this, but as the Lambo Uterus is now a real thing, this is worth a laugh:"
2,2018-12-19T21:29:44+00:00,berri,They lowered the roofline for a new streamlined design
3,2018-12-19T21:33:18+00:00,texases,"There was a recent article (on Jalopnik?) about how Pontiac was just ahead of their time, given the current CUV craze."
4,2018-12-19T21:45:16+00:00,kyfdx,I'm in total agreement with that.
5,2018-12-19T22:43:22+00:00,stickguy,same as AMC. The Eagle would have saved the company if it came out 20-30 years later. Look what the outback did for subaru.
6,2018-12-20T03:23:08+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Spotted a Lexus LC500. Very impressive car from all angles....except the front. It was parked so I gave it a good lookover for a few minutes, from all angles. Loved the sculpted body panels and tried to adjust to the front grille but I couldn't get myself to accept it as ""part of the whole""."
7,2018-12-20T06:53:50+00:00,boomchek,"Oh cmon, the Urus is a good design. Probably the best looking out of most of the luxury SUVs. The Bentayga and Levante for example are not elegant designs at all.

Betayga proportions look weird and the Levante could pass off as a generic $30k modern SUV."
8,2018-12-20T14:22:18+00:00,fintail,"I am not sure how one sees out of the Urus, but I also strongly doubt the target demographic cares, or usually looks before reversing or turning to begin with. All of these super-priced new age SUVs are dull in their own way, or maybe I am just jaded against who will end up behind the wheel of them in my neighborhood.

Saw a NSX last night, the RLX of supercars."
9,2018-12-20T17:50:40+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"AMC didn't survive long enough to develop the Eagle (which needed a LOT of development). Even the early Subarus were pretty rough pieces of work, but by the 1990s they were functionally a lot better. Then Subaru could finally afford a Styling Department in the early 2000s."
10,2018-12-20T21:06:07+00:00,texases,"Given the links to the Cayenne, I'd sure want to compare the two before springing for the extra $$$ Urus."
11,2018-12-23T00:36:03+00:00,fintail,"Stopped by the MB dealer while out and about in the fintail. A couple of interesting things - first, a new S coupe with a white interior and steering wheel. Still a striking design at 5 years old:



And a new style CLS 53 in a matte finish that I thought was a fad that passed. MSRP barely shy of 100K:



Funny thing, I was out looking at the used cars, and a salesman came up to me and chatted, while he was looking for a car in inventory. He remembered what I drove, but I don't recall dealing with him before. Maybe they are waiting for me, yeah, that's right. He also said they can negotiate on lease residuals."
12,2018-12-23T01:04:29+00:00,qbrozen,I'd run away from a salesman who claimed that. Or I'd challenge him to do so. Would depend on how much time I felt like wasting.
13,2018-12-23T01:19:11+00:00,fintail,"He named the car, he had the info in his head somehow, and I didn't drive there in that car, rather, in the fintail.

Another fun thing there, the receptionist who always seems to be there always remembers my name."
14,2018-12-23T03:17:23+00:00,laurasdada,"A used S Coupe is on my radar. But, it is so large..."
15,2018-12-23T06:33:43+00:00,bhill2,"Hmmm, I want that CLS drivetrain in an E-Class sedan. So I’m looking at maybe $85K similarly equipped?"
16,2018-12-23T19:00:24+00:00,fintail,"I suspect that's about right. It'll base over 70 I think, and you know how options are on these (even my Bluetec has 14K in options, and it isn't a full load). That engine interests me a lot too, maybe it would be fun to have a new I6 to go with my old one.

I have noticed early run S coupes are depreciating almost down to my level. But at that price I start looking at G-wagens too, and that's something maybe better left alone."
17,2018-12-23T19:54:14+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Aside from the new G-wagons, which are considerably improved, I have to say, having examined an older one closely, that they are about the most ineptly designed vehicle built in the last 25 years--right up there with the Hummer and the Chevy SSR. I would have expected something more than exposed door hinges and glued-on lights for that kind of money. M-B must still be laughing."
18,2018-12-23T23:00:04+00:00,fintail,"G-wagen (until 2018) is a 1979 design, it was old 25 years ago

It's a utility vehicle with a luxury pretense, rather than the other way around."
19,2018-12-23T23:04:05+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well I'll give it credit for very little pretense then. At least it's for real in the dirt, but my god, what a mess it is for the $$$.

Fortunately M-B really cleaned it up for 2019. Not sure it's still worth the money but at least now you can present yourself as the owner without too much embarrassment at having paid the full MSRP."
20,2018-12-23T23:50:48+00:00,fintail,"The fun thing about the G (especially for MB, as the margins have to be yuuuuge) is that value is exactly 0% of the reason to buy one. The target market doesn't care about it, so MB doesn't have to offer it. I've heard you can't find the new model on lots - all sold. Maybe some discounts to be had on old ones. MBs of all model will generally carry at least a 10% discount from MSRP just by some moderate negotiating.

They don't depreciate insanely fast, either."
21,2018-12-24T22:00:57+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Wellll......I dunno about that. I would grant that the power of advertising and image are considerable in keeping the buyer somewhat deluded, but people with that kind of money aren't stupid. I think they know perfectly well that the G has been a primitive, gutless, clumsy, spartan ""image"". Perhaps it's the exclusivity and the ""look""."
22,2018-12-25T01:03:41+00:00,fintail,"This is the new Belle Epoque. Plenty of people with that kind of money didn't really do jack for it, and many rich people are stupid, monied via the lucky birth club and the breaks and connections that come with it. Many of the target demographic fall into that category. These things are barely advertised at all - they are a known entity without it.

As it has only officially been offered with a V8 and for some time the base model has been well over 400 hp, I don't know about the gutless - clumsy and spartan are part of that image. It doesn't need to be a roadholder when it will only cruise from a gated mcmansion orchard to a gallery mall or club. It's definitely the look, but I don't think they are exclusive - if you want one, your local dealer will gladly order you one today."
23,2018-12-25T01:18:33+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"The older ones were pretty gutless, with 2.4L diesels, or sometimes 2.8L gas. It got better engines in 1990."
24,2018-12-25T01:23:16+00:00,fintail,"We never received those through official channels, they were meant for utilitarian work. The first official US model G-Wagen was not until MY 2002, the rest are private imports or Europa cars. Those small engine cars also usually had no power accessories, likely no AC, cloth or vinyl interior, etc. It was not originally designed as a luxury vehicle - that's part of the appeal for some."
25,2018-12-25T01:27:54+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"They were incredibly backward all the way up to 2018--for that kind of $$$, you could buy so much more. Benz seemed almost cynical about it, as in ""you really want one of these things Americans? OK, here...we'll glue some extra stuff on it, and reverse-engineer some clunky updates...now go away""."
26,2018-12-25T01:33:11+00:00,fintail,"Like was mentioned, people who buy these aren't seeking value, aren't being rational. It's a show off splurge. 90% image is what sells it, and will continue to sell it."
27,2018-12-25T20:50:17+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"I was reading about this prank where a TV production company bought up some cheap shoes from Payless and reboxed them with a phony ""upscale brand name"" and sold them to people at outrageous prices---the buyers were totally convinced that the shoes were in fact some kind of hand-made imported artisan shoe.

So yeah, they were buying the box the shoes came in. They had no discernment as to the quality of the object of their desire."
28,2018-12-26T23:30:59+00:00,fintail,"Not sure if those shoes are apples to apples with a G-Wagen. The G is not a cheap product pretending to be expensive. It would be pricey even without bling and leather. It is a high quality old fashioned utility vehicle decked out with fancy bits and a price pumped up to a huge margin.

I suspect it would be easier/less painful to run a G to 150K miles than say a Range Rover of the same price point."
29,2018-12-27T00:10:00+00:00,berri,I actually saw one on the road today. Meh
30,2018-12-27T03:01:29+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,The new ones are cleaned up a bit but there are sure a lot better ways to spend your money than on a new car that already looks like an old one.
31,2018-12-27T03:06:33+00:00,fintail,"I still have yet to see a new style G on the road in person. If my local dealer had any, they sold. This will continue to be a cash cow.

Many aspects of value are subjective. Some want that traditional look, it says ""I have money to throw away, the amount of taxes I dodge/evade are more than your salary"". It is worth it to someone, or MB wouldn't make them"
32,2018-12-27T03:14:32+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Doug DeMuro's review on the 2017 AMG version is pretty amusing. He also reviewed the 2019 and he is a bit kinder:

2017 AMG G-Wagon Review"
33,2018-12-27T03:54:30+00:00,fintail,"A G65 is indeed pretty wacky. It's all about showing off, and the profit margins have to be huge even if volume is low."
34,2018-12-28T14:26:56+00:00,berri,"After going to the store, I just figured out where the MB G Wagon came from: they bred a Jeep and a Brink's truck"
35,2018-12-28T17:53:22+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Or an Isuzu Trooper with a file cabinet?
36,2018-12-28T18:47:08+00:00,berri,"I think the G wagon I saw had one of those side opening doors, so maybe a refrigerator instead of a file cabinet. If it was a conventional or hatch door, then a garage."
37,2018-12-28T20:06:20+00:00,fintail,"G opens from the side, so it is a fridge.

The door handle/latch operation on those is immensely satisfying too, like an old car."
38,2018-12-29T01:13:38+00:00,berri,"You know, as Wally Cleaver on Leave It To Beaver says, ""we're just giving you the business"" and ""immensely satisfying"" has a Madman 50's advertising sound as well"
39,2018-12-29T02:30:11+00:00,fintail,The door action on a G-wagen reminds me of the fintail - a very nice solid click when you close it. Modern cars feel hollow in comparison.
40,2018-12-31T07:30:08+00:00,tlong,"I've often wondered what people from the 1800s, when machinery was heavy iron, would think of all of today's mechanical and even non-mechanical items? I suspect they'd be amazed by things like carbon fiber and even plastic. And aluminum. Everything is immensely lighter than in those days."
41,2018-12-31T17:35:18+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Jules Verne's space rocket was made out of aluminum, in the story Journey to the Moon (1865), and the engine the Wright Brothers used was made out of aluminum (1903). Aluminum electrical wires were being used in the late 1800s."
42,2018-12-31T17:41:59+00:00,kyfdx,"Aluminum electrical wires were being used in the late 1800s.

43,2018-12-31T17:46:45+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Why not? Aluminum gives better conductivity per weight than copper.

Buggest problem with aluminum was electrolysis resulting from splicing it into copper or using the wrong terminations.  

Thinner gauge also also can get brittle over time.  "
48,2018-12-31T18:49:41+00:00,sda,I was 18 when that happened and remember the news stories. Simply horrible and sad.

Fortunately for me, I didn't know anyone that was there, that night.

At the time, I lived about 15 miles from here. But, we moved over here 20 years ago, and I've run into quite a few people that helped out at the makeshift morgue, that night. They were also teenagers, at the time."

3,2019-01-06T02:22:07+00:00,fintail,Saw my first new style G-Wagen on the road.
4,2019-01-06T04:20:58+00:00,Michaell,Were you close to your dealer?
5,2019-01-06T14:22:53+00:00,berri,"The Edge is a decent looker, but I'm not sure I'd pay its price because just a bit more gets you a much more spacious and comfortable crossover instead."
6,2019-01-06T16:28:58+00:00,qbrozen,"But if sportiness AND space is your goal, the Edge Sport is tough to beat at the price. I think you have to go down a size or way up in price to go quicker. (I’m totally guessing and have yet to test this thought)."
7,2019-01-06T17:49:20+00:00,berri,"I look at the Edge size wise as kind of a latest gen CRV usable cargo space, but with more oomph and passenger room. I think I'd consider buying one if they were a couple of grand cheaper. Although 6 footer seating is just a tad tight and the one I sat in at the auto show seemed to have a bit short seat bottom - but there are various trim models including the new Lincoln Nautilus. What I'm really interested in is the forthcoming unibody rwd/awd version of the Explorer. I think it is due out sometime this upcoming summer. Sounds like for a few grand more, it may be a winner. If you are looking for sportiness and speed, it is probably a good reason to go Edge. But I think that top line model puts you into (or darn close to) Nautilus pricing. Depends on priorities I guess."

One side of the box displayed the front of the New Chevy Silverado and the opposite side the back.

43,2019-02-01T14:41:20+00:00,berri,Honda and Toyota just seem often very efficient at space utilization. Kind of ironic that the new CRV appears to be quieter than the new Rav4 since Honda used to trend more sporty and Toyota more GM smooth.

I can't say there was any one vehicle or brand that totally wowed me. Seemed like a very incremental show if you know what I mean. Nothing revolutionary & only a couple of concept cars. But at least Maserati & Alpha Romeo, who historically disallowed or limited butts-in-seats were much more open. Porsche had every single car locked like they were actually special or something.

My best in show vote would probably go to the full-size Chevy Silverado p/u built from 334,000 Legos."

23,2019-03-12T17:24:40+00:00,fintail,120 months from now is the real fun.
24,2019-03-12T17:26:56+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,By that time it's a donation vehicle.
25,2019-03-12T18:04:26+00:00,andres3,@$500/month you'd have that paid off in a spiffy 396 month loan at 0% interest.
26,2019-03-12T18:32:51+00:00,texases,"I volunteer! I'm particularly needy, super-4door-wise..."
27,2019-03-12T18:53:42+00:00,fintail,"See what a 2009 E63 is worth today. The bigger they are, the harder they fall, especially without an exotic body (also a fun case where wagons have significantly better values)."
28,2019-03-12T20:35:33+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Well if you aren't actually needy when I arrange to donate it to you, you certainly will be about 6 months after you own it.

THIS IS THE PRICE FOR ONE SHOCK--and at a discount store!"
29,2019-03-12T20:38:14+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Same car, price for ONE ROTOR"
30,2019-03-12T20:41:40+00:00,ab348,At those prices I'll take a Ferrari instead.
31,2019-03-12T20:42:14+00:00,Michaell,Those prices made my eyes water....
32,2019-03-12T20:43:09+00:00,explorerx4,That rotor is pretty expensive considering all those holes in it.
33,2019-03-12T20:46:52+00:00,fintail,"Per the joke, AMG = All Money Gone"
34,2019-03-12T22:38:27+00:00,qbrozen,"Yet, $52 for the Centric brand. Prime example of why I rarely buy OEM. "
35,2019-03-13T17:17:47+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Are those any good? I have heard pros and cons. I wonder if Wilwood makes rotors for the AMG--they make a very good rotor.
36,2019-03-13T18:35:18+00:00,qbrozen,I bought them for our previous T&C after the stock ones warped and I read that was common. The Centric worked fine and never warped.
37,2019-03-13T18:42:27+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"More often than not, brake rotors do not in fact warp. It's the brake pads causing the wobble. Lots of upsell on rotors.

Next time anyone wants to sell you new rotors, have them show you on a dial gauge.

I guess on some cars, it doesn't matter much if you buy new rotors, but at $1,000 a pop it does!"
38,2019-03-13T21:29:05+00:00,qbrozen,"curious: how do pads cause a wobble?

I don't fully recall, but I believe it is likely I replaced the pads first, vibration remained, so I went back and replaced the rotors. At least, that's the route I would take now, so I can only assume that's what I did then."
39,2019-03-13T21:30:00+00:00,andres3,"Lots of debate on if rotors can be used more than one pad set on ""performance"" vehicles driven the way they were meant to be driven. Apparently OEM rotors sometimes cut out thickness for weight loss at the expense of being able to be used more than one set of pads."
40,2019-03-13T23:59:43+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Here's what Firestone says:

""When you press down on the brake pedal, you kick start a series of rapid events. As you step on the pedal a caliper applies pressure to the brake pad, which in turn clinches down on the rotors. (Similar to how bicycle brakes work.) This brings your car to a stop. If anything is “off” with said brake pad, you may feel it in your steering wheel. Brake pads that are old, worn, or particularly dirty cannot grip the rotor effectively and can cause your steering wheel to quiver."""
41,2019-03-14T13:13:00+00:00,qbrozen,"so, yes, when pressing the brakes. I wouldn't have called it a ""wobble"" though.
I THINK a warped rotor would be more ...hmmm... ""consistent""? rhythmic? Meaning a warped rotor would give you the sensation at the same point(s) in each rotation, while pads would not. Just a total guess.

Also, if warped enough, you could hear/feel it even when not applying the brakes since the rotor could touch the pads on each rotation."
42,2019-03-14T16:00:29+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"The true test would be the dial indicator---no guessing on the shop's part, and no upsell for you if they can't prove it.

Of course, on some German cars....cough, cough....rotors are never turned in case of warpage..you are required to throw them away regardless of the ""meat"" left on them.

I'm half in jest here...I'm sure there are other automakers who require the same thing."
43,2019-03-14T17:19:46+00:00,qbrozen,"What is this ""shop"" you keep speaking of? ;b

Heck, I can swap my rotors, calipers, and pads and still save money over just paying to get pads done at the dealer."
44,2019-03-14T17:22:07+00:00,tjc78,Pad jobs must be a big profit center for the dealer.
45,2019-03-15T18:17:44+00:00,fintail,Someone at work has a new E53 coupe.
46,2019-03-16T01:17:43+00:00,fintail,"On the road this afternoon, saw 2x new RAV4 - one a rental (Toyota has surpassed 00s era GM with fleet dumps, at least around here), and a Bentayga driven in the clueless entitled oblivious manner one would expect from such a vehicle and its bootstrapping driver."
47,2019-03-16T01:23:03+00:00,stickguy,I saw one of those new CUVs recently. Does Maserati make one? I think that is what it was.
48,2019-03-16T01:43:47+00:00,fintail,"Maserati is the ""Levante"". I actually saw one of those, too. White of course, questionably driven, ""baby on board"" sticker, I could make a boatload of assumptions about the driver."
49,2019-03-16T17:27:19+00:00,berri,"I saw a new RAV by the showroom the other day. Seems a bit tinny and chintzy to me, but I haven't driven one. Funny and kind of incongruent, because the RAV in the showroom was loaded up with dealer add-ons while they are already in rental fleets. Maybe Toyota people are a little too loyal to the brand for their own good?"
0,2019-03-16T21:58:57+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,Brand loyalty is a lot like love--sometimes kinda blind.
1,2019-03-16T22:20:21+00:00,explorerx4,"Locally Toyota $1000 recent college graduate incentive on the RAV 4.
Mostly, I see $400/$500.
I just noticed a local Ford dealer has the same offer."
2,2019-03-16T23:30:23+00:00,fintail,"A friend of mine spotted this today, I don't think I have seen one on the road yet:"
3,2019-03-17T00:32:06+00:00,tjc78,"RAV4s.... RAV4s everywhere. Three today all with temp plates.

My mom said she likes the new one.... so I’ll be seeing another one parked in front of my house. Ugh. I thought I had her convinced to get something else once current RAV goes back"
4,2019-03-18T13:38:30+00:00,fintail,"I read there's a CTS replacement coming soon:





That C-pillar, woof, looks like a cross between an Accord and a Regal. Not nice to my eyes."
5,2019-03-18T13:47:12+00:00,stickguy,"it's different. rest of car looks pretty good. at least the nose isn't hideous.

I assume that will replace the ATS also. And probably whatever the one bigger than the C was."
6,2019-03-18T13:47:55+00:00,texases,"Seems like goofy c pillars are contagious. From the second pic you can tell the 'window' in the c pillar is non-functional. Why have it? And the front end is ok, but nothing special."
7,2019-03-18T13:57:21+00:00,fintail,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, stylists/designers are copycat sycophants. This stuff combined with the faux floating pillar movement is like a disease, and someone is loving it and approving it."
8,2019-03-18T14:10:05+00:00,qbrozen,Is that a hatchback??
9,2019-03-18T14:15:47+00:00,fintail,"As far as I know, nope."
10,2019-03-18T14:38:28+00:00,ab348,"The CT5 is the CTS replacement. There is supposed to be a smaller CT4 coming that will take the place of the ATS.

I can handle the styling though I don't think it looks as good as my car, except for that C-pillar design which is absolutely hideous. Reminiscent of the current Buick Regal Sportback which GM can't seem to give away. Should never made it out of the design center."
11,2019-03-18T15:56:39+00:00,thebean,"To my unsophisticated eye, the CT5 kinda has a Tesla Model 3 look in the side view."
12,2019-03-18T16:31:04+00:00,tjc78,I definitely see a little previous generation Accord in the C pillar area.
13,2019-03-18T16:38:48+00:00,texases,"Current one, too (except the Accord's window is real), along with overall 'fastback' shape:"
14,2019-03-18T16:57:52+00:00,fintail,Rear door from an Ion or Cruze? Can't un-see
15,2019-03-18T17:19:28+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"Seems a bit underwhelming. Maybe in ""real life"" it would look better. On the other hand, not offensive in any way. Sorta plain vanilla with a few chocolate jimmies on top."
16,2019-03-18T18:33:23+00:00,ab348,Exactly. It should be so lucky to look like an Accord in that area.
17,2019-03-18T21:10:59+00:00,andres3,"Absolutely true about being ""TOO LOYAL."" However, until they make unreliable crap cars, they will continue to be loyal, because they are loyal about the legendary trouble-free ownership experience. It is reliability and durability that keeps them coming back for more, not the grounded to the ground driving feel."
18,2019-03-18T21:16:45+00:00,tlong,I saw this on the road and grabbed a quick shot. I have no idea what it is.
19,2019-03-18T21:33:43+00:00,fintail,Looks like a 51 Ford Victoria. New 68 years ago
20,2019-03-19T22:33:44+00:00,qbrozen,THis one is not new either but it is sitting outside my son’s dojo right now.
21,2019-03-20T06:37:40+00:00,tlong,"I was recently in Chile for the first time and I saw this truck in Santiago.
Chinese vehicles are definitely happening - this wasn't a rare find."
22,2019-03-20T12:03:55+00:00,stickguy,I’d but something called a “Wingle”. Fun name!
23,2019-03-20T15:16:38+00:00,qbrozen,"My question is: with the 3 different names on there, which is the manufacturer, model, and trim? Is it a Denco Great Wall Wingle 5? A Great Wall Wingle 5 in Denco trim? A Wingle 5 Denco Great Wall? ...."
24,2019-03-20T15:18:19+00:00,kyfdx,"I'm pretty sure that Great Wall is the make, Wingle 5 is the model.
CRDi is common rail diesel

Not familiar with Derco, unless it's a parent company to Great Wall"
25,2019-03-20T15:19:12+00:00,kyfdx,"Yesterday, Lexus IS 250 AWD F-Sport

It had a lot of crap on the back, as well."
26,2019-03-20T15:23:00+00:00,andres3,The fit and finish looks Chinese like... the bumper isn't level.
27,2019-03-20T15:51:37+00:00,tlong,I'm pretty sure it had been banged up a bit.
28,2019-03-20T15:55:41+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,I don't expect life is easy for a working truck in Chile.
29,2019-03-20T19:01:24+00:00,tifighter,I saw a ton of those Great Wall trucks in Chile. They have to be eating market share in SA. Nissan still seemed pretty popular.
30,2019-03-20T20:53:56+00:00,explorerx4,"Those can't be backup sensors on the bumper, right?"
31,2019-03-20T20:58:16+00:00,Michaell,"Couldn't ""Denco"" or ""Derco"" be the dealer name?"

Have only seen one of those so far (bright blue, subtle and classy), also saw a G550 4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4 with all kinds of signage, apparently used in some kind of rally. Biggest difference from the Seattle zoo is the amount of X2s - they are everywhere here."
34,2019-03-21T15:36:16+00:00,Michaell,Is the X2 available with different engines north of the border?
35,2019-03-21T15:39:12+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"There's a Brit on YouTube ranting about all the troubles with his new McLaren. In 7 months, he's been able to drive the car 21 days."
36,2019-03-21T16:07:33+00:00,ab348,That sounds like Clarkson a few years ago when he bought his GT40.

38,2019-03-22T04:26:02+00:00,fintail,"If there are any engine variances on the X2, they are minor. No diesel or anything else interesting.

Went to the Vancouver auto show today, kind of a letdown - no MB, no BMW, Kind of weird, but I know MB has skipped out here in the past, and other places recently. The rest of the show had normal stuff as expected. I was impressed with the luxury spec Dodge truck, pretty nice rig. White was not a color I would pick for a display Avalon, but Toyota thought it was a good idea. A purple Mirage was good for a laugh, and the Nissan Micra is fun to see. Some car, I think a lower model Hyunkia or Mitsu CUV, had iffy fit and finish on some exterior trim, not good for a show car. In the exotic section saw the Marie Antoinette Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a couple McLaren Senna, various Lambo and Ferrari etc. Exchange rates make some things decent for Murkan tourists right now, too."
39,2019-03-22T13:14:39+00:00,texases,"I may go to the Dallas show this weekend. Also no BMW, which happened before, but MB will be there. No Mini this year, guess BMW's cutting back everything."
40,2019-03-22T13:30:24+00:00,stickguy,"Philly also had no BMW this year. That’s a big show so I was surprised.

MB was there, but they always have a huge display. Ditto Lexus. Those 2 have a hall by themselves. MB had at least 12-15 cars.

Caddy was the other big name brand missing."

5,2019-03-24T12:15:39+00:00,ab348,"The shade of blue immediately above looks fine, as does a dark blue. It is the brilliantly bright Subaru/HyunKia blue that looks wrong.

Colors on Ferraris are interesting. A few years ago on Carini's TV show he did over a Ferrari Daytona that was the traditional red and in doing the body prep discovered it was originally green, Verde Pino. It got repainted in its original color and I thought it would look terrible but it actually was quite attractive."
6,2019-03-24T14:26:30+00:00,qbrozen,I think that is awful. Looks like a Miata Or ‘80s vette.

12,2019-03-24T20:47:47+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,They aren't worth much more than that now--maybe $35K. It's the cheapest Ferrari you can buy.

I find the shape attractive and non-offensive (*cough* Nissan/Lexus *cough*), and the variety of engines should appeal to a wide audience, as well.

What is interesting is the inclusion of cylinder deactivation on the base 1.5L 3-cylinder engine. I suppose if you live in Florida or Kansas and never encounter a hill, running on 2 cylinders might be OK. Not sure how I'd feel about it here in Colorado."
35,2019-04-02T20:14:13+00:00,explorerx4,"The Focus plant capacity has already been replaced by the Ranger, so I don't think the Escape has to pick up much of the volume slack from it.
Ford's main goal now is vehicle profit margin, Focus wasn't contributing much to that."
36,2019-04-02T20:16:11+00:00,fintail,"Someone in my building has a new Accord, and I've also noticed a new X3 hanging around. And then there's that wagon"
37,2019-04-02T20:35:22+00:00,stickguy,"cylinder deactivation seems like a silly idea on an engine that small. So much complexity, probably compromised driving dynamics, and probably little to no real world improvement. Better off going with the hybrid."
38,2019-04-02T20:48:13+00:00,tjc78,"I’m not a fan of cylinder deactivation.  The Tahoe at work has it and you can absolutely tell when it kicks off to accelerate or climb a hill.  Almost feels like a little hesitation.  

On theinstant economy meter it tells you “V8” or “V4”.  "
39,2019-04-02T22:54:54+00:00,ab348,I’m not sure if the 3.6 V6 in the ATS has it or not. I will have to check.
40,2019-04-02T23:07:22+00:00,tjc78,I don’t think so... I’ve had three GM 3.6s and none of them had it. 
41,2019-04-02T23:11:12+00:00,ab348,"Hmm. Apparently it does. I have never noticed it.

42,2019-04-02T23:16:24+00:00,tjc78,"Wow, guess it’s only on the Caddy’s.  "
43,2019-04-03T00:18:50+00:00,sda,"Our Pilot has cylinder deactivation. It can switch down to 3 cylinders. When it does it often feels like a subtle gear shift, and it sometimes creates a minor rumble and slight vibration in the cabin. It can be a little annoying and depending on the differing grade of the road will go in and out of ECO frequently. I am not convinced it provides an improvement in gas mileage and wish I could manually override it."
44,2019-04-03T00:55:38+00:00,stickguy,"I noticed it sometimes on our Oddessy (a 2005, so first year of VCM). Plus it had the Eco light. The RDX, really not noticeable at all. and no Eco light to make you think it is on."
45,2019-04-03T00:57:16+00:00,stickguy,"there are a number of people that think it causes problems. There are ""muzzlers"" available that you can put on the car that trick it into not ever switching the VCM on. The claim it fixes a lot of problems. with little to no MPG penalty."
46,2019-04-03T01:17:44+00:00,explorerx4,I'm happy with stop/start since I sit at some traffic lights that take a while to change.
47,2019-04-03T01:47:02+00:00,laurasdada,"I have no issues with the stop/start in my car, I don't find it obtrusive."
48,2019-04-03T03:26:51+00:00,stickguy,"for some reason, even though it was an extensive redesign for 2018, the TLX does not have that feature. I don't mind not having it though!"
49,2019-04-03T11:10:51+00:00,qbrozen,I often can’t tell when mine turns off. I only notice when I lift my foot and it starts back up again. It does not seem to be as quick on the startup as my F150 was and I can get a little jolt from it.
0,2019-04-03T13:25:47+00:00,fintail,"I've noticed it is less obtrusive on the wagon than the Bluetec, probably because of engine NVH (the 6 is virtually imperceptible at warm idle). Response is instant anyway."
1,2019-04-03T23:09:40+00:00,explorerx4,"@fintail,
You better not leave that hockey equipment in the car, no trunk to isolate it."
2,2019-04-04T02:11:47+00:00,fintail,"Oh I've already thought about that, I am somewhat of a neat freak about my cars, and smells would put me off. The cargo cover will also be in place whenever the gear is back there.

On the new car front, I saw a brand new X5 today, pretty sure it wasn't an X7."
3,2019-04-05T01:50:48+00:00,andres3,"GLC300, the new popular MB cute-ute in Southern CA.

I saw a Youtube video comparing the usual suspects for decent size (but not big) SUV's, including:
Acura RDX
Volvo XC60
MB GLC300
Audi Q5
BMW X3
Was a pretty good review of the strengths and weaknesses, though a little excessively positive for all of them.

Basically luxury = MB & Audi

Sport = Acura & BMW

Off Road = Volvo"
4,2019-04-05T02:00:08+00:00,stickguy,"I like all of those. Depending on budget, they would all be on the look at list when it's time to replace my TLX."

He also reminded me the all-important survey should arrive within a week, and I assured him he'll be fine. He has followed through with his promises, and communicated much better than other local dealers I contacted before the purchase."
9,2019-04-06T04:03:04+00:00,texases,"I was surprised there were no GLCs at the Dallas car show.  Most other MBs, though. "
10,2019-04-06T05:05:44+00:00,Michaell,"MB was a no-show in Denver.

Wife does like the GLC - at least, from the rear. Not that we're in the market for anything; she likes the Outback too much."
11,2019-04-06T13:17:06+00:00,kyfdx,MB was about the only make with no display at the Cincinnati show.
12,2019-04-06T13:24:00+00:00,stickguy,guy across the street from me has a GLC. A year or 2 ago it replaced a GLK. I like the C. Looks good.
13,2019-04-06T14:26:24+00:00,kyfdx,"It is in the generic mid-size SUV sweet spot. X3, GLC, RDX, Q5. All incredibly popular. My wife is now on her third one. I like the GLC look, as well."
14,2019-04-06T16:23:38+00:00,fintail,"MB was absent at the Vancouver show as well, which is either surprising or not, as the brand is yuuuuge there. At one point maybe 20 years ago, I think it had some weird stat like the most S-class per capita in NA or something."

Easily the most popular segment "
16,2019-04-07T11:59:25+00:00,stickguy,"makes sense. I consider that to be the most practical, especially for a single car family. We would never give up having some sort of box vehicle in the fleet! The RDX is not the most efficient design style wise (back is a bit rounded, not really square) but it still holds a ton for something the length of a prior generation Jetta or a current Civic."
17,2019-04-08T01:54:13+00:00,jpp75,"Cadillac was also a no show, but I doubt anyone noticed or cared.

@Michaell I can't fault her for liking the Outback, it's one of those vehicles that does everything right and would be hard to replace. The GLC may be nicer in some respects but you all have the better car all around."
18,2019-04-08T02:03:19+00:00,Michaell,"Curbside classic had a nice review of the Denver Auto show; worth a read.

We loaded up the Outback with everything they needed to attend a summer camp fair today. Swallowed it all with room to spare. I need to spend some time cleaning up the interior; the leather could use some attention."
19,2019-04-09T15:08:10+00:00,kyfdx,Wife’s co-worker. She says it sounds great

22,2019-04-09T15:51:10+00:00,Michaell,"Is it a debadged GT, or is it an EcoBoost?"
23,2019-04-09T16:05:24+00:00,kyfdx,It is a Bullitt
24,2019-04-09T16:11:30+00:00,texases,That's some big brakes...

27,2019-04-09T16:49:41+00:00,ab348,I don't think that's black. It looks to me like it has a very small dollop of green in it.
28,2019-04-09T16:54:16+00:00,explorerx4,"I wasn't sure if it was a Bullitt, so I thought maybe GT with performance pack.
You can get the Bullitt in black or green."

30,2019-04-09T17:55:37+00:00,kyfdx,"Yeah, it's black.

I would pick green, though that last pic makes it seem lighter than real life, I think"
31,2019-04-09T17:58:54+00:00,kyfdx,"Very few cars catch my eye, that I would conceivably purchase, given my budget.

Mustang GT
VW GTI
Porsche Cayman

(not necessarily new... again: budget)"
32,2019-04-09T18:24:01+00:00,ab348,The black rear panel and the blackout over the license plate look black. The paint does not.
33,2019-04-09T18:26:43+00:00,kyfdx,"Well, since my wife took the picture, it's black. Not really a question. ;-)"
34,2019-04-09T18:48:46+00:00,ab348,"I would have expected it to look more like this, but whatever. Maybe it drove through a cloud of pollen.




Why anyone would order a Bullit Mustang in black remains a mystery to me."
35,2019-04-09T18:50:54+00:00,kyfdx,"I've been looking for a picture that more accurately shows the Green color, but most of them are too big for this forum. This one is closer (IMO)."

37,2019-04-13T02:39:00+00:00,fintail,"Saw 3 new style X5 in about 20 minutes today, which given the neighborhood probably isn't remarkable."

39,2019-04-13T16:01:46+00:00,Michaell,"Given how poor the lease program is, I'm not."
40,2019-04-13T23:26:30+00:00,fintail,"Worse than an E wagon?

For a second today I thought I saw a new style G Wagen, but it wasn't."
41,2019-04-13T23:28:03+00:00,Michaell,"Ok, maybe not that bad"
42,2019-04-14T04:56:07+00:00,fintail,"Maybe not brand new but newish, but saw another E wagon on the road today, it was even white (but sport trim). This makes 1 other wagon I have seen on the road since I got mine 2 weeks ago tomorrow. I like that kind of thing."
43,2019-04-14T06:35:12+00:00,bhill2,Saw a fairly new (early 2000's) E wagon today parked in front of our house. My best description of the color would be metallic liver. Not a beautiful choice.

Co-worker of mine has a 13 Rogue, bought as a low mileage demo. She beats the hell out of it, even using it for farm duty, and has ~90K on it now. It has had zero issues."
0,2019-04-27T01:40:12+00:00,Michaell,"And that's why they are popular. Not flashy, but dependable. They've been offering the CVT for a while, so it's likely dialed in, engineering wise."

Anyone who drove it, hated it."

3,2019-04-28T02:57:13+00:00,qbrozen,Saw my first new s60 in the wild today. Sharp car. The s90 design language carried over well.
4,2019-04-28T03:35:21+00:00,stickguy,I think it looks better. the S90 just looks too stretched out to me (like someone pulled taffy)
5,2019-04-28T14:48:30+00:00,Mr_Shiftright,"S90 looks pretty large in real life, doesn't it?"
6,2019-04-29T01:21:59+00:00,fintail,"Saw an X7 today. Reminded me of a local ad, where a spokeswoman exclaims it is the ""biggest BMW ever!"" or something similar. Is that really something to be proud of?

Also saw a couple of E wagons, new style but not sure of year. One was an E63, other a red sport trim model. I wonder if my car even has an exact twin, I have some doubt."
7,2019-04-29T21:35:49+00:00,explorerx4,I've seem a couple of new Foresters lately. Seems bigger.

16,2019-05-08T21:12:27+00:00,andres3,"There's still a lot of Big 3 apologists online (Facebook for example) where this story was posted, and the usual argument is that the problems on the FCA car are exaggerated, and that if it was a ""German/Japanese"" car, the problems would have been completely overlooked.

Not really sure why these alternate reality viewpoints get argued online; don't they realize they won't convince former owners? Someone that has avoided a brand based solely on word of mouth, perhaps, but not former owners that know the truth."
17,2019-05-08T22:58:29+00:00,berri,"I saw a pretty new Maserati sedan today. Like the Alfa, I think these are vehicles that each get a different response depending on their color. Kind of unique that way I think."
18,2019-05-09T03:06:37+00:00,stickguy,"I saw another Benley SUV this week in Charleston. Just, a box.

23,2019-05-12T01:24:42+00:00,qbrozen,Saw my first XT4 in person. Really caught my eye. Sharp car. It is a shame they didn't put enough power under the hood.
24,2019-05-12T01:32:54+00:00,fintail,"I'm a ways from the city this weekend, seems the new car status symbol of choice here is a loaded Tundra - seen many more of these with recent plates than similar domestics."

I can’t get Mom away from the things.  At least this generation is nicer looking.  "
26,2019-05-13T23:02:58+00:00,explorerx4,"Saw a Telluride,
Like someone mentioned earlier, not as big as I thought it was.
Looked ok, like a Volvo in the back.
Back from our 1200 mile round trip to Ohio. Saw a total of 2 Tesla's being driven.
Did see a car carrier with 1/2 a dozen or so on it. There was a red Model S that looked pretty good.
It was 39 degrees @3pm in PA. Now I see possible snow here in CT overnight? WTH?"

Just walked the dog, and grabbed a pair of gloves out of the closet. crazy, considering next week is prime time to start opening pools."
29,2019-05-14T03:26:46+00:00,fintail,Saw a new style Z4
30,2019-05-14T04:43:10+00:00,Michaell,And what did you think?

I suspect the Supra variant might have those more."

35,2019-05-14T14:16:51+00:00,qbrozen,It is a hatchback
36,2019-05-14T14:20:20+00:00,texases,"Yeah, I was just about to come here and correct that. The only pic I could find on the Audi site seemed to show a trunk support on the cropped photo, but I've since found other pics."

39,2019-05-14T19:53:04+00:00,fintail,"I've seen 2015 model Ghibli (virtually indistinguishable from a new one) down to around 25K now. I still wouldn't go for it.

When I was used G-Wagen browsing, I did notice many were in TX, including a blue one I actually inquired about, but it had sold a few hours prior."
40,2019-05-14T21:18:01+00:00,thebean,"@texases, I don’t think I’ve seen any more than one or two G-wagons here in several years of looking. I see quite a few older ones when we go to Santa Fe, which makes sense as a company there was the sole importer of gray market ones for a long while before MB started offering them stateside."
41,2019-05-14T21:42:34+00:00,texases,"I'm seeing 1 or more a week here, sometimes 2 in a day."
42,2019-05-15T10:45:11+00:00,qbrozen,Can get a 2012 QP for even a few bucks less. I’d much rather opt for that.
43,2019-05-15T13:42:27+00:00,fintail,"I might save up and get a new style one, not insanely more expensive (I think 2014s can easily be found well under 40K), and maybe easier to live with.

48,2019-05-15T18:35:06+00:00,ab348,I saw a M-B A250 hatch today in traffic for the first time. I was surprised at how good it looked.
49,2019-05-16T02:14:55+00:00,fintail,"Something else, like the C and E53 wagons seen in Loonieland that apparently are too cool for Murka."
0,2019-05-16T12:53:04+00:00,ab348,"Ah, I wasn't sure if they were sold south of the border or not. Certainly looked much better than the old B-series bread vans they tried selling here 10 years or so back.

A-class:






B-class:"
1,2019-05-16T12:54:17+00:00,stickguy,I like that A class. Sharp.
2,2019-05-16T13:05:23+00:00,ab348,"The only thing about the A-class I am iffy about is the dash, which looks like several other current MB models. I actually like the ""glass cockpit"" digital instruments and screens, but the round vents, the shiny black plastic and some other parts look a bit boy-racerish to me and I'm not a fan of the look."
3,2019-05-16T13:20:29+00:00,fintail,"That specific vent design is a coupe thing, I think MB is trying to inject the pretense of sport into the car - the brand has been doing that throughout the range, and I can't say I support it all. That car also has the fancier style steering wheel also seen in coupes and AMG models, and it's a nice unit.

The full digital gauges being standard is a cool thing and a hint at the future. I think the display may be unique to this model, as it seems shorter in height than the screen in the E or S. The screen being very exposed with a thin bezel makes me a little leery.

The B eventually came to the US, but only as an electric, and I think it has been a slow seller."
4,2019-05-17T13:34:01+00:00,fintail,Saw 2x new Navigators on the road yesterday. Bling bling.
5,2019-05-17T15:10:08+00:00,qbrozen,Saw a Stelvio. Nothing special ... until it drove past me. It was a quadrifoglio.
6,2019-05-17T20:27:09+00:00,explorerx4,"Saw a GMC pickup with that multi function tailgate. Pricy truck.
Also, a new Leaf parked across the street. Much more mainstream looking now."
7,2019-05-17T22:09:57+00:00,thebean,"Saw a new Lexus LS500 today. Wow, have they made their flagship sedan low. I think it was about as low as the wife’s Civic, which is not easy for me to get into."
8,2019-05-18T01:33:08+00:00,fintail,"Saw a BMW X7, ,""driver"" had a phone in their hand because of course. Also saw a new style G-Wagen, I think only the 2nd or 3rd I've seen on the road."
9,2019-05-18T09:25:45+00:00,tjc78,Guess they didn’t order Bluetooth.
10,2019-05-18T13:43:17+00:00,ab348,"Maybe they couldn't figure out how to pair it in iDrive, or perhaps the dealer needs to register the phone with the car first and they hadn't gotten around to that yet."
11,2019-05-18T15:37:41+00:00,fintail,"It's amazing how many late model higher end cars apparently lack Bluetooth.

I suspect it was either a case of a phone not having gone through a $500 registration process as ab348 mentions, or that combination of entitled laziness which might follow certain vehicle models. I have some doubts any LEOs in this area are going to give that citation."
12,2019-05-18T16:28:47+00:00,explorerx4,"some of it is, I think that people don't want their cars spying on them.
Just another way to monetize your data."
13,2019-05-18T16:29:01+00:00,tjc78,I really don’t think much of anything except maybe a base model cargo van doesn’t have BT these days. 
14,2019-05-18T16:39:53+00:00,fintail,"My sister's 2012 Sonic had BT. Every passenger car has it now, I suspect.

My car can spy on me all it wants, joke's on them, there's nothing of value in my satellite radio listening or on the rare event I take a call while driving. If people really have that paranoia, time to navigate away from infowars"
15,2019-05-18T19:18:20+00:00,tjc78,"2 Genesis G80 and a Lincoln Nautilus.

Saw what you want about Lincoln.  Their SUV lineup is excellent, IMO "

17,2019-05-19T17:56:04+00:00,fintail,"Saw a 2020 Corolla today. Exactly what one would expect - over-aggressive face, bland profile, and it even has C-pillar DLO fail. It should continue to sell to fleets and those who don't like cars."
18,2019-05-19T22:01:28+00:00,tjc78,"Yeah, the Corolla is bad.... but that is Toyota now.  Take it or leave it.  "

one of my neighbors seems to have gotten a new BMW 440 coupe (2 door). Black. Looks sharp. Also a new temp tag range rover Velar. Though there was already one in the 'Hood (same black color) so either there is a copy cat or he got a replacement for some reason."

2,2019-06-05T20:43:39+00:00,tjc78,"If you think about it... shouldn't the tire with the larger rim opening be cheaper?

If two tires are exactly the same height and width, but one has a 17"" opening and the other has a 20"" opening, doesn't the 20"" tire have less rubber?

Am I missing something?"

Might be more expensive to make. But most likely, it’s a vestige of when big tires were low production, so had to cost more. People expect it, and will pay it, so they charge it."
4,2019-06-05T21:05:36+00:00,explorerx4,"In the parking lot at work, a few new cars. The only one I can remember is a gray M235i convertible.

My truck has 22's and the tires are a long way from replacement."
5,2019-06-05T22:00:52+00:00,kyfdx,"Most of the higher diameter tires are also wider (though, they wouldn't have to be). Most vehicles that go with 19"" wheels standard, also increase the overall size, it seems, as well. (relative to the old model with smaller wheels).

My wife's car has a 19"" wheel option (vs. standard 18""), which was one option I could do without."
6,2019-06-05T22:05:29+00:00,andres3,"It's a bit more then that. It takes more high-tech, engineering, and manufacturing exactness to make a skinny sidewall support, say a 96 load rating and meet the speed rating specs, than it does to work with a beefier bigger sidewall tire. Almost all tires these days are XL for extra load because cars are heavier and sidewalls are skinnier. Also, bigger tires tend to weigh more, despite the bigger hole in the middle, a lot of times because a bigger hole in the middle indicates a bigger tire around, and they tend to be wider.

Now if only they could get the ratio of price to be the same as the ratio of wheel size. For instance, get a 20"" tire to cost 20/19ths what a 19"" tire costs in the same size. That would be preferable to the current pricing scheme."
7,2019-06-05T22:27:40+00:00,berri,"Sales volume also comes into play I think. If you sell less of certain sizes, their fixed and semi-fixed costs like molds and transportation are spread over a smaller base incurring individual tire cost increases."
8,2019-06-05T22:37:25+00:00,tjc78,"I think a lot of the points are valid, but I’d bet dollars to donuts they are simply more expensive because they are perceived “better” and the public will pay. 

I bet the auto auto makers added cost is negligible "
9,2019-06-05T22:57:18+00:00,kyfdx,"Go to Tirerack.com and check the weight of a 19"" tire, vs. an 18"" option on the same vehicle.

I still think it makes business sense to at least have 2 sedans. a small/medium, and a medium/large. Like a Jetta/Passat if you don't want too small, or Elantra/Sonata. Do it right, and will be 2 lengths of the same basic car so cheaper to produce."

If that turns out to be true, the future may be back to cars or electric/hybrid. Japan isn't dropping minivans right now due to their potential if driver-less becomes a reality. Also, it seems young drivers are often buying cars rather than crossovers, at least initially. Time will tell I guess."

They have been made since the start of G production, although examples from the 90s onward were sold for luxury more than utility, and even 90s ones will cost you a pretty penny, you won't get one for under 50K.

I've seen maybe 5 new Corollas in the past day, all but one a rental, one rental had a crooked front plate looking like it could fail at any time - what is it with rental cars and messed up front plates? Maybe aggressive car washes."
10,2019-07-22T22:05:04+00:00,explorerx4,GT. When I added the convertible I dropped the T.
11,2019-07-23T01:03:09+00:00,fintail,"Ah, that makes more sense

Speaking of that, walking back after dropping off the old car last night, I passed by several body shops. In one of the front lots was a new G63 AMG - wonder what happened to it. I saw no obvious damage."
12,2019-07-25T21:39:11+00:00,stickguy,New gladiator. I really liked it. Wife thought I was nuts.
13,2019-07-25T22:08:03+00:00,Michaell,Is it bigger than it looks in pictures? I've not seen one in the wild yet.
14,2019-07-25T22:34:46+00:00,qbrozen,"I actually think it is smaller than it looks in pics. Pics (to me) make it look full-size, like F150. Reality is more like Dakota."
15,2019-07-25T22:49:28+00:00,explorerx4,"Have not seen a Gladiator on the road, but the dealer close to me has a few.
I think they look a little off."
16,2019-07-26T03:20:47+00:00,stickguy,It seemed small IRL.
17,2019-07-26T03:42:36+00:00,tifighter,"Visually the Gladiator looks really long. Probably since the Wrangler is narrow (and tall) anyhow, but I saw a white one yesterday cross an intersection and thought I was at a rail crossing."
18,2019-07-26T03:57:49+00:00,fintail,Saw another X7 today - not sure how well these will fare when the new GLS hits the road. Also so many new Corollas every day now that they have stopped being new.
19,2019-07-27T02:28:16+00:00,laurasdada,"As posted elsewhere, today within a few minutes: Aston Martin DB11, two Ferrari California and a 458 Italia. Nice to be reminded regularly of my epic career and financial mistakes."

21,2019-07-30T20:37:18+00:00,qbrozen,I may be missing it ... why is it too expensive? Seems to be right in line with the Q7/XC90/GX460/Aviator
22,2019-07-30T20:55:00+00:00,stickguy,"nice looking. tons of content. Too big for me, and quite the porker! But, after reading the review, sounds like the XT5 is getting a serious makeover too so that should be a good option in the ~190"" 5 seater class."
23,2019-07-30T21:21:58+00:00,ab348,That’s a standard auto writer line these days for any Cadillac. They seem to perceive them as equivalent to Hondas or something.
24,2019-07-30T21:28:14+00:00,explorerx4,"Just don't park one of those XT6's next to a Telluride.
I have yet to see any other than at best a tepid review of the XT6."
25,2019-07-30T21:34:53+00:00,fintail,"I was going to say, I see a dose of Telluride or even a little XC90 there."
26,2019-07-30T21:51:46+00:00,qbrozen,"I could be wrong, but I think a review of any 3-row SUV is tepid. Or maybe that’s just my personal bias."
27,2019-07-30T22:08:04+00:00,explorerx4,"@qbrozen,
You'll have to try out the new Explorer or Aviator.
They are back to an RWD architecture and have some pretty big power options available.
Don't pick on the wrong model at a stoplight, it might not be like an XT6 which has a Malibu engine."
28,2019-07-30T22:50:13+00:00,ab348,"The 3.6 that's in the XT6 was never available in the Malibu. It didn't offer a V-6 after 2012 and this one is a new engine.

Every Lincoln introduced over the last number of years has elicited similar enthusiastic responses from its fans. Every Lincoln introduced over the last number of years has flopped in the marketplace."
29,2019-07-31T00:21:44+00:00,explorerx4,"@ab348,
My bad, should have written Impala/XTS.
It's not about where product has been, but where it's going.
Read some Explorer/Aviator reviews and see what the XT6 is up against."

33,2019-07-31T19:37:43+00:00,berri,"The MKC will be replaced by the upcoming Lincoln Corsair. Nautilus doesn't seem to get reviewers excited, but the upcoming Aviator does. Same for the prototype Corsair . But Lincoln, and the new Ford Explorer may have a pricing problem. I'd hold off until they've been out for awhile, or maybe better yet, buy one used down the road."
34,2019-07-31T19:42:07+00:00,berri,"When I look at these crossovers, I'm not sure you need to pay lux prices anymore with some of the new 2020's coming out. HyunKia may be especially hard to beat with the Telluride and Palisade. Seems like strong reviews and an excellent value. I guess the market will tell. Regardless, I think the differences are shrinking between lux and non lux crossovers, especially when you look at features."
35,2019-08-03T15:42:44+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Palisade in traffic yesterday (have seen numerous Telluride already), I have to say these look like a pretty good value, upmarket appearance."

37,2019-08-03T21:57:29+00:00,ab348,"Arteon. I saw my first ahead of me in traffic just yesterday. Nice-looking design, but knowing the price point I had to ask myself ""Why would anyone buy one of those?""."
38,2019-08-03T23:52:38+00:00,stickguy,the one in the showroom (R line I think) stickered at $45K. Getting up there.
39,2019-08-04T01:13:04+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new style Explorer on the road, looked to be on a test drive."
40,2019-08-04T19:50:51+00:00,kyfdx,"For $350K+, you can have one, too"
41,2019-08-04T19:56:14+00:00,explorerx4,Is that an early 70's Celica on the right side of the picture?
42,2019-08-04T19:58:46+00:00,kyfdx,"It is. Didn’t get a picture, as I see it at every car gathering, here. I guess I’m used to it."
43,2019-08-04T20:02:00+00:00,fintail,Celica is more interesting to me than the R-R.

46,2019-08-05T17:37:23+00:00,thebean,"At the gym today, a S-Class wannabe (at least according to @driver100) Genesis G90. I don’t believe it’s a wannabe. I briefly talked to the owner and he has had it for two months and loves it. It’s the twin turbo V6 and he said it’s plenty fast for him. I looked over it and the fit/finish looked superb. Panel gaps consistent and the paint was super deep looking. The only thing he is regretting slightly is getting black on black here in Texas. This week we are due for a string of 100 degree days with humidity."
47,2019-08-05T17:43:02+00:00,ab348,I don’t understand the appeal of black on black.
48,2019-08-05T17:44:32+00:00,texases,"Me neither, but lots of cars are hard to find with anything besides a black interior. Wish it was otherwise..."
49,2019-08-05T18:33:57+00:00,ab348,Tell me about it. Virtually no dealers here will stock anything other than a black interior. Manufacturers like Kia only offer black interiors in the Canadian market despite offering alternatives in other markets.
0,2019-08-05T18:57:08+00:00,fintail,"I like how the US vs Canadian market weirdness is still a thing. I think MB does it best, offering numerous models in Canada not seen south of the border, and with significantly different options structures."
1,2019-08-05T21:11:23+00:00,berri,"I wonder if all this black inside is about covering up cheap materials? On the outside, my personal experience has been that white is actually easier to keep looking good than black, even in northern winter climates."
2,2019-08-05T21:40:05+00:00,ab348,"Yes, my experience is that black may not show accumulated dirt on the seats from the occupants clothing, but shows every speck of dust, lint and hair."
3,2019-08-05T22:34:03+00:00,tifighter,"My wife likes coffee. Regularly, she likes to share it with the interior. Black works pretty well for us."
4,2019-08-06T00:07:41+00:00,sda,"Black leather seems to hide most soil sins the best. Black cloth can look spotted, faded and dingy. And, yes all lint and everything else shows on the upholstery and carpet. And it is dark and hot. Did I say HOT?"
5,2019-08-06T01:11:43+00:00,berri,"I also think black hides cheap quality plastic better than beige, or even grey."
6,2019-08-06T02:02:13+00:00,fintail,"Every single rental car I've had in Germany has been equipped with black interior, making me once think it was a German thing. But it is probably just an easy cleaning thing - the dust is easy to wipe off, and the real dirt is harder to see.

On the road today - 2x new GLE, Corolla hatch, Mazda 3 non-blind spot edition, new Panamera, new A8 at work."
7,2019-08-06T12:19:58+00:00,tjc78,"My favorite combo is dark floors, but light seats and headliner. Best of both worlds, IMO."

Saw an i-Pace or whatever the electric Jag CUV is called."
11,2019-08-06T21:54:01+00:00,berri,I'm kind of surprised that either one of those dealers can successfully play hardball in the PNW metro areas. More about German's and Japan in that segment.
12,2019-08-07T03:31:22+00:00,fintail,"I don't think they do it successfully. At the time my friend was interested, the CT6 hybrid model he wanted was new and rare, so they played hardball. Check resale on those, my friend is now considering a used one, as he has another car (Fusion, sibling to his MKZ but he doesn't like it) he wants to get out of."
13,2019-08-08T10:40:49+00:00,sda,"If I recall he had some initial issues with the MKZ and with this being his second one, I imagine he is getting bored with it and ready for a change. I remember replacing my 96 Mazda Millenia 24 mo lease for a 98 Millenia purchase, and being meh. Though nothing wrong with the car I replaced it within 16 months."
14,2019-08-08T13:21:52+00:00,fintail,"Yep, my friend had a bunch of MKZ teething issues, but the dealer set it right and the car has been flawless since. He actually likes the thing, and I think plans to keep it for awhile, but the Fusion bought as a commuter or something for his other half hasn't warmed his heart. The MKZ is green on green and has virtually all options, probably a pretty rare car.

Spotted a new SL63 yesterday evening."
15,2019-08-09T02:17:15+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new style Soul GT today, don't recall having seen one on the road before."
16,2019-08-11T04:17:11+00:00,andres3,I can vouch that the leather in the expensive VW is far better than that in the most expensive Tiguan (SLE Premium).
17,2019-08-11T15:59:10+00:00,explorerx4,"Saw a new Honda Passport. Supposed to be more off roady than a Pilot and the body does look like it sits higher, but the rear lower control arms are very low. Kind of reminds me of the 2006-2010 Explorer rear suspension."

29,2019-08-14T01:12:03+00:00,kyfdx,I think the Q8 looks good. Sportier than a Q7.
30,2019-08-14T01:57:50+00:00,tifighter,Agreed. I'm not saying the Q8 is bad. I'm saying they look nearly identical. I bet the sales guy at the dealer walks up to a Q8 with the e-tron key all the time. And vice versa. They are the same size.

The manufacturers may be better off with small showrooms in retail areas where people can test drive a vehicle and order one directly. The trade in function can really be handled by the Carmax's of the world these days. Manufacturer's can also set up warranty contracts with repair shops they certify. It just doesn't seem essential in today's market to have large, costly dealerships and their often offensive F&I people."

18,2019-08-27T17:58:58+00:00,ab348,"Saw a new-style E450 wagon in traffic locally, Selenite Gray outside, black inside. Impressive-looking vehicle though the paint color didn't do much for me. Seriously expensive here, probably well north of $80K in worthless Canadian dollars."
19,2019-08-27T20:15:28+00:00,explorerx4,"How about a chrome wrapped Model X? Yes, they do exist."
20,2019-08-27T20:23:29+00:00,fintail,"You can load em up well past $90K in overvalued greenbacks. Funny, with exchange rate shenanigans and different option groupings, such cars spec for spec are often a bit cheaper north of the border."

33,2019-09-05T00:21:56+00:00,imidazol97,"I've seen a few of those that blink 3 times and then switch to steady burn. I assumed they were manufacturer OEM on certain models.

The first car that I saw that did something similar was a Mercedes maybe 15 years ago. The taillights blinked once brighter than normal as the brake pedal was depressed. This is long ago, but it seemed I read something about that occurred if the brake was hit harder than average as in an emergency stop mode."

36,2019-09-06T01:16:09+00:00,sda,"I always liked those, and they even had a plaid interior like the later GTI. I’ve owned multiple VWs from 79-06. I had a good relationship with a VW salesman that I bought or referred to many times. When ever a new model would be introduced he would call or send me a note to come drive it. When the Corrado was introduced and had the supercharged engine I was excited to drive it. It was coarse and not very satisfying to drive and was expecting much more. What a difference the VR6 made!"
37,2019-09-06T14:30:26+00:00,laurasdada,"My '78 was white over black, with Recaro seats. I was none too pleased that VW took styling in house for the second gen Scirocco, the exterior was a bit too bulbous for me. The most recent iterations look pretty good, though!"
38,2019-09-06T14:31:55+00:00,kyfdx,"My biggest regret from 1977, is that I didn't steal $1000, so that I could get a Scirocco, instead of a Cobra II"

I loved my Scirocco, as did rust. So light and tossable. Purty, too."
41,2019-09-06T16:17:59+00:00,Michaell,"I could've used that same $1000 in 1991 to get a Sentra SE-R, rather than the SE I ended up getting"

44,2019-09-06T19:42:11+00:00,stickguy,"same here. $1k might have upgraded me from the 1985 Colt GTS (turbo package, sans turbo) to a GTI or Corolla SR5"
45,2019-09-06T20:46:22+00:00,thebean,"Saw a TSX A-Spec today in Royal Blue with what looked like red interior. I was behind it at a stop light, so the interior color was a bit hard to see with the tint. Looked sharp."
46,2019-09-07T03:03:31+00:00,Michaell,"My other choice in '91 was the Civic Si. However, insurance guy told me it would be more expensive than the Sentra.

In retrospect, I should have convinced the then-wife that we needed to spring for the SE-R"

Speaking of new cars, I hate the payment, but 5 months in, I still enjoy driving the wagon. Maybe THIS will be the lease I buy out. We'll see."

McLaren. Not sure which one, but not the smallest one."

11,2019-09-16T17:52:26+00:00,laurasdada,"Where I work, the company owns the building & land (pricey suburb of Boston), four buildings. The times they are a changing; much renovation and shuffling of employees from four buildings to two. Other two are now renovated and being leased to other companies. These include an asset manager, a precious metals firm and Morgan Stanley branch.

This has had a fun effect on the parking lot; this morning, as I exited my car, I watched a very new looking, shiny green Bentley Continental GT convertible (grille looked bigger than me!) pull in to the Morgan Stanley parking lot, followed by a new looking BMW 7, M850 convertible and Audi A8.

Once again, my poor career choices are echoed in the cars that surround me daily!"
12,2019-09-16T18:24:19+00:00,thebean,"@laurasdada - If you want to feel better about your career choices, go check out the employee parking lot of any retail establishment in the country."
13,2019-09-18T00:56:34+00:00,andres3,Such as Wal-Mart.

15,2019-09-19T16:29:41+00:00,thebean,"Yesterday on I-40 in New Mexico, a recent vintage Challenger with a Charger Daytona high wing. Could not have been any more strange looking. Also, looked to have trim and wheels blacked out."
16,2019-09-19T18:33:57+00:00,laurasdada,"Within a couple of minutes, two Genesis G70, white and blue. Handsome, if derivative, beast."

18,2019-09-19T22:05:28+00:00,fintail,"Saw an Edge ST in traffic, along with an Audi Q8 (or maybe SQ) doing rich housewife duty at a Costco."

20,2019-09-29T19:45:11+00:00,fintail,"Saw either a Ferrari F8 or late 488 today, freshly plated, don't remember the details to differentiate (similar window shape). I was in the fintail, driver gave me a thumbs up."
21,2019-09-29T22:33:49+00:00,fintail,"Also saw 3 Ford EcoSports in like an hour - they still seem somehow ""off"" to me, and I can't imagine who buys them, must be some deals (not apparent rentals)."
22,2019-09-29T22:35:45+00:00,Michaell,"I've spotted a couple of them in the past week or so, as well.

Yes, the proportions do seem odd."
23,2019-09-29T23:18:02+00:00,ab348,"Examined a Kia Niro up close today. It is nicely styled, better than the Sportage, and seemed to me to be almost the same size as the Caddy XT4 I drove this week, just a bit smaller I think. Interior was OK but certainly a lot more plasticky given the price point. According to reviews its biggest drawback is that it isn't very zippy. Only has something like 139hp/195 torque. If it had more power it might be a more appealing offering."
24,2019-09-30T14:10:34+00:00,fintail,"Older woman who parks near me in my building leases a Honda every 2/3 years, she's been around long enough where I've seen 3 or 4 cars. She just got a new one, moderate spec HRV. Apparently this one is a purchase."

Not sure that one is a great look with those colors.

It seems woefully underpowered with a 1.6NA engine delivering only 121hp/113torque via a CVT."

28,2019-10-01T13:26:15+00:00,fintail,"What did that Colt weigh, like 1900 lbs?

I suspect this new rig weighs like 3700 lbs."
29,2019-10-01T14:50:12+00:00,stickguy,About a ton probably.
30,2019-10-01T15:02:30+00:00,Michaell,"Venue - 2250 to 2730 lbs, from what the interwebs state."
31,2019-10-02T14:59:05+00:00,JustinS,I was surprised to see this on the road here in Tampa last night!

43,2019-11-03T23:01:28+00:00,fintail,"Went car looking at the MB dealer while running an errand today. Nothing too unusual, but they did have a couple new GLS, which is a clear evolution from the old one. I sat in one, and didn't find the ICE hard to work with, which surprised me as I have read complaints (but I didn't talk to it). The touchpad made changing nav screen settings quite easy and intuitive, like working on a laptop. Funny thing though, the one in the showroom was an absolute base model, it even had a credit for ""standard features not included"" (I think maybe some ICE functions and fancier headlights). Never seen that on a MB sticker before. Fleet spec I guess, 73K sticker. But the one outside, filthy looking apparently from being on a car hauler, was quite loaded with an 89K sticker. The fancier one also had an interesting feature - open pore (matte finish) wood with a wood wheel. In the past, wood wheels were only for cars with shiny wood. New thing for 2020 I guess. I also notice on the E, finally, the widescreen digital dash is included with the first tier (virtually mandatory in prior years) premium package, which means the analog gauges, which are awkward to me, are effectively gone from the E."
44,2019-11-05T19:41:10+00:00,fintail,"Saw the upper-middle new Caddy SUV/CUV this morning, I've seen a couple in the past few days."
45,2019-11-05T20:27:04+00:00,stickguy,Pointed an XT4 out to the wife (caddy palace shares a lot with BMW palace). Liked the color. Did not like front end at all. Might drive one anyway since they pay $50 too!
46,2019-11-05T21:13:29+00:00,ab348,"Geez, the front end is one of its most attractive features. It's hardly a Nissan Juke or an angry RAV4."
47,2019-11-05T21:55:03+00:00,kyfdx,"Parked behind a Volvo XC40, this weekend. Told my wife it was really popular. She doesn't like it. I think it's that reverse kick-up on the C-Pillar, that doesn't look right to her.

I liked it."
48,2019-11-05T23:26:14+00:00,andres3,"I saw the large Acura sedan RLX???? , the rarest of sightings on the roadway. They must of sold all of these to people that never drive."

There was a lane between us when I got along side of them, me on the left, due to traffic.

Makes for some really poor lease payments ($700's)"

But I can see why people like them. I did a dog placement interview for someone that had a new Telluride and they absolutely raved over it."
25,2019-12-17T00:15:38+00:00,tjc78,Nice vehicle ... but why would you pay $700 for that when you could have an X5 or loaded XC90 for less monthly?
26,2019-12-17T00:17:16+00:00,stickguy,"I would not be leasing one of them, so don't ask me!

I wonder what percentage of them are getting leased now? BMW I assume it is approaching 100% at this point."
27,2019-12-17T00:21:40+00:00,tjc78,"I’d bet it’s 50/50... some people just don’t know leasing and shop for the best deal on a particular model.

I have a friend who does some wild things with cars and leased his wife a Ram. Pretty well equipped (high 50s) and when he told me the payment (in the 7’s) I almost died. It was the first year of the new model and whatever edition/trim it was didn’t have great incentives. I didn’t go any further but I hope it was with zero drive off at least."
28,2019-12-17T00:30:18+00:00,stickguy,"at least with the lease, even if it was not a good deal, you just make your payments for 3 years and end up at the same point. If that # fits your budget, just enjoy the car and don't think about it!

I would be shocked if the next one for us is a lease. And only if it is some wild deal where I can make the lease to buy #s actually work out (every time I have tried, it ends up cheaper to buy at the beginning)."

30,2019-12-17T01:27:39+00:00,stickguy,"sounds much nicer. but even worse to me than the extra length, is the way they keep making the front ends so huge, tall and blocky."
31,2019-12-17T11:27:07+00:00,tjc78,"The new Tahoe will be a big hit.... for sure. I like it.

Just think what the new Escalade will be like based off of it. GM is trying to one up the Expedition/Navigator that is apparent."
32,2019-12-20T17:43:54+00:00,stickguy,New sonata. Man that is unique. Long and low. Looks like an Audi and a Citroen mated. Can’t wait to see how that sells.
33,2019-12-20T18:25:35+00:00,stickguy,"Also a new venue. Tiny little box, but not bad looking.

Did not get inside the venue or sonata."
34,2019-12-20T21:23:54+00:00,tjc78,I like the new Sonata.... what I don’t like is only 180HP. Is a higher output power train coming?
35,2019-12-20T21:37:30+00:00,laurasdada,"Was in LA for a few days, spotted a new...everything. Notably McClaren's and Ferraris, a Lambo Urus; 911 are to LA what 3 Series are to Boston. Driving on the 405, side by side with a Ferrari Portofino, a very handsome man eyed enviously my rented Kia Optima; probably mistook it for a Stinger."
36,2019-12-20T21:54:02+00:00,stickguy,"Not that has been reported. But always possible. In this class, probably not that important since most buyers go with the base motor anyway."
37,2019-12-20T23:39:33+00:00,fintail,I've seen a number of Audi Q8 on the road in the past few days.
38,2019-12-21T00:36:56+00:00,Michaell,I thought I had read somewhere that the new Kia optima was going to have a TwinTurbo engine with just under 300 hp. I wouldn't be surprised if the same engine found its way into the Sonata.
39,2019-12-21T01:31:18+00:00,imidazol97,I just see a 2.5 L and 1.6 L turbo in the Sonata offerings.
40,2019-12-21T01:48:19+00:00,Michaell,Could be a late release...
41,2019-12-21T02:10:07+00:00,qbrozen,...with FWD. a Korean Buick GS.
42,2019-12-21T02:50:44+00:00,stickguy,"those are the 2 engines. much different, but pretty close in HP. Different torque characteristics though I think. comparable performance I assume."
43,2019-12-21T03:21:25+00:00,kyfdx,"The lower trims get 191 HP, NA engines, higher trims get 180 HP turbo engines.

Weird.

Guessing they have a supply issue for the turbo? Possible that the higher torque from the turbo translates to better acceleration?"
44,2019-12-25T16:05:08+00:00,kyfdx,"First time ever, Honda Clarity. Then, an hour later, a 2nd one!"
45,2019-12-25T16:05:53+00:00,kyfdx,"Also, new Volvo V90 wagon. I like that a lot"
46,2019-12-25T18:07:24+00:00,fintail,"Funny how cars can still vary by region. Being on the west coast, I have seen countless Clarity. Kind of makes me think of a Japanese Citroen."
47,2019-12-25T21:08:10+00:00,kyfdx,"Yeah, not a fan of the aero fender skirts"
48,2019-12-28T20:43:56+00:00,kyfdx,Next door neighbor’s brother showed up with this.
49,2019-12-28T20:49:30+00:00,tjc78,So they did sell more than one!
0,2019-12-28T21:10:09+00:00,Michaell,"Looks great from the outside; it's the inside that is disappointing, in my mind."
1,2019-12-28T21:15:52+00:00,fintail,Maybe the only one in red?
2,2019-12-28T21:17:34+00:00,kyfdx,Yeah surprising. You could fit an 8 foot ladder in that thing.
3,2019-12-28T22:30:34+00:00,imidazol97,Actually I see a good number. I recall seeing two today.
4,2019-12-28T22:44:40+00:00,jpp75,"I still remember the one we sat in the auto show, the interior was so disappointing compared to the exterior. GM really needs to step it up with their interiors all around."
5,2019-12-28T23:48:05+00:00,fintail,"I think I've seen maybe not many more than two total of the Buick wagon ever. Even more uncommon than an MB wagon, which probably costs on average 2.5x more.

GM once again taking a normal Euro market car and marketing it as near-lux, shades of the Catera (hopefully more reliable)."
6,2019-12-29T00:17:14+00:00,Michaell,"Isn't 2020 the last year for the Regal? I know Opel is part of PSA now, and they are joining up with FCA, likely next year."
7,2019-12-29T00:27:44+00:00,fintail,"That's right, and I wouldn't be surprised if the same is true for the Holden/Opel/Vauxhall badged versions. China apparently might keep it, however. The PSA thing is pretty weird, unlikely partners, not sure if I see the ""synergy"", as drones would say."
8,2019-12-29T03:58:15+00:00,Michaell,It is true. Read somewhere about the demise of the Commodore nameplate down under.
9,2020-01-01T15:50:47+00:00,kyfdx,"Spotted another Regal TourX, yesterday. They don't stick out so much in gray.."
10,2020-01-08T18:05:09+00:00,fintail,"Saw a 6er GT in traffic yesterday, so they sold one!"
11,2020-01-08T18:44:28+00:00,tifighter,"I found myself driving over one of our mountain passes in the X, along with an Urus and a Cayenne Turbo. It felt like there should have been some magazine comparison going on or something."
12,2020-01-09T02:01:48+00:00,fintail,Sounds like the valet line at Bellevue Square (just need a Bentayga and AMG G)
13,2020-01-12T02:19:04+00:00,laurasdada,"Blue Porsche Taycan. On the dealer floor, very sharp. What the Panamera should look like. Locked, no Monroney."
14,2020-01-12T12:17:25+00:00,explorerx4,"Yesterday, someone test driving a black Fiata convertible with the top down.
New record high temp of 68 degrees."
15,2020-01-13T21:51:41+00:00,laurasdada,Two! Jag I-Pace.
16,2020-01-19T01:19:28+00:00,fintail,Saw one of the upper-middle Caddy SUV/CUVs that kind of looks like a Volvo XC90.
17,2020-01-21T00:57:08+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new Escape on the road today. Not as offensive in person as in pics, probably because over time we are being numbed to yet another cloned CUV."
18,2020-01-21T01:21:53+00:00,Michaell,"I've seen a couple recently, as well. I'll admit it's a nice contrast to the sharp angles of the RAV4."
19,2020-01-21T02:16:10+00:00,ab348,"The nearby Ford dealer had a bunch of 2020 Escapes parked next to a bunch of 2019s. You could tell they were different but I can’t say the new one looked better. Some aspects were, some weren’t."
20,2020-01-21T02:33:28+00:00,stickguy,"I saw an Escape tonight too. I think I actually prefer the RAV4 this generation. Mainly because I prefer a CUV to be a little boxy, for better space utilization in the cargo area."
21,2020-01-21T03:28:25+00:00,fintail,"Faux floating C-pillar on the RAV4 triggers me, and not in a good way. The Toyota corporate face does it no favors, either. Maybe not a surprise, I prefer the first gen, back when cars could be cheeky and fun."
22,2020-01-21T11:56:25+00:00,tjc78,Now that I have to look at a RAV all the time in front of my houses (Mom’s) it’s really not that offensive. It’s also light years ahead of the previous one in terms of the ride and drive.
23,2020-01-21T14:23:00+00:00,stickguy,And looks. I might take a drive in a hybrid version if the wife likes it at the car show. Too bad they get crazy expensive for a nicely equipped one. Also looking at crv hybrid when they come out. But also pricey.
24,2020-01-21T14:56:21+00:00,texases,I’m also considering the RAV4 hybrid. I worry about Honda’s bad record with hybrids.
25,2020-01-21T17:52:06+00:00,fintail,"CRV aint pretty, but I think I would prefer it. That C-pillar is just so dumb, I wouldn't be able to stop looking at it, and would probably paint it body color myself. Fortunately, I am not a bloggermom with sensible vehicle size tastes/retired 70 year old teacher/dad who has completely lost his freedom, so one isn't on my radar"
26,2020-01-23T00:03:17+00:00,fintail,"Saw a black Rolls-Royce Cullinan today - what would Marie Antoinette drive? If the guillotines are (finally) ever dusted off, those things will be like a beacon."
27,2020-01-23T01:34:09+00:00,sda,"As much as the CRV is not a looker, it has great space management for its size and is comfortable and drives well. They have solid resale as well."
28,2020-01-23T01:42:11+00:00,ab348,The CRV’s turbo engine woes would concern me. Many older models up here suffered from premature rust out so badly that Honda had to buy them back. So who knows...
29,2020-01-23T02:54:20+00:00,stickguy,"I was monitoring the gas in oil issue but not seen anything lately. So hopefully resolved, and pretty isolated anyway. I am curious about the differences for the hybrid too. But definitely something to consider. Not an issue really if we lease though!

I think it is pretty good looking, for what it is, and really like the interior. Nice seats, plenty of features, and good cargo room. Just have to see how it drives!"
30,2020-01-23T02:57:14+00:00,qbrozen,"I like the sound of guillotine for a car name. LOL.
Introducing the Lincoln Guillotine. Always ahead of its competition."
31,2020-01-23T03:27:48+00:00,sda,I hear you. Rust and turbo woes I think are more of a northern cold climate issue. Rarely do we see rust in this area unless the vehicle is not local. Sun damage to paint and interior is more common. Often a one or two year old CRV isn’t much cheaper than buying new.
32,2020-01-23T03:29:13+00:00,stickguy,it has been a long time since worrying about rust was even on my new car consideration checklist. Just doesn't exist any more.
33,2020-01-23T12:25:07+00:00,ab348,"Clearly not the case in climates that use road salt, for certain makes."
34,2020-01-23T13:05:40+00:00,imidazol97,"Or ""the cutting edge"" of auto luxury.
""Slicing to the top of its class."""
35,2020-01-24T20:23:34+00:00,fintail,"6er GT in white and a new style G-Wagen in white, I think it was a G63 (from a distance), seems harder than ever to find a non-bling G."
36,2020-01-26T02:38:43+00:00,fintail,"As I am about to mark 10 months in the wagon, it finally happened - a near twin parked near me:



Not identical, as it is an E400 with sport trim, but similar enough. No shock, this was at Whole Foods (where I wanted to buy a $4 container of cheese I can't find elsewhere - and they were out, because of course). I see ab348 was there too."
37,2020-01-26T17:18:36+00:00,tjc78,I’ve yet to see an identical white S60 to mine. I did see a burgundy Momentum trim a few days ago.
38,2020-01-26T18:10:00+00:00,fintail,"I have yet to see my twin either - the wheels on my car will make that fairly difficult as they were an extra cost option that doesn't seem to be the most popular (but I like the design a lot, suits the car). I recall going through nationwide inventory when I got the car, and didn't find anything completely identical when it comes to interior trim and options."
39,2020-01-26T19:24:21+00:00,tjc78,"When I was shopping there weren't many white on white Inscriptions. Not a high take rate I'm sure.

Love the wheels on your wagon. Similar to my car."
40,2020-01-26T21:34:28+00:00,fintail,"Your car is in a great color combo, I wish the white/porcelain colors on MB were more common - I love the brown in mine, but white on white would have been pretty awesome, too.

Those wheels are also nice, a pretty design without the false pretense of sport. I don't want an aggressive design, I don't need to pretend to be exciting."

If I was a betting man, yours is the clean one at the far left."
42,2020-01-27T04:01:06+00:00,fintail,"Yep. The wheels on my car are only available on ""luxury"" trim cars, which might be 1:10 of the production mix, if that.

43,2020-01-28T21:46:32+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new style G-Wagen in white, just after a final run style G also in white with the rare ""night package"" (black trim on fenders and roof). Both AMG of course, so hard to find a non-AMG model."
44,2020-01-29T17:46:16+00:00,kyfdx,"Bentley Bentayga

Meh.."
45,2020-01-29T17:48:16+00:00,laurasdada,"Yes, I've seen a few of the Bentayga, totally meh-worthy. I'd go Urus... Or, DBX when available. Of course, Powerball win first."
46,2020-02-04T00:57:56+00:00,fintail,"Went to Whole Foods again in search of a $4 piece of cheese never in stock, and saw 2x E wagons - one was the same I posted before, and also a dark blue one with ID plates. I suppose the car fits the store. Not new, but also saw an Eclipse Cross on the road, not a rental! Could have been an ex rental, or someone actually bought a new one."
47,2020-02-08T20:52:52+00:00,fintail,"Saw a Caddy XT5 ""400"", apparently they are badging for torque now."
48,2020-02-08T20:58:39+00:00,explorerx4,"400 is a torque measurement, but not FT/LBS.
Maybe newton meters?"

0,2020-02-10T17:55:45+00:00,stickguy,A new Supra drove past my house yesterday. Sharp looking in person. And low.
1,2020-02-10T18:16:05+00:00,qbrozen,"I saw one yesterday or the day before, as well. Didn't seem too impressive in person. It was a dark gray. I actually, for a split second, thought it was just an FRS."
2,2020-02-10T19:11:31+00:00,kyfdx,Saw one at the car show.. Roof looks tacked on. You can tell they built the car as a convertible (BMW Z4)
3,2020-02-11T01:08:08+00:00,fintail,"Not brand new, but I saw a blue G-Wagen 4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4 in city traffic today."
4,2020-02-15T05:40:51+00:00,fintail,"Saw a CX-30 today, it's a CUV. Also 2x Mazda3 super blindspot edition."
5,2020-02-16T20:54:14+00:00,laurasdada,"Went to a Mazda CX-30 intro event at my local Mazda dealer Thursday night. Surprisingly large crowd (small showroom, though) and well catered; enjoyed a fabulous grilled cheese BLT, cheeseburger and crab cake sliders as well as cupcakes... Good swag, nice waterbottles and a few tchothkes.
CX-30 should be a winner, as I posted elsewhere a seemingly roomier and, to me, better looking 3."
6,2020-02-17T00:23:14+00:00,stickguy,Sat in it yesterday. It was very nice and roomy enough to be comfortable. A little too small for us to use it as a primary vehicle.
7,2020-02-18T20:33:04+00:00,texases,"I followed a new MB E300 for a bit. Nothing unusual, but I've seen very few new E class. See lots of MB CUVs, of course, and a fair number of C class sedans, but very few E class sedans, which used to be their bread and butter."
8,2020-02-19T01:25:58+00:00,fintail,"Not too surprised. The only data I immediately find, for Q4 2019, combined all car-type E variants (including CLS) with sales down 29.1% YOY. Meanwhile, GLE sales were up 45.9%. C-class car sales were down 12.7%.

It's the segment, apparently. 5er sales were down 34.6%, A6 only 3% (but less than half the volume of others), and Lexus GS sales down 44.1%, with a mere 808 units sold."
9,2020-02-19T04:02:04+00:00,laurasdada,"Geez, I'd better buy my new sedan while they still exist..."
10,2020-02-19T21:06:50+00:00,explorerx4,"@laurasdada,
I bought my MKZ because they are going to stop making them, but I didn't want an end of the run car."
11,2020-02-21T20:53:12+00:00,tjc78,First one I've seen in the wild.
12,2020-02-21T20:54:44+00:00,stickguy,I’ve seen a bunch recently. A couple live near me. Must be selling some!
13,2020-02-22T01:16:19+00:00,fintail,"Saw a newish Model S today, pearl white with aftermarket wheels. I didn't hate it, somehow the package worked."
14,2020-02-22T03:22:46+00:00,andres3,"I saw a new looking Mustang GT350 and it looked sharp and menacing. Not fake sporty menacing like a Hyundai, but real deal-like.

Don't see these actually being driven on the freeway like I did today. Rare sighting."
15,2020-02-22T23:55:53+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new Supra today, pulling out of a BMW dealer lot, which I found amusing."

17,2020-02-29T23:39:27+00:00,stickguy,I love that neat design map light!
18,2020-02-29T23:43:52+00:00,tjc78,I remember that map light as a kid. I can’t remember if my Dad’s 86 Shelby Charger had or the 87 Shadow Turbo. Heck maybe both had it.
19,2020-03-01T00:11:03+00:00,explorerx4,"Sorry, I posted in the wrong thread, but glad it was enjoyed, like I did."
20,2020-03-01T01:49:55+00:00,fintail,"My brother's first car was an 85 K-Car (ca. 1995), it or his Sundance Duster may have had that light, it's really familiar to me, as well.

Must have been an era for map lights. I remember my mom's Tempo had a map light on a stalk that was hinged on the roof like behind the rear view mirror/dome light area."
21,2020-03-03T23:23:54+00:00,ab348,I must have missed previous chatter on this. It looks somewhat appealing. https://www.caranddriver.com/ford/fusion-wagon
22,2020-03-03T23:55:16+00:00,qbrozen,"I’ll take a Sport model with 2.7TT, please."
23,2020-03-04T00:05:53+00:00,tjc78,"So today was F8 Green Dodge day.

Saw the Trifecta.

Dealer tagged Durango
Charger
Challenger

What are the odds of seeing all three in this (rare) exact same color all with my “favorite” black wheels."
24,2020-03-05T22:15:04+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new unplated facelift Q7 today, at Whole Foods of course."
25,2020-03-11T21:54:47+00:00,ab348,First pics of the new Hyundai Elantra:
26,2020-03-11T22:16:46+00:00,texases,"Nice, except for the 'keep out' bar between the passenger and driver..."
27,2020-03-16T22:02:58+00:00,explorerx4,"Over the weekend, at night, a new Sonata.
Easy to tell by the lighting.
The guy in the left left turn lane, in a few years old Sonata, was staring at it as it went by and didn't realize the light had turned green until he started getting honked at by the other cars in his lane."
28,2020-03-17T20:58:34+00:00,fintail,"Had to run an errand, had some cabin fever, stopped by the MB dealer for a lookie-loo. Nothing too exciting in the new section, I did notice a couple GLBs - MSRP in the low 40s, another niche is found, it's just substantial enough that it may sell. Used area was more interesting - brown 15 S63, magno (matte) grey E63 wagon with full carbon fiber package, 14 E63 sedan with wheels I've never seen before (multispoke usually seen in black, these were silver), 17 C43 coupe in rare diamond silver, a couple of G wagens (AMG, unfortunately, but one had a top line designo and carbon fiber interior). Also walked over to the Porsche lot, didn't see anything eletric, did see a pile of Cayenne coupes, a couple of leftover 19 911 turbos with ""sale"" prices of less than 10% off MSRP, likely rare XC90 Polestar in blue on the used side."
29,2020-03-21T17:45:55+00:00,kyfdx,This..
30,2020-03-21T19:47:31+00:00,stickguy,I could live with one of those. not the payments though.
31,2020-03-22T00:17:04+00:00,imidazol97,Is that a Cincy photo? Under the Columbia Pkwy extension with P&G towers in the background?
32,2020-03-22T00:21:45+00:00,fintail,"Saw a white Supra on the road today, the new BMW one."
33,2020-03-22T14:23:50+00:00,kyfdx,"Good eye.. Parking lot off Eggleston. That's one of the domes on the right, and I think the Deloitte building straight ahead (formerly, Chiquita building).

The photo is from my son, who was riding his bicycle over that way."

35,2020-03-28T00:01:59+00:00,fintail,"My new walking route takes me down what was known as ""auto row"" here, with 5 dealers still there I think (mostly AutoNation, because legalized monopoly). I noticed every Ford on the lot had its driver's window down an inch or two - dozens of cars. Some kind of Corona thing? Volvo had a bunch of S60s but all beigegrey save for one red (they have what seems like 100 XC cars at an offsite lot). Ford dealer also has a somewhat miled up but very clean and nicely basic spec older G-Wagen in the used car backlot."

There's a new non-AMG G-wagen sitting on the now-closed showroom floor. I'll probably saunter over and take a look."
39,2020-03-31T15:56:56+00:00,fintail,"And it's locked, damn. Dark grey on dark grey/black designo manufaktur interior, multispoke wheels, non-AMG ""plain"" G550, 155K MSRP. Not my first color choice, but I like it otherwise.

I'm still the only customer here, which will be something to remember as this is a busy dealer."
40,2020-03-31T17:16:57+00:00,fintail,"One other customer arrived as I was leaving, Service adviser said their daily bookings have gone from 100+ to ~10. He liked my car, too, asked if it was a custom order, complimented the condition.

Showroom was full, had something from almost every model IIRC. That grey non-AMG G would be my pick."
41,2020-04-04T01:35:35+00:00,fintail,"I notice the Ford dealer on my walking route has a ton of Explorer STs in stock, seems like 20 or more, I thought those would be uncommon. Nothing else new seems unusual on my walking route past a few dealerships, other than the Caddy dealer having a crapton of new Escalades, the end of the line before the new model coming up.

I also notice the Ford dealer is shuffling used cars around every couple days, so someone is working somewhere."
42,2020-04-04T02:13:52+00:00,Michaell,About half the requests I get for Explorers are for the ST trim.
43,2020-04-04T20:00:34+00:00,fintail,"I walked by again today and didn't notice a single non-ST Explorer. I guess I assumed they'd be something uncommon.

Nothing else of note on the lot, Expedition supply seems high, but no doubt nothing is selling right now."
44,2020-04-04T20:24:47+00:00,ab348,A lot of early reviews were mixed too.
45,2020-04-05T20:14:40+00:00,explorerx4,"Avalon TRD, even weirder than I thought."
46,2020-04-05T21:12:04+00:00,tjc78,"The biggest problem I have with the Avalon is the front grill. I can't get past it and would never own that style because of it.

Having said that... I really don't mind the TRD treatment. It looks pretty sharp along the sides, even with the black wheels.

It is a bit of a sin to do all that work and not massage more power out of the engine. The 2GR is a pretty sweet engine as is, but a sport model should have more power.

To wrap up, this is not the first time Toyota did a sport Avalon. In 2005+ they had a Touring version with charcoal wheels, a spoiler and a stiffer suspension."
47,2020-04-05T22:35:39+00:00,fintail,Hard to believe that Toyota made cars that had no excess styling.
48,2020-04-07T21:28:46+00:00,laurasdada,Current version Ford GT; black with silver stripes. Perhaps a Patriot? (I live just down the road from Gillette Stadium).

Since the dealers are closed I stopped by a couple on my way home to look up-close at what I had only seen driving around until now.

There is a massive and posh brand-new VW facility here that just opened a little while ago, relocating from their former little steel building that dated from the 1960s. They have a lot more room to store inventory too. I wanted to look at the new Atlas Cross Sport. The regular Atlas never did much for me but these appeal to me a bit more. They had several in inventory but what caught my eye was one with a V6 in metallic red with a tan-and-black interior, very sharp. Seemed pricey to me though at $55K in worthless Canadian dollars. They also had a couple of new Golf R models on the front row, both black unfortunately.

Just next door was the Kia dealer run by the same group and the Seltos was in abundance. That is a really sharp looking little rig. They had one in a metallic green-gold that was a bit garish but sure caught the eye. There was one next to it in a dark metallic blue that I liked as well. Also saw my first Palisade up close and personal, too big for me but very nice.

My last stop was the Toyota dealer where they had exactly one new Corolla hatch. Nice enough inside but I hope they come in different trims than this one. Lots of Corolla sedans on the lot along with a huge fleet of various SUV/CUV models."
1,2020-04-11T16:12:27+00:00,fintail,"Saw some high zoot newish Charger yesterday - had smoked license plate covers so dark you effectively couldn't see the plate, the worst I've seen. Daddy must be a cop.

Not new, but in my hour of outside time yesterday, I must have seen 10 G-wagens, apparently that group is getting out."
2,2020-04-16T16:55:49+00:00,fintail,"Saw my first new C8 on the road, white with roof panel removed. Amused me to see a late 70s model shortly after."
3,2020-04-18T01:32:26+00:00,fintail,"Saw a white Lambo Uterus on the road - not as Marie Antoinette as a Bentayga or Cullinan, but trying. Also a new style G-Wagen, AMG of course."

The wagon is beautiful"
7,2020-04-22T16:53:21+00:00,fintail,"The GLS is meant to go against the Slade or Navi. G is in a world of its own, kind of a mixed demographic comprising Kardashian types/Russian mafia/various money laundering or dynastic wealth types.

The wagon appears to be stock/configurator photos so far, but I'll probably stop by and look at it when it arrives, just because it is so similar to mine."

11,2020-04-22T17:33:27+00:00,Michaell,"Though, someone one the Wrangler lease thread mentioned an Unlimited with a $75k MSRP"
12,2020-04-22T17:33:58+00:00,tjc78,75K? What?
13,2020-04-22T17:36:38+00:00,fintail,"I'd rather have one G than 2 75K Jeeps.

They both have stupidly high depreciation floors, too. A nice 2002 G with 200K can fetch 25K."
14,2020-04-22T17:47:19+00:00,Michaell,Probably $20K of dealer accessories on it - none of which can be residualized.
15,2020-04-22T17:51:05+00:00,kyfdx,"I think you can only hit about $59K on the Wrangler, without dealer installed items."
16,2020-04-22T17:52:37+00:00,tjc78,Gotcha. Forgot about dealer installed stuff.

18,2020-04-29T17:44:17+00:00,fintail,"Finally got my C&D with the E450 wagon long term wrap-up. Man, it almost read like a paid advertisement, they loved that thing. Makes me feel a little better about the monkey on my back. I am also suspect of the resale claim - I can't find a year old absolutely loaded one like that for anywhere near the claimed value. Even base ones are a bit pricier."
19,2020-04-29T19:03:50+00:00,stickguy,"Can you find one with 40,000 miles on it?"
20,2020-04-29T19:08:32+00:00,fintail,"Nope. But the claimed resale is 20K++ from what one could find a similarly equipped car. Those must be some expensive miles.

I suspect the depreciation algorithm is using a higher rate based on the prior gen E-class facing faster depreciation due to being a discontinued model."
21,2020-04-29T19:13:45+00:00,stickguy,I have no idea what they are using for that. KBB trade? WAG?

23,2020-04-29T19:31:02+00:00,fintail,"ALG. Now that I think of it, I suspect maybe the option load isn't taken into account - I could see a more basic car with a value of their claimed 48K at those miles.

Facelift E also has a rear light treatment that seems Asian brand-inspired to my eyes, kind of Infiniti or Hyunkia-ish. It also gets the same headlight style as the A-class. I prefer the pre-facelift."

46,2020-05-19T12:02:53+00:00,qbrozen,I always thought the Toyota Edge... I mean Venza... was a good idea. Not sure why it didn’t sell better. Was a great used value for a while there.
47,2020-05-19T12:12:27+00:00,stickguy,"I liked those too. a little goofy looking (lifted and chopped at the same time, like a short person on stilts?) I do recall also it looked a bit off since they were an early adopter of oversized wheels (I think 20's) and that was a weird car to pick.

but, I agree that they needed a ""momma bear"" option. When we were shopping recently, I did look at Toyota. Wanted to like the RAV, but it was just a little bit too small. and the Highlander had some nice touches, but was definitely too big. So if they can slot in a 5 passenger with a bit more space and comfort, should be popular.

It is actually pretty good looking to me. and this factoid was interesting: Venza will differ from every other U.S.-maker crossover in that it will be available only as a hybrid and only with all-wheel drive."

A few of the MB's were thought worthy of a car cover, but the sun beats down on everything, and that hood ornament is usually the first breaking point in a car cover, and most of them were sticking out as it creates a stress/tension point in the car cover, which is where it'll fail first under the hot sun."

Hopefully they knew it was a feature. Didn't bother me after that.

Or A3 now has around 55K and except for wanting an extra quart of oil very now and then, has been flawless. Sure, it's already had two batteries replaced under warranty and a new set of sneakers, but much more trouble free then my Golf has been. Part of me wants to just take it over once she wants to trade it in but not sure I really would want a sedan to be honest. I want a new hatchback but now that the current oil leak is fixed, holding on a bit even though the axle boots are both in need of repair. But to buy something new when my commute is down to 21 miles/week just doesn't make sense right now. Even though it's a great time to buy if one does have the $!! Love the 0% financing to be honest and the delayed 1st payment period but what to buy is the question."
37,2020-07-13T18:53:05+00:00,laurasdada,Two Maserati QPs (current) within 5 minutes yesterday. Perhaps a 2 for 1 sale at the local dealer?

One house had a new Bentley SUV and a drop dead gorgeous newer Bentley convertible. Dark blue with brown top. I figure the 2 card alone were close to 400k sticker."

Maybe 1:10000 G-Wagen on this continent actually do more than visit a gallery mall/office building/questionably purchased house, so maybe 1:100000 new ones."

2,2020-07-25T19:36:28+00:00,stickguy,back from a week at the shore. car spotting heaven. at least 5 new Excursions (plus a Navigator). Popular beast for the well to do beach house crowd! A pair of GL63 hunchbacks. one in cement. along with a new 911 targa (I think based on the roof style). 2 different cement colored Raptors. temp tag panamera just street parked on a busy road. more Wranglers (mostly customized) than at a Jeep dealer. assortment of big MBs.

You mean Expeditions? Excursions haven't been made for many years."
5,2020-07-25T20:52:41+00:00,fintail,"Saw a new 911 cabrio driving down my mom's small town street this morning - car probably cost more than the value of almost any house on the street, things change fast in the PNW when you get a certain distance away from the interstate. Also a couple new Telluride in town, interesting as the nearest Kia dealer is an hour away."
6,2020-07-25T21:33:52+00:00,Michaell,"Saw an article on the Telluride - Kia dealers have, on average, a 15 day supply of them. Still selling for over MSRP.

What's odd is that the Hyundai variant can be had with a discount from sticker."

9,2020-07-25T23:59:46+00:00,ab348,The Telluride is impressive looking while the Hyundai looks just like a bigger Hyundai SUV. I browsed Kia Canada's website yesterday and looked at the Telluride. To get what I would want (a light-colored interior) I needed to select the top-line trim at $54K + taxes/fees. That a lot of money for a Kia even in worthless Canadian dollars.

It was here when I visited a couple months ago, and I paid little attention to it, but walked by it and noticed it is unusual - loaded Platinum AWD model. Surely many don't exist like that, given the fleet nature of the car. Also odd in that the nearest Nissan dealer is at least an hour away."
15,2020-07-27T01:17:47+00:00,benjaminh,"A while ago I saw a VW Arteon. The rear quarter window treatment for this car seems unique and very good, providing interesting styling with flush glass, as well as better rear visibility."
16,2020-07-27T01:22:07+00:00,texases,That's the best rear window I've seen in a long time.
17,2020-07-27T01:34:11+00:00,stickguy,overall looks a lot like an Accord.
18,2020-07-27T01:40:43+00:00,benjaminh,"But the VW Arteon gives you better rear visibility than the somewhat more thick pillars in the Accord. I assume there are some advantages to the Accord design, since almost all cars use something like this, rather than the very thin dividers found in the Arteon. I assume it adds structural strength."
19,2020-07-27T11:44:45+00:00,ab348,"I think the Accord design makes for a shorter (front to back) rear door window which allows it to roll down into the door. The Arteon door glass and structure looks like the glass might just fit when it rolls down or it may have an articulating window regulator. Both are far superior to the very awkward design c/w black plastic triangles in the C-pillar that GM used on the outgoing Buick Regal and the current Cadillac CT5, which should never have been let out of the design studio."
20,2020-07-27T11:53:55+00:00,sda,"The Arteon is a hatchback, nicely styled. Too bad they are too expensive. A base model is mid $30s. Depreciation could be significant making it a good used buy."
21,2020-07-27T14:15:24+00:00,laurasdada,"I think it was Car and Driver that , in a review, called the Arteon a great car that no one will buy."
22,2020-07-27T14:24:19+00:00,Michaell,"Agreed. It is sharp looking, in person, but when you get into the top trim levels that price out in the mid $40's, you begin to seriously think about an A5 Sportback."
23,2020-07-27T20:00:57+00:00,andres3,Or a Golf R.
24,2020-07-28T23:07:24+00:00,benjaminh,"Here's the structure underneath the new TLX. That pillar near the back window looks sturdy.

I know the Honda Accord is built to something like 4 times the federal roof crush standard, and I'm sure Acuras are the same way, if not even stronger. It might be that VW with that cool design was fully meeting the roof crush standard, but maybe not exceeding it by as large a margin?"
25,2020-07-28T23:09:59+00:00,stickguy,pretty cool!

Would be nice if Chevy didn’t use confusing names like that. I guess tesilblazer is a lot smaller, so a bulked up trax?"

I looked at a Trailblazer on a dealer lot and the front seat cushions (and overall front seat space) seemed really narrow."
30,2020-09-11T14:21:38+00:00,imidazol97,Ohio just quit requiring a front license plate after decades of having one required. A few people complained so often... and the legislators gave in. What will the inmates do since they only have to make half as many new plates?
31,2020-09-11T16:23:07+00:00,fintail,"Front plates have been a thing in WA since forever, and I doubt it will change. Always amuses me how there isn't a national policy on this, but I guess states rights - unless certain people are offended, of course.

I don't know how stringently it is enforced, at least locally, for people above a certain socio-economic line though. It seems most upmarket sporty/exotic cars and a huge amount of Teslas (not the same thing) lack a front plate, and it doesn't matter."
32,2020-09-11T16:23:49+00:00,fintail,"That's a heck of a loaner. Local dealer uses mostly C and GLA.

Some dealers use big window banners here, some are discreet."
33,2020-09-11T16:46:31+00:00,imidazol97,"The lack of front plate makes it more difficult for law enforcement to find cars on wanted list, if they still have the correct plates on the car. The front plates on cars make it easy for states like Florida to ID that a car approaching slightly over the limit is out-of-state and is fair game for a quick profit.

For a long time here in a lower income community most cars had only one plate. The question I asked was what car is the other plate on: it was sort of a buy one get one free for plates on your car. Okay as long as you don't get stopped for something in the car to which the plate is not registered."
34,2020-09-11T16:54:56+00:00,fintail,"Yep, there's definitely valid reasoning behind it, and front plates are mandatory in all other first world locations (that I know of anyway). I guess I'd just like to see more logical mandates in this part of the world, and consistency in terms of enforcement.

Funny, as I am pretty sure cars with vintage or year of manufacture plates here only need one at rear. I guess if one is going to commit crimes, use an old car"
35,2020-09-11T17:26:05+00:00,kyfdx,Indiana and KY don't seem to have any issues with one plate.

38,2020-09-11T22:10:01+00:00,andres3,"I doubt it makes it any more difficult for law enforcement than ticketing a speeder going 86 MPH vs. one going 85 MPH does. Front plates are not justified even for the extra weight, extra gas usage/waste, and extra emissions due to that extra weight they create, and that's very little, but still not justified. Lower taxes, 1/2 the amount of plates we have to pay for! 1/2 the aluminum we have to waste."
